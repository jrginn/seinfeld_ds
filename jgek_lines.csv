0,JERRY," Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why we’re here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about “We should go out”? This is what they’re talking about...this whole thing, we’re all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we’re all out! There are people tryin’ to find us, they don’t know where we are.  “Did you ring?, I can’t find him.” “Where did he go?” “He didn’t tell me where he was going”. He must have gone out. You wanna go out",1
1,JERRY,"  See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. It’s too high! It’s in no-man’s-land. You look like you live with your mother.",1
2,GEORGE, Are you through? ,1
3,JERRY," You do of course try on, when you buy?",1
4,GEORGE," Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don’t actually recall considering the buttons.",1
5,JERRY," Oh, you don’t recall?",1
6,GEORGE,"  Uh, no, not at this time.",1
7,JERRY," Well, senator, I’d just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.",1
8,GEORGE," Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where’s the orange indicator?",1
9,JERRY," Can you relax, it’s a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.",1
10,GEORGE, How come you’re not doin’ the second show tomorrow?,1
11,JERRY," Well, there’s this uh, woman might be comin’ in.",1
12,GEORGE," Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?",1
13,JERRY," I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?",1
14,GEORGE," No, you didn’t!",1
15,JERRY," I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing... ",1
16,GEORGE, Ha.,1
17,JERRY,"  There’s no milk in here, what...",1
18,GEORGE," Wait wait wait, what is she...  What is she like?",1
19,JERRY," Oh, she’s really great. I mean, she’s got like a real warmth about her and she’s really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.",1
20,GEORGE,"  So, you know, what, what happened?",1

24,GEORGE, This is great!,1
25,JERRY, Yeah.,1
26,GEORGE," So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!",1
27,JERRY," Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we’ll get together. ",1
28,GEORGE,"  Ho ho ho, ‘Had to’? ‘Had to’ come in?",1
29,JERRY," Yeah, but...",1
30,GEORGE, ‘Had to come in’ and ‘maybe we’ll get together’? ‘Had to’ and ‘maybe’?,1
31,JERRY, Yeah!,1
32,GEORGE," No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. You’re not gonna see this woman.",1
33,JERRY," What, are you serious...why, why did she call?",1
34,GEORGE," How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite. ",1
35,JERRY, To be polite? You are insane!,1
36,GEORGE," All right, all right, I didn’t want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?",1
37,JERRY, Yes!,1
38,GEORGE," You’re a back-up, you’re a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!",1
39,JERRY," Oh, I get it, this is about the button.",1
40,GEORGE," Claire, Claire, you’re a woman, right?",1
41,GEORGE," Uhm...I’d like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.",1
42,GEORGE,"  Now, a woman calls me, all right? ",1
43,GEORGE, She says she ‘has to’ come to New York on business...,1
44,JERRY, Oh you are beautiful!,1
45,GEORGE," ...and, and ‘maybe’ she’ll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?",1
46,GEORGE, To be polite. I rest my case.,1
47,JERRY," Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you’re talking about, now, come on, come with me.  I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.",1
48,GEORGE, I’m not gonna watch you do laundry.,1
49,JERRY," Oh, come on, be a come-with guy.",1
50,GEORGE," Come on, I’m tired.",1
51,GEORGE,"  Right, I knew I felt something!",1
52,GEORGE, Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment I’ve ever experienced. ,1
53,JERRY," Well, look at this guy. Look, he’s got everything, he’s got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.",1
54,GEORGE," I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...",1
55,JERRY, And you didn’t even hear how she sounded.,1
56,GEORGE, What?!,1
57,JERRY, Laura.,1
58,GEORGE, I can’t believe-  WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!,1
59,JERRY," Yeah, but how could you be so sure?",1
60,GEORGE," ‘Cause it’s signals, Jerry, it’s signals!  Don’t you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin’ tomorrow night, if you were busy?",1
61,JERRY, No.,1
62,GEORGE, She calls you today and she doesn’t make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It’s Saturday night!,1
63,JERRY, Yeah.,1
64,GEORGE," What is that? It’s ridiculous! You don’t even know what hotel she’s staying at, you can’t call her. That’s a signal, Jerry, that’s a signal!  Signal!",1
65,JERRY, Maybe you’re right.,1
66,GEORGE, Maybe I’m right? Of course I’m right.,1
67,JERRY," This is insane. You know, I don’t even know where she’s staying! She, she’s not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.",1
68,GEORGE," I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why don’t you just see if it’s dry?",1
69,JERRY," No no no, don’t interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it’s doing. Just let it finish.",1
70,GEORGE, You’re gonna overdry it.,1
71,JERRY," You, you can’t overdry.",1
72,GEORGE, Why not?,1
73,JERRY," Same as you can’t overwet. You see, once something is wet, it’s wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die you’re dead, right? Let’s say you drop dead and I shoot you. You’re not gonna die again, you’re already dead. You can’t overdie, you can’t overdry.",1
74,GEORGE,  Any questions?,1
75,JERRY, How could she not tell me where she was staying? ,1
76,GEORGE, Look at that. They’re done! ,1
77,JERRY," Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...y’know, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, it’s dark, there’s bubbles happening, they’re all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, “C’mon babe, let’s go”. You come by, you open up the lid and they’ll-  Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they’re in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, “Tomorrow, the dryer, I’m goin’. You wait here!” The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you don’t see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So they’re showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isn’t your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first. ",1
78,JERRY,"  If you know what happened in the Met game, don’t say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, I’m sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no ",1
79,JERRY,  Yeah?,1
80,KRAMER, Are you up?,1
81,JERRY,"  Yeah.  Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.",1
82,KRAMER," Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh? ",1
83,JERRY,"  Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, it’s a tape! I taped the game, it’s one o’clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.",1
84,KRAMER," Hey, I’m sorry, I- you know, I, I thought you knew.  You got any meat?",1
85,JERRY," Meat? I don’t, I don’t know, go... hunt!  Well what happened in the game anyway?",1
86,KRAMER,"  What happened? Well, they STUNK, that’s what happened!",1
87,KRAMER," You know, I almost wound up going to that game.",1
88,JERRY,  Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven’t been out of the building in ten years!,1
89,KRAMER, Yeah.  Are you done with this?,1
90,JERRY, No.,1
91,KRAMER," When you’re done, let me know.",1
92,JERRY," Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.",1
93,KRAMER, I thought I wasn’t allowed to be in here this weekend.,1
94,JERRY," No, it’s okay now, that, that girl is not comin’. Uh, I misread the whole thing.",1
95,KRAMER, You want me to talk to her?,1
96,JERRY, I don’t think so.,1
97,KRAMER," Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer.",1
98,JERRY," That close, huh?",1
99,KRAMER, You better believe it.,1
100,JERRY," Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.",1
101,KRAMER," Oh, give me it...let me talk to her.",1
102,JERRY,"  No believe me, I’m always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...",1
103,KRAMER,  SLIDE! Wow!,1
104,JERRY," No, it’s, it’s just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it.  Ten-fifteen... No, don’t be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, it’s no trouble at all... I’ll see you tomorrow... Great, bye.  I don’t believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here! ",1
105,JERRY," If my father was moving this he’d had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way.  'Have you got your end?...Your end’s got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end’s got to come down.'",1
106,GEORGE," You know, I can’t believe you’re bringin’ in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why don’t you bring in an extra guy too?",1
107,JERRY," Look, it’s a very awkward situation. I don’t wanna be presumptuous.",1
108,GEORGE," All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?",1
109,JERRY," All right, she said she couldn’t find a decent hotel room...",1
110,GEORGE, A decent hotel-room...,1
111,JERRY," Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.",1
112,GEORGE," You can’t be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag?  This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal! ",1
113,JERRY,"  This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?",1
114,GEORGE, I think I was affected by the caffeine. ,1
115,GEORGE," Ho, ho, ho, good dog, good dog...",1
116,KRAMER," Hey, he really likes you, George.",1
117,GEORGE," Well, that’s flattering. ",1
118,KRAMER," Oh, he’s gettin’ a drink of water.  Is this for that girl?",1
119,JERRY, Yeah.,1
120,KRAMER, Why even give her an option?,1
121,JERRY," This is a person I like, it’s not “How to score on spring break”.",1
122,GEORGE," Right, can we go? ‘Cause I’m double-parked, I’m gonna get a ticket.",1
123,JERRY," Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.",1
124,GEORGE, So what? That’s good.,1
125,JERRY," Now, how could that be good?",1
126,GEORGE," Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin’ around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin’ over, “I’ve gotta tidy up?” Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.",1
127,JERRY, This is how you operate?,1
128,GEORGE," Yeah, I wish.",1
129,JERRY, Let me just wipe the sink.,1
130,KRAMER, Why even give her an option for? ,1
131,KRAMER,  It’s unbelievable.,1
132,GEORGE, Yeah.,1
133,KRAMER, How’s the real estate-business?,1
134,GEORGE,"  It’s uh, not bad, it’s comin’ along. Why? Did you need something.",1
135,KRAMER, Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?,1
136,GEORGE," Well, I might be getting into that.",1
137,KRAMER,  You keep me posted!,1
138,GEORGE," I’m aware of you.  All right, let’s go  Let’s go!",1
139,JERRY," The dating world is not a fun world...it’s a pressure world, it’s a world of tension, it’s a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, ‘cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don’t know what they need. I know I don’t have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I’m- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we’re all human beings, what is the story? I’ve never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I’ve never been in a situation, when I thought to myself",1
140,JERRY, Wouldn’t it be great if you could ask a woman what she’s thinking?,1
141,GEORGE," What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she’s thinkin’.",1
142,JERRY," You know, instead, I’m like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.",1
143,GEORGE," Listen, listen, don’t get worked up, ‘cause you’re gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.",1
144,JERRY, Really? How?,1
145,GEORGE, ‘Cause it’s all in the greeting. ,1
146,JERRY, Uh-huh.,1
147,GEORGE," All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that’s a good sign.",1
148,JERRY, Right.,1
149,GEORGE," You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.",1
150,JERRY, Lip area.,1
151,GEORGE, You know a hug,1
152,JERRY, Hug is definitely good.,1
153,GEORGE, Sure.,1
154,JERRY," Although what if it’s one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?",1
155,GEORGE," That’s so brutal, I hate that.",1
156,JERRY, You know how they do that?,1
157,GEORGE," That’s why, you know, a shake is bad.",1
158,JERRY," Shake is bad, but what if it’s the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?",1
159,GEORGE, Hand sandwich.,1
160,JERRY, Right.,1
161,GEORGE," I see, well, that’s open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes. ",1
162,JERRY," Hey, hey.",1
163,JERRY, It’s good to see you.,1
164,JERRY, This is my friend George.,1
165,GEORGE," Hi, how are you?",1
166,JERRY, This is Laura.,1
167,GEORGE," Laura, sure.",1
168,JERRY,  I can’t believe you’re here.,1
169,JERRY,"  Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?",1
170,GEORGE," Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasn’t in the manual, I don’t know.",1
171,JERRY," So uh, what do you think?",1
172,JERRY," Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home.  So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?",1
173,JERRY," Uh, yeah, I think I do.",1
174,JERRY," Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead.",1
175,JERRY," Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don’t you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin’ anything?",1
176,JERRY, Really? What would you like to do?,1
177,JERRY,"  Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not.  I’m just, I’m really glad you’re here.",1
178,JERRY,"  Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on.  Um, it’s for you.",1
179,JERRY,  You’re engaged?,1
180,JERRY, You’re engaged? ,1
181,JERRY,  You’re engaged. ,1
182,JERRY, Yeah.,1
183,JERRY, Me too!,1
184,JERRY," I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don’t get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, I’m not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they’re so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that’s it! It’s the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don’t know ‘bout that, we don’t know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we’ve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! “I don’t think she likes me.” The amazing thing is, that we still get women, don’t we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. That’s why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like",1
185,JERRY," So, I’m on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...",2
186,JERRY," Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it’s a woman in front of you that’s writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, y’know, ‘cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don’t know where that is, but the cheque book",2
187,ELAINE, “Coccoon II,2
188,JERRY," Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Y’know Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, she’s probably screamin’ at those aliens, “I gotta have a lo mein!”",2
189,ELAINE," Okay, what’re we doing here? I have seen everything.",2
190,JERRY, Oh yeah? I don’t believe you’ve seen... this.,2
191,ELAINE," Oh, lovely.",2
192,JERRY, Yeah.,2
193,ELAINE, What do you think their parents think?,2
194,JERRY," “So, uh, what’s your son doing now, Dr. Stevens?” “Oh, he’s a public fornicator. Yes, he’s a fine boy...”",2
195,ELAINE, Y’know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela’s birthday.,2
196,JERRY, Pamela? Do I know her?,2
197,ELAINE," Yeah, you met her when we were going out.",2
198,JERRY," Oh yeah, right...",2
199,ELAINE," You have no idea who I’m talking about, do you?",2
200,JERRY,  No.,2
201,ELAINE," Blonde hair, remember? Glasses?  Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?",2
202,JERRY,  Riverside Drive.,2
203,ELAINE," Right! In fact... No, never mind...",2
204,JERRY," Well, what is it?",2
205,ELAINE," Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but...  you don’t want to go to... that... no.",2
206,JERRY," Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.",2
207,ELAINE, What little deal?,2
208,JERRY," I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.",2
209,ELAINE," A wedding? Have you lost it, man?",2
210,JERRY," Y’know, my parents are coming in for this...",2
211,ELAINE, They’re coming in?,2
212,JERRY," Yeah, tomorrow.",2
213,ELAINE," Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?",2
214,JERRY," No, no. Still doin’ the big sweep across.",2
215,ELAINE, Why does he do that?,2
216,JERRY," Doesn’t think anyone can tell. So c’mon, do we have a deal?",2
217,ELAINE, A wedding?,2
218,JERRY, There’s a lot of people to mock...,2
219,ELAINE," All right, what the hell.",2
220,JERRY, Great!,2
221,ELAINE, C’mon lets go...,2
222,JERRY, Was I supposed to bring something?,2
223,ELAINE, You could have.,2
224,JERRY, I met her one time...,2
225,ELAINE, It is not necessary.,2
226,JERRY, What did you say then?,2
227,ELAINE, Sssshhhhhh!!!,2
228,ELAINE," Hi, Pamela, you remember Jerry.",2
229,JERRY," Hi, happy birthday.",2
230,JERRY, I didn’t bring anything.,2
231,JERRY," Oh, Okay  I’m sorry, I didn’t know what to bring, nobody told me.",2
232,JERRY, I’m in for five...,2
233,JERRY,  Uh-oh... What do we have here?,2
234,JERRY," Oh, I can’t. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.",2
235,JERRY," Plus I’m wearing short sleeves, I don’t want to expose my tattoos.  She’s unbelievable!",2
236,JERRY,"  What’s going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, she’s too good to be alone. What’s the difference, I can’t maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.",2
237,JERRY," Uh, friend of a friend. And you?",2
238,ELAINE,"  Oh, Jerry!",2
239,JERRY,"  Oh no, not now.",2
240,ELAINE, I had this dream last night and you were in it.,2
241,JERRY," Oh really?  Oh God, I gotta get out of this.",2
242,ELAINE," You were you, but, you weren’t you...",2
243,JERRY," No kidding.  Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!",2
244,ELAINE," I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...",2
245,JERRY,  This is brutal.,2
246,ELAINE, You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.,2
247,JERRY," How do you like that? Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I can’t, I can’t. I’m stuck.",2
248,ELAINE,  Jerry? Are you listening to me?,2
249,JERRY," Yes, I heard you.",2
250,JERRY,"  Thank you, Pamela!  So, you’re a lawyer...",2
251,JERRY,"  Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft...  Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.",2

255,JERRY,"  I can’t believe it. I got nothing! I don’t even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...",2
256,JERRY," That wasn’t so bad, really.",2
257,ELAINE," Y’know, um, you could use a little work on your manners.",2
258,JERRY, Why? What did I do?,2
259,ELAINE," Wel-Well, I just don’t appreciate these little courtesy responses, like I’m selling you aluminum siding.",2

267,ELAINE, So nothing! Nothing. ,2
268,JERRY," Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, “Yeah, I got this new thing",2
269,JERRY, Hey!,2
270,JERRY," This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!",2
271,JERRY," What are you talkin’ about? It’s fine, I love having you here.",2
272,JERRY," Ma, will you stop?",2
273,JERRY, I don’t care. I’m sleeping next door.,2
274,JERRY," No, he’s making a bouillabaisse.",2
275,JERRY," So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?",2
276,JERRY," Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?",2
277,JERRY," No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I don’t know her name.",2
278,JERRY," Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can’t ask her.",2
279,JERRY, Because it’s complicated. There’s some tension there.,2
280,JERRY," Oh yeah, she’s great.",2
281,JERRY," Well, it’s a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...",2
282,JERRY, You don’t know what it was.,2
283,JERRY," Well, we fight a lot for some reason.",2
284,JERRY, And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.,2
285,JERRY," Oh, she is, she absolutely is.",2
286,JERRY," No, it’s not that. It wasn’t all one-sided.",2
287,JERRY," I know, I know...",2
288,JERRY, That’s got nothin’ to do with it.,2
289,JERRY," What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn’t the one.",2
290,JERRY," I dunno, maybe...",2
291,JERRY," I can’t. She’ll get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.",2
292,JERRY, We’re friends.,2
293,JERRY, Oh yeah.,2
294,JERRY, I guess.,2
295,JERRY, You mean stakeout the lobby?,2
296,JERRY, Y’know what? This is not that bad an idea.,2
297,GEORGE, What does she look like?,2
298,JERRY, I dunno. Hard to say.,2
299,GEORGE, What actress does she remind you of?,2
300,JERRY, Loni Anderson.,2
301,GEORGE, Loni Anderson?!,2
302,JERRY," What, there’s something wrong with Loni Anderson?  Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.",2
303,GEORGE," Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? ",2
304,JERRY, I’m a little nervous.,2
305,GEORGE," Yeah, me too...",2
306,JERRY," If I see her, what do I say that I’m doing here in the building?",2
307,GEORGE, You came to see me. I work in the building.,2
308,JERRY, What do you do?,2
309,GEORGE, I’m an architect.,2
310,JERRY, You’re an architect?,2
311,GEORGE, I’m not?,2
312,JERRY, I don’t see architecture comin from you.,2
313,GEORGE,  I suppose you could be an architect.,2
314,JERRY, I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin’ else.,2
315,GEORGE," All right, she’s not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.",2
316,JERRY," Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?",2
317,GEORGE, We’re having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.,2
318,JERRY, What is his name?,2
319,GEORGE, Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.,2
320,JERRY, Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.,2
321,GEORGE," No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....",2
322,JERRY, Art Cor...,2
323,GEORGE, ...velay.,2
324,JERRY, Corvelay?,2
325,GEORGE," Yeah, right.",2
326,JERRY," Well, what does he do?",2
327,GEORGE, He’s an importer.,2
328,JERRY," Just imports, no exports?",2
329,GEORGE,"  He’s an importer/exporter, okay?  Elaine ever call you back?",2
330,JERRY," No, I guess she’s still mad.",2
331,GEORGE," I don’t understand, you never talk to her about other women?",2
332,JERRY, Never.  Wait a second. That’s her. On the right.,2
333,GEORGE,  I forgot who I am! Who am I?!,2
334,JERRY, You’re you. We’re having lunch with Art Corvelay.,2
335,GEORGE, Vandelay!,2
336,JERRY, Corvelay!,2
337,GEORGE, Let me be the architect! I can do it!,2
338,JERRY," Hey, hey. uh Pamela’s birthday party, didn’t I see you there? Jerry.",2
339,JERRY," Uh, this is George.  I’m sorry...",2
340,GEORGE, Nice to meet you.,2
341,JERRY," Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.",2
342,JERRY," Oh, we’re meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.",2
343,GEORGE," Yeah, Art Vandelay.",2
344,GEORGE, ...And exporter.,2
345,JERRY, He’s an importer/exporter.,2
346,GEORGE,"  I’m, uh, I’m an architect.",2
347,GEORGE," Uh, railroads, uh...",2
348,GEORGE, They can...,2
349,JERRY, Y’know I’m sorry you had to leave so early the other night.,2
350,JERRY," Oh, that guy was your cousin! ",2
351,JERRY, Friend!,2
352,GEORGE," I’ll just, uh, get a paper...",2
353,JERRY," So, um, do you date uh immature men?",2
354,JERRY,"  Ma, will you go already?",2
355,JERRY, What are you doing?!,2
356,JERRY," You can’t look in there, we’re playing!",2
357,KRAMER, Hi.,2
358,JERRY, Hi.,2
359,KRAMER, Hey Morty!  Salad dressing?,2
360,JERRY, Look.,2
361,JERRY, Maybe!,2
362,JERRY," Ma, you can’t look up words in the dictionary!  Dad, she’s cheating!",2
363,KRAMER, “Quo”? That’s not a word.,2
364,JERRY," Well put something down, you’re taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, they’re all coming over here before the wedding?",2
365,JERRY, She said what?,2
366,JERRY," She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.",2
367,JERRY, She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...,2
368,JERRY," Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.",2
369,JERRY, Yes. Yes I am!  What else did she say on the phone?,2
370,JERRY," Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?",2
371,JERRY," Yeah, but now I’m nervous.",2
372,JERRY, “Quone”?,2
373,JERRY," “Quone”? No, I’m afraid that I’m going to have to challenge that.",2
374,KRAMER," No, you don’t have to challenge that. That’s a word. That’s a definite word.",2
375,JERRY, I am challenging.,2
376,KRAMER, Quone. To quone something.,2
377,JERRY, Uh-huh.,2
378,JERRY, No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.,2
379,KRAMER," Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him.",2
380,JERRY, You must have quite a time down there.,2
381,JERRY," Oh, I’m sorry. I’m just waiting for someone.",2
382,JERRY," Yeah, yeah...",2
383,JERRY," Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it.",2
384,JERRY, That’s perfect.,2
385,JERRY, Could you excuse me one second? I’m sorry.,2
386,JERRY," How do you do?  Uh, Jerry Seinfeld.",2
387,ELAINE," Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes.",2
388,JERRY," Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?",2
389,ELAINE," Oh no, let’s do it now.",2
390,JERRY," All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-",2
391,ELAINE, Okay.,2
392,JERRY," No, I’m gonna take my car.",2
393,JERRY," Anyway, you know why I didn’t ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.",2
394,ELAINE," Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.",2
395,ELAINE," Oh, bye. Good to see you.",2
396,JERRY," Oh, I’m sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.",2
397,JERRY,"  Yeah, “Levine”. And I’m Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.",2
398,ELAINE," Yeah, obviously.",2
399,JERRY," I mean, if we’re gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.",2
400,ELAINE, Couldn’t agree more.,2
401,JERRY, Good.,2
402,ELAINE, Good.,2
403,JERRY, Good.,2
404,ELAINE, Great!,2
405,JERRY, Great? Where do you get ‘great’?,2
406,ELAINE, It’s great to... talk about... other people...,2
407,JERRY, ...Guys?,2
408,ELAINE, Yeah.,2
409,JERRY," Uh-huh. Yeah. So, anybody specific?",2
410,ELAINE, No. A general guy.,2
411,JERRY, Oh really? Elaine Marie Benes...,2
412,ELAINE," What? No, it’s not a big deal.",2
413,JERRY," No, that’s great! That’s terrific!",2
414,ELAINE," No, we just met...",2
415,JERRY, Doesn’t matter. What’s the young man’s name? I would like to meet him.,2
416,ELAINE," Hmmm, I don’t think so.",2
417,JERRY," Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?",2
418,ELAINE, Wall street.,2
419,JERRY," Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.",2
420,ELAINE, And he happens to be pretty good lookin’.,2
421,JERRY,"  All right, sir.",2
422,ELAINE, And... he’s hilarious.,2
423,JERRY, Now that’s not fair! So where did you meet this guy?,2
424,ELAINE, I staked out his health club.,2
425,JERRY," Uh huh. When you’re on a stakeout, do you find it’s better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?",2
426,JERRY," Y’know I think that even if you’ve had a relationship with someone, or let’s say, especially if you’ve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, it’s very difficult. Isn’t this? It’s hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. It’s like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, “Look, a rabbit.” The other goes, “So? I believe this is your card.” “Look, why don’t we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?”",2
427,JERRY," So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. It’s a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and I’m supposed to feel bad. Is that the way it’s supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldn’t you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. ‘Cause it’s not easy to give someone the toe, you’ve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and...  “Look at that toe, buddy.”  I mean, that’s really insulting to get the toe, isn’t it?",3
428,JERRY," Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane.  That’s it. Done!",3
429,ELAINE,  That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.,3
430,JERRY,  I am...the master packer.,3
431,ELAINE,"  Yeah, right, you’re the master packer.",3
432,JERRY," What you must understand, Elaine,  packing is no different than leading men into battle.  You’ve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.",3
433,ELAINE,"  ‘Scuse me, master packer...",3
434,JERRY, Yes.,3
435,ELAINE, Just gimme your keys.,3
436,JERRY," All right, sir.  George?",3
437,GEORGE,  Yeah.,3
438,ELAINE," Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?",3
439,JERRY," Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.",3
440,ELAINE," Okay, this is quite a place.",3
441,JERRY, There’s more. The refrigerator.,3
442,JERRY," Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates.  No meat, no leftovers, no butter.  And I cannot overstate this",3
443,ELAINE, I’ll eat out.,3
444,JERRY," One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity",3
445,GEORGE,  Ready?,3
446,JERRY," Yeah, one sec.",3
447,GEORGE," Hey, Elaine.",3
448,ELAINE, Hi.,3
449,GEORGE, Coming to the airport with us?,3
450,ELAINE," No, I’m staying here for the weekend. I’m getting a break from my roommate.",3
451,GEORGE," Oh, the actress-waitress?",3
452,ELAINE," No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of “A Chorus Line”. So, now all day long she’s walking around the apartment singing, “God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it!” She’s gonna get it right in her...",3
453,GEORGE, So just kick her out.,3
454,ELAINE, She’s on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.,3
455,GEORGE," Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range.  But you, my friend, may be in luck.",3
456,JERRY, I’m not looking.,3
457,GEORGE," No no no, this one’s different. This one’s a beauty!",3
458,JERRY," Yeah, what’s it like?",3
459,GEORGE," I haven’t seen it yet, but it’s a two-bedroom, it’s on the uh, west 83rd, ‘bout a half block from the park?",3
460,JERRY, How much?,3
461,GEORGE," Uh, twice what you’re payin’ here, but it’s a great building. It’s two bedrooms!",3
462,JERRY, Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one.  I saw that.,3
463,ELAINE, You oughta at least take a look at it.,3
464,JERRY, Really? Why?,3
465,ELAINE, ‘Cause then I could move in here.,3
466,JERRY, Ohhhh...,3
467,ELAINE, It’s time you got outta here anyway.,3
468,GEORGE," Yeah, tell ‘im. But quickly, I’m double parked here.",3
469,ELAINE," Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you can’t have soft cheese...",3
470,GEORGE, Let’s not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.,3
471,ELAINE," Jerry, come on, you’re doin’ okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldn’t have to live like this.",3
472,JERRY, Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.,3
473,ELAINE," Well, for me it’s a step up. It’s like moving from Iceland to Finland.",3
474,GEORGE," Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?",3
475,JERRY," I can’t think about it now. Come on, I’m going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.													 ",3
476,JERRY, Elaine.  ELAINE!,3
477,ELAINE,"  JERRY!  Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?",3
478,JERRY," Great, I had fun. Where’s the TV, where’s the VCR?",3
479,JERRY, What?,3
480,ELAINE, They were stolen.,3
481,JERRY, Stolen? When?,3
482,ELAINE, A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.,3
483,JERRY, Stolen?,3
484,ELAINE,  Someone left the door open.,3
485,JERRY,  You left the door open?!,3
486,KRAMER," Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin’ and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, ‘cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!",3
487,JERRY," Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?",3
488,KRAMER,  The door.,3
489,JERRY, The door? You left the door open?,3
490,KRAMER," Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.",3
491,JERRY," Yeah, and?",3
492,KRAMER," Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. “The Bold And The Beautiful”.",3
493,JERRY, So the door was wide open?,3
494,KRAMER, Wide open!,3
495,JERRY,  And where were you?,3
496,ELAINE, I was at Bloomingdale’s... waiting for the shower to heat up.,3
497,KRAMER," Look, Jerry, I’m sorry, I’m uh- you have insurance, right buddy?",3
498,JERRY, No.,3
499,KRAMER,  How can you not have insurance?,3
500,JERRY, Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. It’s the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door...  ...MUST BE CLOSED!!,3
501,KRAMER," Jerry! I’m gonna find your stuff. I’m gonna solve it, I’m on the case, buddy, I’m on the case.",3
502,JERRY," Yeah, don’t investigate, don’t pay me back, it was an accident.",3
503,KRAMER,  I made a mistake.,3
504,ELAINE, These things happen.,3
505,KRAMER, I’m human.,3
506,JERRY, In your way.,3
507,ELAINE, Answering machine.,3
508,JERRY,"  Answering machine.  Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.",3
509,JERRY, It’s a joke.,3
510,JERRY, You ever find anything?,3
511,JERRY," Well, thanks anyway.",3
512,ELAINE, I didn’t get that joke either.,3
513,JERRY, The crook has the machine. The messages aren’t for him. He’s the crook. Why would he answer-  How did you get in here?,3
514,JERRY, Again?,3
515,GEORGE, I don’t know how you put up with this.,3
516,ELAINE," Yeah, tell ‘im George.",3
517,JERRY,  You would still wanna move in here?,3
518,ELAINE, Yes! You don’t understand. I’m living with Ethel Merman without the talent.,3
519,JERRY,"  Is that uh, other apartment still available?",3
520,JERRY," I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, it’s very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, “Call the police. You really should call the police.” So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, “Yeah, I’m calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... I’m gonna see some real action.” Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out",3
521,ELAINE," Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?",3
522,GEORGE," I didn’t know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.",3
523,JERRY, How do you get all that wood in here?,3
524,ELAINE, They deliver it.,3
525,JERRY, They deliver wood?,3
526,ELAINE, Yeah.,3
527,JERRY, What do you tip a wood guy?,3
528,GEORGE, I didn’t know there was a fireplace.,3
529,ELAINE, Look! Look at- look at this! There’s a garden.,3
530,GEORGE, A garden! I can’t believe there’s a garden!,3
531,JERRY, Would I have to get a gardener?,3
532,ELAINE," Yeah, you can get a gardener.",3
533,JERRY, You tip him?,3
534,ELAINE, You can.,3
535,GEORGE,  You don’t tip a gardener!,3
536,ELAINE, You can tip a gardener.,3
537,GEORGE, You don’t need a gardener.,3
538,ELAINE," Jerry, you can barbecue back here.",3
539,JERRY, They deliver the coal?,3
540,ELAINE," Sure, it’s...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.",3
541,JERRY," Oh, then I gotta tip him.",3
542,ELAINE," Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!",3
543,JERRY, I don’t have any plants.,3
544,GEORGE, I have plants. ,3
545,ELAINE," Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! I’m walking in it!  It’s a walk-in. Can you believe it? I’m nuts about this, what do you think?",3
546,JERRY," I like that.  What do you think, George?",3
547,GEORGE, It’s your decision.,3
548,JERRY," I’m takin’ it, I’m takin’ the place. I’m gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. I’m livin’ here...I’m movin’.",3
549,ELAINE,  Your movin’? That means I’m movin’.  Geeeeee  isn’t that incredible!,3
550,GEORGE,  Congratulations.													 ,3
551,ELAINE, What about the couch?,3
552,JERRY, You like the couch? I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do.,3
553,ELAINE, What?,3
554,JERRY," You’re movin’ in, you’re a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars.  Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I don’t even wanna see it, go, get it out.",3
555,ELAINE, A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?,3
556,JERRY, Yeah!,3
557,ELAINE, For this couch?!,3
558,JERRY," Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?",3
559,ELAINE," Okay, uh, I’ll tell you what. I could go as high as uh...  I don’t know, maybe...twenty dollars?",3
560,JERRY, Yeah?,3
561,GEORGE,"  Yeah, it’s George.",3
562,JERRY," Come on up.  Oh, all right, forget it, I’m gonna take it with me now...  I’m just gonna pack up the cushions right now...",3
563,ELAINE," Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.",3
564,JERRY,"  You wanna get the other end, ‘cause I wanna get it in the hall.",3
565,ELAINE," Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?",3
566,JERRY, Fifty dollars?,3
567,ELAINE, Uh-huh.,3
568,JERRY, Thank you very much.,3
569,ELAINE, Thank you very much.,3
570,GEORGE," Hey, what’s goin’ on?",3
571,ELAINE, I just bought Jerry’s couch for fifty dollars.,3
572,JERRY,"  So did you bring the lease?  All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.",3
573,GEORGE,"  Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.",3
574,JERRY, Why?,3
575,GEORGE," If you’re having second thoughts, if you didn’t want it, don’t worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.",3
576,JERRY, You could take it? You want it?,3
577,GEORGE," No, I don’t want it. I want it, if you don’t want it.",3
578,JERRY, So you do want it.,3
579,GEORGE," No I, I want it if you don’t want it.",3
580,JERRY, You just said you wanted it!,3
581,GEORGE," No, I’m saying, if a situation arose in which you didn’t want it, I might take it.",3
582,JERRY, So take it.,3
583,GEORGE, How can I take it?,3
584,JERRY, How can I take it?,3
585,GEORGE, It’s your apartment!,3
586,JERRY," How can I want it now, if you want it?",3
587,ELAINE," Excuse me, uh, I don’t mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?",3
588,GEORGE," Yes, but I am not taking it.",3
589,JERRY, I...am not taking it.,3
590,ELAINE," Well, one of you better damn well take it!",3
591,JERRY," Well, whaddaya wanna do here?",3
592,GEORGE," I, I don’t know.",3
593,JERRY, Do you wanna flip a coin?,3
594,GEORGE," Who flips? You’ll flip, I’ll call.",3
595,JERRY," Okay, fine.  This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and that’s it. Agreed?",3
596,GEORGE, I’m good.,3
597,ELAINE," I don’t know, who to root for, George’s place has carpeting.",3
598,JERRY," All right, now you call it in the air.",3
599,GEORGE, No catchin’.,3
600,JERRY, No no.,3
601,GEORGE, Flip it.,3
602,GEORGE, Heads!,3
603,JERRY, Tails!,3
604,GEORGE," No, it hit the table, it hit the table.",3
605,JERRY, So what?,3
606,GEORGE," Interference! You can’t count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.",3
607,JERRY, You didn’t call no interference!,3
608,GEORGE, You don’t have to call that! That’s a rule!,3
609,JERRY, I don’t believe this.,3
610,GEORGE," Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!",3
611,JERRY," I don’t wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?",3
612,ELAINE, I’d better not.,3
613,JERRY," Well, I’ll tell you what. I’ll choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...that’s it, you gotta win three.",3
614,GEORGE, Okay.  OK. I’ll choose you. Whaddaya want?,3
615,JERRY, Odds.,3
616,GEORGE, I want evens.,3
617,JERRY, Good.,3
618,GEORGE, You got odds.,3
619,JERRY, You got evens.,3
620,GEORGE," Right, ready?",3
621,JERRY, For the apartment.,3
622,JERRY, Mine!,3
623,JERRY, Mine!,3
624,GEORGE, Mine!,3
625,GEORGE, Congratulations...congratulations.,3
626,JERRY, Thanks.,3
627,GEORGE, I'm just gonna...wash.  WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?,3
628,KRAMER," Jerry, I think I’m on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?",3
629,JERRY, Yeah.,3
630,KRAMER, The last couple a days he’s been acting very strange. I think he’s avoiding me.,3
631,JERRY, Hard to imagine.,3
632,KRAMER, Yeah! And get this,3
633,KRAMER," ..you know, very casually,",3
634,JERRY, Right.,3
635,KRAMER,  so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.,3
636,ELAINE, So what did he say?,3
637,KRAMER, “What stuff?”,3
638,JERRY," Ooh,  case closed!",3
639,KRAMER," No, you don’t understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, I’m gonna go over there, I’m gonna borrow some tea. If I don’t get back in five minutes, maybe you’d better call the police.",3
640,JERRY," Okay, starting...NOW!",3
641,KRAMER, Yeah!,3
642,JERRY," One of the problems in life is that when you’re a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, “I got the front seat” “I wanted the front seat!” “I called it”. And the other kid knows he’s got nothing to say",3
643,GEORGE, I love the mirror in that bathroom! I don’t know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror.  I don’t know if it’s the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.,3
644,JERRY," It’s a good mirror.  So, what are you gettin’?",3
645,GEORGE," I don’t know, I can’t eat. You, you can’t have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs",3
646,JERRY," All right, forget it, forget it. I’m not taking the place!",3
647,GEORGE, What?!,3
648,JERRY, How can I live there?,3
649,GEORGE, Why not?!,3
650,JERRY," Look at you, you’re still thinking about it. I’ll never feel comfortable.",3
651,GEORGE," Oh, get outta here.",3
652,JERRY, How can I ever have you over? You’ll sit there moping.,3
653,GEORGE, I won’t mope.,3
654,JERRY, You’re already moping! Would you take the place?,3
655,GEORGE," No, impossible! It’s your apartment.",3
656,JERRY, You found the place.,3
657,GEORGE, You won the choose.,3
658,JERRY," All right, forget it, it’s over, I’m not moving.",3
659,GEORGE," Well, me neither.",3
660,JERRY, Definitely?,3
661,GEORGE, Definitely.,3
662,JERRY," Alright, then just get rid of it. You won’t have any problem.",3
663,GEORGE," No, it’s not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.",3
664,GEORGE," Oh, it’s a great place, it’s uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd ‘bout half block from the park.",3
665,GEORGE," I don’t know, what we’re doin’ here, this is ridiculous.",3
666,JERRY, She wanted to thank us for the apartment.,3
667,ELAINE, I can’t believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.,3
668,JERRY, If only the coin hadn’t hit the table.,3
669,GEORGE," The table is interference, you know it!",3
670,JERRY, It is not!,3
671,GEORGE, It is too!,3
672,ELAINE, My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on “Carousel”.,3
673,GEORGE," Hi, Carol.",3
674,GEORGE, We’re really glad for you.,3
675,ELAINE, Couldn’t be happier.,3
676,JERRY, It’s wonderful.,3
677,GEORGE," We’re aware of the proximity to the park, yes.",3
678,GEORGE, Nice meeting you.,3
679,JERRY," How late are the stores open? I’m thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head.",3
680,JERRY," Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guy’s out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, it’s true, men hear a drill, it’s like a dog whistle. Just...  you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, “Honey, I think Jim’s working on something over there.” So they run over to the guy. Now they don’t actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. That’s what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, “What are you using, a Phillips-head?” You know, we feel involved. That’s why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, that’s just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they don’t cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. “What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, that’ll hold.”",4
681,GEORGE, I had to say something.  I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.,4
682,JERRY, I don’t think you did anything wrong.,4
683,GEORGE, I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I don’t tell you.,4
684,JERRY, We can only thank God for that.,4
685,GEORGE, I’m outta the picture. I am outta the picture.  It’s only a matter of time now.,4
686,JERRY, You’re imagining this. Really.,4
687,GEORGE," Oh, no. No no no no.",4
688,GEORGE, I’ll tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.,4
689,JERRY, What floss? When?,4
690,GEORGE," We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; there’s this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.",4
691,JERRY," Ah, mint.",4
692,GEORGE," Of course. So, I’m looking at it. I look up, I see she’s looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..",4
693,JERRY," So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.",4
694,GEORGE," If I didn’t put that floss in my pocket, I’d be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.",4
695,JERRY, And you’re sure the floss was the catalyst?,4
696,GEORGE," Yes, I am.",4
697,JERRY, You don’t think it might’ve had anything to do with that?,4
698,GEORGE, What? You don’t like this?,4
699,JERRY, It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.,4
700,KRAMER,"  Oh, they’ve got a cure for cancer. See, it’s all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George.  Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.",4
701,JERRY,  Who is it?,4
702,KRAMER, Take it.,4
703,JERRY, Who is it?,4
704,KRAMER, It’s for you.,4
705,JERRY,"  Hello?  Oh, hi Joel.  No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesn’t know anything. He’s just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. I’m meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesday’s okay... All right. Uh, I’m a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye.  Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.",4
706,KRAMER," Well, it’s your phone. He wanted to talk to you.",4
707,JERRY, Maybe I didn’t want to talk to him.,4
708,KRAMER," Well, why not?",4
709,JERRY, He bothers me. I don’t even answer the phone anymore because of him. He’s turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.,4
710,GEORGE, What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? We’re not going?,4
711,JERRY, We’re going. That’s next Wednesday.,4
712,GEORGE, Oh. Who is this guy?,4
713,JERRY, His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I would’ve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. He’s so self-involved.,4
714,KRAMER," That’s for me.  Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...",4
715,JERRY, Can you conduct your business elsewhere?,4
716,KRAMER,  No no no. I’m talking about a whole chain of ‘em. Yeah.,4
717,GEORGE," I don’t know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, I’ll tell you that.",4
718,JERRY, I don’t bother with him. He’s been calling me for seven years. I’ve never called him once! He’s got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if he’s paying attention.,4
719,GEORGE, I don’t understand why you spend time with this guy.,4
720,JERRY," What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, “I don’t think we’re right for each other.” He’s a guy! At least with a woman, there’s a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.",4
721,GEORGE," No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.",4
722,JERRY, Just break up with him?,4
723,GEORGE, Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.,4
724,JERRY, The Truth.,4
725,JERRY," As a guy I don’t know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I don’t know how to say, “Bill, I feel I need to see other men.” Do you know what I mean? There’s nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think that’s the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because they’re two guys. That’s almost all we need to have in common. ‘Cause sports – sports and women – is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, “So, what’s in the refrigerator?”",4
726,JERRY," You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-",4
727,JERRY,"  So, I’m thinking about going to Iran this summer.",4
728,JERRY," Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform.  You know, it’s their annual terrorist luncheon.",4
729,JERRY,  I’m gonna do it in Farsi.,4
730,JERRY," Yeah, I’ll have the egg salad on whole wheat.",4
731,JERRY, How can you talk to someone like that?,4
732,JERRY," Listen, Joel. There’s something I have to tell you...",4
733,JERRY, Howard Metro.,4
734,JERRY," Listen, Joel, I don’t think we should see each other anymore.",4
735,JERRY, This friendship,4
736,JERRY, We’re just not suited to be friends.,4
737,JERRY," Look, you’re a nice guy, it’s just that... we don’t have anything in common.",4
738,JERRY," Y-You didn’t do anything. It’s not you, it’s me. It’s- this is very difficult.",4
739,JERRY," No, it’s not that.",4
740,JERRY," Oh, come on. That’s not true.",4
741,JERRY," I know, I know.",4
742,JERRY, Best friend- I’ve never been to your apartment.,4
743,JERRY," Okay, okay. Forget it. It’s okay. I didn’t mean it.",4
744,JERRY, What I said. I’ve been under a lot of stress.,4
745,JERRY," Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it. I took it out on you. We’re still friends. We’re still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, I’ll tell you what. I’ve got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.",4
746,JERRY," No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I would’ve said tonight.",4
747,JERRY,  Yes.,4
748,JERRY, Next Wednesday.,4
749,GEORGE, ...she calls me up at my office,4
750,JERRY, Yeah.,4
751,GEORGE,"  she says, “We have to talk.”",4
752,JERRY," Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.",4
753,GEORGE," That, or “Who’s bra is this?”",4
754,JERRY, That is worse.,4
755,GEORGE," So we order lunch, and we’re talking. Finally, she blurts out how it’s ‘not working’.",4
756,JERRY, Really.,4
757,GEORGE," So, I’m thinking, as she’s saying this, I’m thinking",4
758,JERRY, Hm. You ate.,4
759,GEORGE," We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.",4
760,JERRY," Someone says, “Get out of my life,” and that doesn’t affect your appetite?",4
761,GEORGE, Have you ever had their egg salad?,4
762,JERRY, It is unbelievable.,4
763,GEORGE, It’s unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didn’t even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.,4
764,JERRY, How much could you possibly have in there?,4
765,GEORGE, It’s my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.,4
766,JERRY," Yeah? Where’d he go, to an arcade?",4
767,GEORGE,  That’s funny. You’re a funny guy.,4
768,JERRY," C’mon, move up.",4
769,GEORGE, Ewing’s hurt? How long is he going to be out?,4
770,GEORGE, Geez.,4
771,JERRY," Oh, God.",4
772,GEORGE, I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.,4
773,JERRY," Listen, George, little problem with the game.",4
774,GEORGE, What about it?,4
775,JERRY," The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..",4
776,GEORGE, What?,4
777,JERRY, I gave your ticket to Horneck.,4
778,GEORGE,  You what?!,4
779,JERRY," Yeah, I’m sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.",4
780,GEORGE, No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?,4
781,JERRY," C’mon, c’mon, go ahead, move up.",4
782,GEORGE, Why did you give him my ticket for?,4
783,JERRY, You didn’t see him. It was horrible.,4
784,GEORGE," Oh, c’mon, Jerry. I can’t believe this.",4
785,JERRY, I had to do it.,4
786,GEORGE," Oh, please.  Can you change this into bills?",4
787,JERRY, Do you want to go with him? You go. I don’t mind.,4
788,GEORGE," I’m not going with him. I don’t even know the guy.  Look, they did this for me before.",4
789,GEORGE," You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!",4
790,JERRY," No, I do not like the bank. I’ve heard the expression “Laughing all the way to the bank.” I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when there’s nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, it’s empty and you still have to go through the little maze.  “Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? I’m almost at the front. I’d like a reward for this please.”",4
791,GEORGE," ...thirty-two, thirty-three-",4
792,JERRY, George.,4
793,GEORGE, Not now.,4
794,JERRY, Could you stop the counting?,4
795,GEORGE, Nnnnnnngaaa!,4
796,GEORGE, What?!,4
797,JERRY, Can I make it up to you? I’ll give you fifty bucks for the jug.,4
798,GEORGE," Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.",4
799,JERRY," Well, then I’m not going to the game either. Okay? I’ll give him both tickets.",4
800,GEORGE," Oh geeeee.  Go, go!",4
801,JERRY," I- no, I don’t want to go.",4
802,GEORGE, He was really crying?,4
803,JERRY," I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and I’ll just make up some excuse why I can’t go to the game either.",4
804,GEORGE," Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as you’re going to lie to the guy, why don’t you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?",4
805,JERRY," George, the man wept.",4
806,KRAMER," Oh, hey guys. Man, I’m telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.",4
807,GEORGE, This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?,4
808,KRAMER," Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.",4
809,GEORGE," You know, you have to know how to do that. You can’t have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!",4
810,KRAMER, It’s all supervised.,4
811,GEORGE," Oh, well...",4
812,KRAMER, All of it. You want to invest?,4
813,GEORGE, My money’s all tied up in change right now.,4
814,KRAMER," No, I’m tellin’ you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.",4
815,JERRY," I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I can’t imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but that’s me. Alright",4
816,KRAMER, That’s you.,4
817,JERRY, I’m just saying..Alright.,4
818,KRAMER," Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.",4
819,JERRY, Okay.,4
820,KRAMER," You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.",4
821,KRAMER," One day, you’ll beg me to make your own pie.",4
822,JERRY,"  Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I can’t make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, he’s got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. They’re at the Will-Call window... And I’m really sorry... Have a good time... We’ll talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I don’t... Fine.. Fine... Bye.",4
823,GEORGE, Trapezoid?,4
824,JERRY, I know. I’m really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.,4
825,ELAINE," Come on, let’s go do something. I don’t wanna just sit around here.",4
826,JERRY, Okay.,4
827,ELAINE, Want to go get something to eat?,4
828,JERRY, Where do you want to go?,4
829,ELAINE," I don’t care, I’m not hungry.",4
830,JERRY, We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.,4
831,ELAINE, What are we gonna do there? Talk?,4
832,JERRY, We could talk.,4
833,ELAINE, I’ll go if I don’t have to talk.,4
834,JERRY, Then we’ll just sit there.,4
835,ELAINE," Okay. I’m gonna check my machine first.  Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...",4
836,JERRY," Okay, just hand that over, please.",4
837,ELAINE," Oh, what is this?",4
838,JERRY," It’s a list of excuses, it’s for that guy, Horneck, who’s at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I don’t have to see him.  I need it.  What are you doing?",4
839,ELAINE, I got some for you.,4
840,JERRY, I don’t need any more.,4
841,ELAINE," No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen",4
842,JERRY,  Very funny.,4
843,ELAINE, How about,4
844,JERRY," I’m Dan. Can I have my list back, please?",4
845,ELAINE," Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe you’re doing this. This is absolutely infantile.",4
846,JERRY, What can I do?,4
847,ELAINE, Deal with it. Be a man!,4
848,JERRY, Oh no. That’s impossible. I’d rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.,4
849,ELAINE, You made a man cry? I’ve never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didn’t cry. I got the cab.,4
850,JERRY, Couple of tough monkeys.,4
851,KRAMER," Oh, hi Elaine, hey.  Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!",4
852,JERRY, Game?,4
853,KRAMER, Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!,4
854,JERRY, Wait. How does Horneck know you?,4
855,KRAMER," Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. He’s really into my pizza place idea!",4
856,JERRY, This is too much.,4
857,ELAINE," Wait, what pizza place idea?",4
858,JERRY," Oh, no.",4
859,KRAMER, You get to make your own pie!,4
860,ELAINE," Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.",4
861,KRAMER, Yea.,4
862,KRAMER, Yeah.,4
863,JERRY, Perfect.,4
864,KRAMER," Okay, who wants meatloaf?",4
865,KRAMER,  It’s gonna be hot in a minute.,4
866,JERRY," Oh, we finished early.",4
867,JERRY," Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.",4
868,ELAINE, Hi.,4
869,JERRY, We’re still friends.,4
870,ELAINE," Oh, no no. Tuesday’s uh no good becasue we’ve got choir practice.",4
871,JERRY, Right. I forgot about choir.,4
872,ELAINE, We-We’re doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.,4
873,JERRY," Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.",4
874,ELAINE, Huh... Thursday is no good because we’ve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.,4
875,JERRY, You really should.,4
876,JERRY," You know, I really... I’ve come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that they’re just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you don’t really wanna see them. You don’t call them, they call you. You don’t call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you don’t really have anything in common with is to pretend you’re hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend there’s a little desk around you. The only problem with this is there’s no way you can say, “Hey, it’s been great having you on the show. We’re out of time.”",4
877,JERRY," Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because money’s a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you don’t care about money when you’re hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, you’re like the ruler of an empire. “More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives.” Then after the meal, you know, you’ve got the pants open, you’ve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. They’re mystified by the check. “What is this? How could this be?” They start passing it around the table, “Does this look right to you? We’re not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?”",5
878,JERRY, I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.,5
879,GEORGE, I never heard him say anything really funny.,5
880,JERRY," But it’s common sense. He’s got super strength, super speed. I’m sure he’s got super humor.",5
881,GEORGE," You would think that, but either you’re born with a sense of humor, or you’re not. It’s not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.",5
882,JERRY, Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?,5
883,GEORGE, I don’t know. But he ain’t funny.,5
884,ELAINE," I know, I know. I’m sorry I’m late.",5
885,JERRY, No problem.,5
886,ELAINE, I dropped a grape.,5
887,GEORGE, Pardon?,5
888,ELAINE," I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldn’t find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.",5
889,JERRY," Were you crying? I mean, it’s just a grape. You’ll find it.",5
890,ELAINE," No, I’m just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I’m going out with...",5
891,JERRY, Robert.,5
892,ELAINE," Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and I’m allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I can’t even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actor’s studio so we can’t go there. It’s really causing a lot of problems, you know. He won’t even go away for the weekend because of these cats.",5
893,GEORGE, Guys with cats... I don’t know.,5
894,JERRY," I’ve been thinking about asking this girl I’m, uh, seeing-",5
895,ELAINE, Vanessa.,5
896,JERRY," Vanessa, thank you. I’ve been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.",5
897,GEORGE," Oh, no. No no no no no. I’d have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Let’s see, you’re going to be with her seventy-two hours. That’s a dating decathlon.",5
898,ELAINE,"  Hey, why don’t you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. She’ll love it.",5
899,GEORGE," That’s exquisite. Listen, uh, if it’s not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?",5
900,JERRY," You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.",5
901,GEORGE, Up again?! This is incredible! I’m.. I’m getting it.,5
902,ELAINE, You’re getting what?,5
903,GEORGE, A stock.,5
904,JERRY, What stock?,5
905,GEORGE," Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?",5
906,JERRY, Maybe.,5
907,GEORGE," He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now he’s got some new thing. You know, there’s supposed to be a big merger. He wasn’t even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.",5
908,JERRY, How high’s it suppose to go?,5
909,GEORGE," I don’t know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?",5
910,JERRY, Boy... I don’t know.,5
911,ELAINE, I’d do it but I don’t have any money.,5
912,JERRY, What kind of company is it?,5
913,GEORGE, It’s called Sendrax. They’ve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.,5
914,ELAINE, Televising opera?,5
915,GEORGE, Some sort of electronic thingy.,5
916,JERRY," Well, how much are you going to invest?",5
917,GEORGE, Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand.,5
918,JERRY, Boy...,5
919,GEORGE, C’mon. Wilkinson’s got millions invested in this stock. It’s gone up three points since I’ve been watching it.,5
920,JERRY, What if I lose it?,5
921,GEORGE," C’mon, go for twenty-five hundred. We’ll do it together. Come on, come on. We’re in it together.",5
922,JERRY, All right. Twenty-five hundred.,5
923,GEORGE, That’s it.,5
924,GEORGE,  Check the raiser.,5
925,JERRY, My bet? All right. I’ll open with a tuna sandwich.,5
926,ELAINE, Tuna?,5
927,JERRY," Oh, the dolphin thing?",5
928,ELAINE, They’re dying in the nets.,5
929,JERRY," Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.",5
930,ELAINE," Jerry, can’t you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?",5
931,JERRY," Hey, when I’m driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. I’m always waving everybody in. “Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.” ...All right. All right. I’ll have a chicken salad.",5
932,ELAINE, And I’m going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.,5
933,GEORGE, I’ll have the tuna.,5
934,JERRY," I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.",5
935,JERRY," What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn.  Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll.  I mean, beyond that, I’m risking a punch in the mouth.  Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?",5
936,JERRY," You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.",5
937,JERRY, It’s great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It’s like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish  three days.,5
938,JERRY," Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.",5
939,JERRY," Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?",5
940,JERRY," Oh, big fighting marlin. ",5
941,JERRY, Is that my paper?,5
942,KRAMER," Bad news, my friend.",5
943,JERRY, What? What news?,5
944,JERRY," Oh, c’mon! It’s down again?!",5
945,KRAMER, Two and a half points.,5
946,JERRY," Oh, I can’t believe it. Let me see that.  That’s four and a half points in three days! That’s almost half my money!",5
947,KRAMER," Hey, I told you.",5
948,JERRY,"  Yeah, you told me.",5
949,KRAMER, It’s all manipulated with junk bonds. You can’t win.,5
950,JERRY," There’s one thing I don’t understand. Why does it please you?  George Costanza, please.",5
951,KRAMER," Hey, I don’t care. I’m just telling you to  get rid of that stock, now!",5
952,JERRY,"  George, what’s going on?!",5
953,KRAMER," Sell it, just say I’m selling!",5
954,JERRY,"  Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my money’s gone... Well, call me right back.  Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasn’t been home or in his office in the past three days!",5
955,KRAMER," You know, I can’t believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you could’ve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.",5
956,JERRY, Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?,5
957,KRAMER," Okay, you’re in a restaurant. You’ve got a very big meeting coming up...",5
958,JERRY, Okay...,5
959,KRAMER,"  Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!",5
960,JERRY,  Oh No!,5
961,KRAMER," You just  tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then you’re gone.",5
962,JERRY, You’re gone all right.,5
963,KRAMER,"  Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...",5
964,JERRY," Yeah, I’m going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.",5
965,KRAMER," Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.",5
966,JERRY, What friends?,5
967,KRAMER," Well, it’s just some people I met at a rock concert.  Do you mind if they use your bed?  ‘Cause they’re really good people, Jerry. I’m telling you. You know, they’re anarchists. They’re.. they’re.. they’re.. huge.",5
968,JERRY," George- What?! You’re kidding... Well, what’s wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, I’ll speak to you later.  Wilkinson, the guy who’s supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, he’s in the hospital.",5
969,JERRY, So you don’t know what’s wrong with him?,5
970,GEORGE, All Simons was able to find out is that he’s in the hospital.,5
971,JERRY," Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?",5
972,GEORGE," Of course he’s been in touch with him. He’s left two messages. He just hasn’t heard back yet, that’s all.",5
973,JERRY," Well, this is it. I’m selling.",5
974,GEORGE, Just give it a little more time.,5
975,JERRY, I never should’ve gotten involved in this. I’m a nervous wreck. I’m not cut out for investing.,5
976,GEORGE," All right, all right. That’s it. I’m gonna go down there.",5
977,JERRY, Where?,5
978,GEORGE, To the hospital.,5
979,JERRY, The hospital?,5
980,GEORGE, I’m going to find out what’s going on. All right?,5
981,JERRY, Are you nuts? You don’t even know the guy.,5
982,GEORGE," So what? I’ll start talking to him, you know, casual, and I’ll work my way around to it.",5
983,JERRY," What if he’s in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do?  “How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson?”  “By the way, what’s happening with Sendrax?”",5
984,GEORGE, Maybe he’s resting.,5
985,JERRY, Who goes to the hospital to rest?,5
986,GEORGE," What are you, a doctor?",5
987,JERRY," Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?",5
988,GEORGE, Today. I’m going today. Just don’t do anything until you hear from me.,5
989,JERRY, All right.,5
990,GEORGE,"  Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.",5
991,JERRY, Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It’s completely shrunk. There’s absolutely no way I can wear it.,5
992,JERRY, What’s the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!,5
993,JERRY, I can’t find the receipt.,5
994,JERRY," Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! It’s a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!",5
995,JERRY," What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I don’t even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. That’s what I want. I want an admission of guilt.",5
996,JERRY, No! Dry-cleaned.,5
997,JERRY, You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!,5
998,JERRY," I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, “Well, it’s ruined.” And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, “It’s not our fault. We’re not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation.” You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? They’re cleaning our clothes, but they’re not getting anything wet. It’s all dry. I know there’s gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that they’re using. There’s no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that  That’s dry cleaning. I don’t think that’s what they’re doing back there. They don’t have eighty guys going, “Come on, hurry up! There’s a lot of shirts today!”",5
999,JERRY, Bless you.,5
1000,ELAINE," Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they’re clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he can’t count to ten, so don’t give me hygiene.",5
1001,ELAINE," I don’t know. I can’t think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?",5
1002,JERRY," Well, it couldn’t be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?",5
1003,ELAINE," What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?",5
1004,JERRY, I’m no cat killer.,5
1005,ELAINE, How about we go over there right now and we shave them?,5
1006,JERRY," I’d really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.",5
1007,ELAINE, He actually went to the hospital?,5
1008,JERRY, Yeah.,5
1009,ELAINE," Oh man, he’s nuts.",5
1010,JERRY," Yeah, he’s nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats.  I know, I know. It’s down again.",5
1011,KRAMER, How much are you down altogether?,5
1012,JERRY, I don’t know.. fifteen hundred dollars.,5
1013,KRAMER, Wow.,5
1014,JERRY," You don’t have to say “Wow.” I know it’s “Wow.”  And there’s that smile again. Well, what is that?  It’s George.",5
1015,KRAMER," Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.",5
1016,JERRY, I really don’t need to look.,5
1017,KRAMER, What a body. Yeeaahh. That’s for me.,5
1018,JERRY," Yeah, and you’re just what she’s looking for too – a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.",5
1019,KRAMER, I’m gonna go down there and try and talk to her.,5
1020,JERRY, What? What? Did you go down there?  Did he tell you what’s gonna happen?  How long were you there?,5
1021,GEORGE, Fifteen seconds.,5
1022,JERRY, You told him you knew Simons?,5
1023,GEORGE," Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, I’m in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I’ll tell you one thing. I don’t know what he’s got. But for a sick guy, he’s very strong.",5
1024,JERRY," Well, that’s it. Look, I’m going to Vermont. I don’t want to think about this. I’m selling.",5
1025,ELAINE," Didn’t work, huh?",5
1026,GEORGE,  Not quite.,5
1027,ELAINE," We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?",5
1028,GEORGE, I’m keeping it. I’m going down with the ship.,5
1029,JERRY, So I know this guy. I’m getting all my sneakers at a discount now.,5
1030,JERRY," Oh yeah, right.",5
1031,JERRY,  Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I’ve still got another day! I’ve got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one.  That’s a nice watch. Do you wind it?,5
1032,JERRY," Well, that’s good.",5
1033,JERRY,"  Well, the drive home should be a delight. I’m speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I don’t care.  That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?",5
1034,JERRY," So, I guess you don’t find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?",5
1035,JERRY," Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?",5
1036,JERRY, We cold play “Sorry!” We cold play “Steal the Old Man’s Bundle.”  Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself.  What kind of perfume is that you’re wearing?,5
1037,JERRY," No, what? What kind is it?",5
1038,JERRY,"  Yeah, that’s normal.  Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?",5
1039,JERRY, I did. I’m just curious. It’s been almost a week. I want to check it out.  Six points?  It’s up six points!,5
1040,JERRY, You did not tell me not to sell.,5
1041,JERRY," Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!",5
1042,JERRY, What?,5
1043,JERRY," No, what? ‘That’s probably why..’",5
1044,JERRY,"  So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...",5
1045,GEORGE,"  Have something else. C’mon, have a little dessert?",5
1046,GEORGE," Elaine, get something! It’s all taken care of.",5
1047,ELAINE, I’m kinda full.,5
1048,GEORGE, So don’t finish it.,5
1049,JERRY,"  She’s full. So, Big Daddy. I’m just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?",5
1050,GEORGE, I don’t like to discuss figures.,5
1051,JERRY, How much?,5
1052,GEORGE," I don’t know, what? Eight thousand. It’s a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.",5
1053,JERRY," So, Wilkinson’s out of the hospital now?",5
1054,ELAINE, Oh god.,5
1055,JERRY, Is that still from the cats?,5
1056,ELAINE," No, I just have a cold.",5
1057,JERRY," So, what ever happened with that?",5
1058,ELAINE, I gave him an ultimatum.,5
1059,GEORGE, He chose the cats?,5
1060,ELAINE, They’re very clean animals.,5
1061,JERRY," I gotta say, that’s pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.",5
1062,ELAINE, Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.,5
1063,GEORGE," I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you can’t get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. You’d get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...",5
1064,ELAINE, Superman can go back in time?,5
1065,JERRY, We went over that.,5
1066,GEORGE," Pst.  Wilkinson’s got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. They’re about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.",5
1067,JERRY, A robot butcher?,5
1068,GEORGE," Shhhhh. If you want to get in, there’s very little time.  Sweetheart..  No, no, no. That ought to cover it.  Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek...  Come on, come on, come on...",5
1069,JERRY," I’m not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. I’ve decided I’ll do the work. I’m gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? ‘Cause you send your money out there – working for you – a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, “What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me.” “Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.”",5
1070,JERRY," I’m always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, “Is this the best lane for me? For my life?” They’re always a little bit ahead of you, “Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there?” “Yeah, come on over here, pal. We’re zoomin’ over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it.” The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday we’ll be going,  “Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. I’m gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.”",6
1071,GEORGE, She can’t kill me right?,6
1072,JERRY," No, of course not.",6
1073,GEORGE, People break up all the time.,6
1074,JERRY, Everyday.,6
1075,GEORGE, It just didn’t work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldn’t.,6
1076,JERRY, You tried.,6
1077,GEORGE," I kept looking at her face. I’d go, “C’mon, love her. Love her!”",6
1078,JERRY, Did you tell her you loved her?,6
1079,GEORGE," Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She’d tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. I’d go, “Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, that’s, that’s something.” But, eventually you have to come back with, “Well, I love you.” You know, you can only hold out for so long.”",6
1080,JERRY, You’re a human being.,6
1081,GEORGE, And I didn’t even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no?  I can’t do that to someone.,6
1082,JERRY, You’re too nice a guy.,6
1083,GEORGE," I am. I’m a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, I’m sitting on the couch, she’s on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, she’s on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldn’t do that. I would’ve insulted her.",6
1084,JERRY, You’re flesh and blood.,6
1085,GEORGE," I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didn’t want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. “This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father...” It’s like I’m in quicksand.",6
1086,JERRY, I told you when I met her.,6
1087,GEORGE, My back is killing me.,6
1088,JERRY," You gotta go to my chiropractor, he’s the best.",6
1089,GEORGE," Oh yeah, everybody’s guy is the best.",6
1090,JERRY, I’m gonna make an appointment for you. We’ll go together.,6
1091,GEORGE," Please. They don’t do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Can’t I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.",6
1092,JERRY, You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!,6
1093,ELAINE, Hi.,6
1094,JERRY, Hi.,6
1095,ELAINE," Hey, what are you doing?",6
1096,GEORGE, I’m letting you in.,6
1097,ELAINE, Oh no. No. I don’t want to sit in the back. I’ll be left out of the conversation.,6
1098,GEORGE," No, you won’t.",6
1099,ELAINE," Yes, I will, George. I’ll have to stick my chin on top of the seat.",6
1100,GEORGE, Okay.,6
1101,ELAINE, Why can’t you sit in the middle?,6
1102,GEORGE," Please, it doesn’t look good. Boy, boy, girl.",6
1103,ELAINE," You’re afraid to sit next to a man. You’re a little homophobic, aren’t ya?",6
1104,GEORGE, Is it that obvious?,6
1105,ELAINE," Hello, Jerry.",6
1106,JERRY, Hello.,6
1107,ELAINE, Did you get a haircut?,6
1108,JERRY," No, shower. So, where are we eating?",6
1109,ELAINE," Tell me if you think this is strange. There’s this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. He’s a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever we’d run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. He’s a nice guy, he’s got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, that’s where this relationship is finally gonna settle",6
1110,GEORGE,"  “You know, I’d go from nods to nothing...”",6
1111,ELAINE," And now, there’s this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, it’s like we really hate each other. It’s based on nothing.",6
1112,JERRY, A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in “The Blob”.,6
1113,GEORGE, I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.,6
1114,ELAINE, Really?,6
1115,GEORGE, Yes.,6
1116,ELAINE, You would do that?,6
1117,GEORGE, If I was a different person.,6
1118,JERRY," Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... I’m sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...",6
1119,KRAMER,  Come on up.,6
1120,JERRY,"  Oh, it’s you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldn’t have had to do this. Now that’s two long distance calls I made to you why can’t you...  Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.",6
1121,KRAMER, Taste this.,6
1122,JERRY," No, I just had a sandwich.",6
1123,KRAMER," No, taste it. Taste it.",6
1124,JERRY, I don’t want cantaloupe now.,6
1125,KRAMER, You’ve never had cantaloupe like this before...,6
1126,JERRY, I only eat cantaloupe at certain times...,6
1127,KRAMER, ...Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.,6
1128,JERRY, ...all right!,6
1129,KRAMER, Uh-huh. It’s good?,6
1130,JERRY, It’s very good.,6
1131,KRAMER," Good, huh?",6
1132,JERRY, Good.,6
1133,KRAMER, I got it at Joe’s.,6
1134,JERRY, Uh-huh.,6
1135,KRAMER, Forty-nine cents a pound. That’s practically half than what you’re paying at the supermarket. I don’t know why you don’t go to Joe’s.,6
1136,JERRY, It’s too far.,6
1137,KRAMER, It’s three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..,6
1138,JERRY," I’m not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll ‘em down below my knee?",6
1139,KRAMER," See, the other thing is, if you don’t like anything, he takes it right back.",6
1140,JERRY, I don’t return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.,6
1141,GEORGE, I’m outta there. I did it! It’s over.,6
1142,JERRY, You did it? What happened?,6
1143,GEORGE, I told her. In the kitchen – which was risky ‘cause it’s near all the knives. I started with the word “Listen.”,6
1144,JERRY, Uh-huh...,6
1145,GEORGE," I said, “Listen Marlene,” and then the next thing I know, I’m in the middle of it. And there’s this voice inside of me going, “You’re doing it! You’re doing it!” And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, “Keep going, keep going. You’re almost out!” It’s like I was making a prison break, you know, and I’m heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. She’s firing at me from the guard tower. “Son of a bang! Son of a boom!” I get to the top of the wall – the front door. I opened it up, I’m one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!",6
1146,JERRY," See, it’s never as bad as you imagine.",6
1147,KRAMER, I liked Marlene. What’s her number?,6
1148,GEORGE," Uh, no, I, I don’t think so.",6
1149,JERRY,  Could you stop that smacking?,6
1150,KRAMER," George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.",6
1151,GEORGE," Oh no, thank you.",6
1152,KRAMER, It’s the best cantaloupe I ever had.,6
1153,GEORGE," No, really. No, no, thanks.",6
1154,KRAMER," Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.",6
1155,JERRY, It’s very good cantaloupe.  So that’s it? You’re out?,6
1156,GEORGE," Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.",6
1157,JERRY," So, go get them.",6
1158,GEORGE," Oh, no no, I can’t go back there. Jerry, it’s so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, I’d be right back where I started from.",6
1159,JERRY, So forget about the books. Did you read them?,6
1160,GEORGE," Well, yeah.",6
1161,JERRY, What do you need them for?,6
1162,GEORGE, I don’t know. They’re books.,6
1163,JERRY, What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like they’re trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?,6
1164,GEORGE, They’re my books.,6
1165,JERRY, So you want me to get the books? Is that it?,6
1166,JERRY, So what’d you do?,6
1167,JERRY," Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.",6
1168,JERRY, No.,6
1169,JERRY, I don’t know how this happened.,6
1170,GEORGE," Jerry, it’s not my fault.",6
1171,JERRY," No, no. It’s not your fault. “Books, books, I need my books.” Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, it’s not like Marlene’s a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, we’ve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling.  And it’s these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if I’m busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and she’s in the middle of a sentence!",6
1172,GEORGE, It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?,6
1173,JERRY,"  Ohh! You know, and sometimes she’ll go,  “Hello, Jerry?” And I’ll go, “Oh, hi Marlene.” And then it’s “Jerry...”",6
1174,GEORGE, What trying to get off the phone?,6
1175,JERRY,"  Ohhhh! You can’t! It’s impossible! There’s no break in the conversation where you can go, “All right then...” You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.",6
1176,GEORGE, Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off!  She is sexy though. Don’t you think?,6
1177,JERRY," Yeah. Yes, she is.",6
1178,GEORGE, Yeah.,6
1179,GEORGE,"  Yeah, doctor. I’m going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, aren’t I?  I better take this. I hate the little room.  “Oh, hello, Doctor.”",6
1180,JERRY," The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. ‘Cause it says “Waiting Room.” There’s no chance of not waiting. ‘Cause they call it the waiting room, they’re gonna use it. They’ve got it. It’s all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and you’ve got your little magazine. You pretend you’re reading it, but you’re really looking at the other people. You know, you’re thinking about about them. Things like, “I wonder what he’s got. As soon as she goes, I’m getting her magazine.” And then, they finally call you and it’s a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. “Well, I guess I’ve been chosen. I’ll see you all later.” You know, so you think you’re going to see the doctor, but you’re not, are you? No. You’re going into the next waiting room – the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You don’t wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You don’t want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, “I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in?” Do they scalp tickets to these things? “I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...”",6
1181,JERRY," So, how was it?",6
1182,GEORGE," I was in there for two minutes. He didn’t do anything. Touch this, feel that – seventy-five bucks!",6
1183,JERRY," Well, it’s a first visit.",6
1184,GEORGE," What’s seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I don’t understand this. I’m only paying half.",6
1185,JERRY, You can’t do that.,6
1186,GEORGE, Why not?,6
1187,JERRY, He’s a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.,6
1188,GEORGE," Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.",6
1189,JERRY," No, I’m fine.",6
1190,JERRY," Yeah, I know.",6
1191,JERRY, Yeah.,6
1192,JERRY,  Good night.,6
1193,KRAMER, Hey.,6
1194,JERRY, Hey.,6
1195,KRAMER," I got it! This time, I got it!",6
1196,KRAMER," Hips! See, it’s all hips.",6
1197,JERRY, Uh-huh.,6
1198,KRAMER, You gotta come through with the hips first.,6
1199,JERRY, That is out there.,6
1200,KRAMER, Joe’s?,6
1201,JERRY," No, supermarket.",6
1202,KRAMER," Well, is it good?",6
1203,JERRY, It’s uh okay.,6
1204,KRAMER, Let me taste it.,6
1205,KRAMER," See, that stinks. You can’t eat that. You should take that back.",6
1206,JERRY, I’m not taking it back.,6
1207,KRAMER," All right, I’ll take it back. I’m going by there.",6
1208,JERRY, I don’t care about it.,6
1209,KRAMER," Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.",6
1210,JERRY, All right. Take it back.,6
1211,KRAMER, Well?,6
1212,JERRY, Marlene.,6
1213,KRAMER,"  Oh. Oh, Marlene...",6
1214,JERRY," Yeah, I took her home one night – we kinda started up a little bit in the car.",6
1215,KRAMER, I thought you were trying to get rid of her?,6
1216,JERRY," I was. But, she’s got me, like, hypnotized.",6
1217,KRAMER, Does George know?,6
1218,JERRY," No, he’d go nuts.",6
1219,KRAMER," Yeah, no kidding.",6
1220,JERRY," I feel terrible.  I mean, I’ve seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can’t go any further, but... She’s just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I can’t breathe. It’s like a drug.",6
1221,KRAMER," Whoa, psychosexual.",6
1222,JERRY, I don’t know how I’m going to tell him.,6
1223,KRAMER," Man, I don’t understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?",6
1224,JERRY," It’s partially you, yeah.",6
1225,KRAMER, You’re his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesn’t even know?,6
1226,JERRY," Well, he can’t kill me, right?",6
1227,KRAMER, You’re a human being.,6
1228,JERRY," I mean, she called me. I haven’t called her. She started it.",6
1229,KRAMER, You’re flesh and blood.,6
1230,JERRY, I’m a nice guy.,6
1231,ELAINE, Hi.,6
1232,JERRY,"  Oh, my little airplane lamp.",6
1233,ELAINE," You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. That’s hard to get used to when you’re in so many other fast ones.",6
1234,JERRY," Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don’t have to be home on time.",6
1235,ELAINE, Unless you’re married to a dictator.,6
1236,JERRY, Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.,6
1237,ELAINE, Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebody’s going to offer me some cantaloupe?,6
1238,KRAMER, Nope. No good.,6
1239,JERRY," Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.",6
1240,KRAMER," Well, I’m taking this back.",6
1241,ELAINE," So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.",6
1242,JERRY, Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?,6
1243,ELAINE, Yes.,6
1244,JERRY, You talked to him?,6
1245,ELAINE," Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, “No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.”",6
1246,JERRY, Right.,6
1247,ELAINE," So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, “Hi, remember me?” And he furrows his brow, as if he’s really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, “You little phony. You know exactly who I am.”",6
1248,JERRY," You said ""you little phony""?",6
1249,ELAINE," I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, “Oh, yeah. You’re Jeanette’s friend. We did meet once.” And I said, “Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?”",6
1250,JERRY, This is amazing.,6
1251,ELAINE," And he says, he says, “Look, I just didn’t want to say hello anymore, All right?” And I said, “Fine. Fine. I didn’t want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that I’m aware of it!”",6
1252,JERRY," You are the Queen of Confrontation. You’re my new hero. In fact, you’ve inspired me. I’m gonna call George about something right now.",6
1253,ELAINE, This cantaloupe stinks.,6
1254,GEORGE,  I don’t care.,6
1255,JERRY, You’re kidding.,6
1256,GEORGE," No, I don’t care.",6
1257,JERRY, You mean that?,6
1258,GEORGE, Absolutely.,6
1259,JERRY, You don’t care?,6
1260,GEORGE, No.,6
1261,JERRY, How could you not care?,6
1262,GEORGE, I don’t know. But I don’t. I’m actually almost happy to hear it.,6
1263,JERRY, I thought you’d be upset.,6
1264,GEORGE," I guess I should be, but I’m not.",6
1265,JERRY, Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?,6
1266,GEORGE, You’re a fine person. You’re a humanitarian. She’s very sexy.,6
1267,JERRY, That voice. That voice. She’s driving me crazy.,6
1268,GEORGE, I know. I know.,6
1269,JERRY," So I can see her tonight, and you don’t care?",6
1270,GEORGE, See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. She’s too crazy for me.,6
1271,JERRY, All right. As long as you’re okay. Because I can’t stop thinking about her.,6
1272,GEORGE, I’m okay. I’m fine. I’m wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.,6
1273,JERRY, Good. And I’ll tell you what... You don’t have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.,6
1274,GEORGE,  You paid that crook?!,6
1275,JERRY, I had to.,6
1276,GEORGE," He didn’t do anything, Jerry. It’s a scam! Who told you to do that?",6
1277,JERRY, It was embarrassing to me.,6
1278,GEORGE," Oh, I was trying to make a point.",6
1279,JERRY, Why don’t you make a point with your own doctor?  What’s wrong?,6
1280,GEORGE,  I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do?  What can happen?!,6
1281,JERRY," So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?",6
1282,JERRY, Really? I thought...,6
1283,JERRY," Gee, I just didn’t expect it from the way you’ve been acting.",6
1284,JERRY, Of course I want to talk about it.,6
1285,JERRY, Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?,6
1286,JERRY, My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?,6
1287,JERRY," I can’t believe this. So what are you saying? You didn’t like my act, so that’s it?",6
1288,JERRY, You’re a cashier!,6
1289,JERRY, You can’t go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.,6
1290,JERRY, I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.,6
1291,JERRY," Women need to like the job of the guy they’re with. If they don’t like the job, they don’t like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. “Well, right now, I’m the regional management supervisor. I’m in development, research, consulting...” Men on the other hand – if they are physically attracted to a woman – are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men don’t really care. Men’ll just go, “Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? You’re just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why don’t you shower up, and we’ll get some burgers and catch a movie.”",6
1292,JERRY," My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didn’t want to move to Florida, but they’re in their sixties, and that’s the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old people’s house with a golf cart, jump out, “Let’s go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it!” I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversation’s so boring. It’s so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, “What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass.” You know. Come back in, there’s broken glass, everybody’s all upset. “No, I’m all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, I’m fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Let’s pick it up right there.”",7
1293,JERRY, Hi.,7
1294,JERRY,  Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!,7
1295,JERRY, We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We’ll be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.,7
1296,JERRY," Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.",7
1297,JERRY," Well, the man’s an individualist – he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what he’s doing.",7
1298,JERRY," First of all, I made plans with Elaine.",7
1299,JERRY," I don’t even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, I’ve met them three times in my life.",7
1300,JERRY," If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He’s always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it’s because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.",7
1301,JERRY, Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.,7
1302,KRAMER," Morty, are you coming in?",7
1303,KRAMER,"  Hey, how’d you do?",7
1304,JERRY, We won. We’re in the finals on Wednesday.,7
1305,KRAMER, Yeah!,7
1306,JERRY,  What is this about?,7
1307,KRAMER, I’m completely changing the configuration of the apartment. You’re not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.,7
1308,JERRY, What are you doing?,7
1309,KRAMER, Levels.,7
1310,JERRY, Levels?,7
1311,KRAMER," Yeah, I’m getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And I’m going to build these different levels, with steps, and it’ll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.",7
1312,JERRY, You drew up plans for this?,7
1313,KRAMER, No no. It’s all in my head.,7
1314,KRAMER," Oh, I’ll be comfortable.",7
1315,JERRY, When do you intend to do this?,7
1316,KRAMER, Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.,7
1317,JERRY, You’re doing this yourself?,7
1318,KRAMER," It’s a simple job. Why, you don’t think I can?",7
1319,JERRY," Oh, no. It’s not that I don’t think you can. I know that you can’t, and I’m positive that you won’t.",7
1320,KRAMER," Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.",7
1321,JERRY," I, don’t see it happening.",7
1322,KRAMER," Well, this time, this time you’re wrong. C’mon. I’ll even bet you.",7
1323,JERRY, Seriously?,7
1324,KRAMER, A big dinner with dessert. But I’ve got till the end of the month.,7
1325,JERRY, I’ll give you a year.,7
1326,KRAMER, No no no. End of the month.,7
1327,JERRY, It’s a bet.,7
1328,JERRY,"  Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?",7
1329,ELAINE," No, no. I’m fine.",7
1330,JERRY," Yeah, Uncle Leo.",7
1331,JERRY, Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?,7
1332,JERRY," Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.",7
1333,JERRY, Mickey Mantle?,7
1334,ELAINE,"  Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas?  These peas are great!",7
1335,JERRY,  These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.,7
1336,ELAINE, Mmm... phenomenal peas.,7
1337,JERRY," Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.",7
1338,ELAINE," Oh uh, I don’t really eat dessert. I’m dieting.",7
1339,JERRY," Yeah, I can’t eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can’t dance.",7
1340,JERRY, Horses? They’re like big riding dogs.,7
1341,ELAINE, What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...,7
1342,JERRY," I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.",7
1343,JERRY," Well, I didn’t uh really mean a pony, per se...",7
1344,JERRY, Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...,7
1345,JERRY," Well, I’m sure you did. Who wouldn’t love a pony? Who wouldn’t love a person that had a pony?",7
1346,JERRY," No, see, we didn’t have ponies. I’m sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..",7
1347,JERRY," I didn’t know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrant’s going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin’ on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesn’t make sense. Am I wrong?",7
1348,JERRY, I’ll drive you to the airport.,7
1349,JERRY, I just hope that whole pony incident didn’t put a damper on the trip.,7
1350,JERRY," Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I’m sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.",7
1351,JERRY, Maybe I will.,7
1352,KRAMER," Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.",7
1353,KRAMER, Need any help with those?,7
1354,KRAMER," Oh, well... I decided I’m not gonna do it.",7
1355,JERRY,  Really? What a shock.,7
1356,JERRY, Take care.,7
1357,JERRY," Bye, Dad. Take it easy.",7
1358,KRAMER," Yeah. So long, Morty.",7
1359,JERRY," So, when do I get my dinner?",7
1360,KRAMER, There’s no dinner. The bet’s off. I’m not gonna do it.,7
1361,JERRY," Yes, I know you’re not gonna do it. That’s why I bet.",7
1362,KRAMER," Ya well, there’s no bet if I’m not doing it.",7
1363,JERRY, That’s the bet! That you’re not doing it!,7
1364,KRAMER," Yeah, well, I could do it. I don’t wanna do it.",7
1365,JERRY, We didn’t bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.,7
1366,KRAMER, And it could be done.,7
1367,JERRY," Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if it’s done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!",7
1368,KRAMER, I don’t want the levels!,7
1369,JERRY," That’s the bet!  Hello?... No- oh, hi...  no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch ‘em.  Ma! Ma! Up here! Don’t get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!",7
1370,JERRY, Uncle Leo.,7
1371,JERRY, I don’t know. He said he’d call back.,7
1372,JERRY, What?,7
1373,JERRY, You don’t think... What? The pony remark?,7
1374,JERRY, You don’t think that I killed her?,7
1375,JERRY, It was just an innocent comment! I didn’t know she had a pony!,7
1376,JERRY, The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke.  That’s probably Uncle Leo.,7
1377,JERRY," Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?",7
1378,JERRY, Ah,7
1379,JERRY, I’ve got the softball game on Wednesday. It’s the championship.,7
1380,JERRY, I didn’t even know the woman.,7
1381,JERRY, I mean I met her three times. I don’t even know her last name.,7
1382,JERRY," I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That’s what I want to know. I mean, it’s the championship, I’m hitting everything.",7
1383,JERRY, I don’t know what to do.,7
1384,JERRY," We don’t understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you can’t stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I don’t see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, let’s make up our mind where we think they’re going.",7
1385,ELAINE, I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What time’s your game?,7
1386,JERRY, Two Forty-Five.,7
1387,ELAINE, And what time’s the funeral?,7
1388,JERRY, Two o’ clock.,7
1389,ELAINE, How long does a funeral take?,7
1390,JERRY," Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.",7
1391,ELAINE, So you can’t do both?,7
1392,JERRY," You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn’t expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.",7
1393,ELAINE, How can you even consider not going?,7
1394,GEORGE," You know, I’ve been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I’ll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How’s it gonna happen? I just don’t see how it could occur.",7
1395,ELAINE," You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I’m actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.",7
1396,GEORGE," They always make me take stock of my life. And how I’ve pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.",7
1397,JERRY," I know, and then you say to yourself, “From this moment on, I’m not gonna waste any more of it.” But then you go, “How? What can I do that’s not wasting it?”",7
1398,ELAINE, Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can’t you have coffee with people?,7
1399,GEORGE," You know, I can’t believe you’re even considering not playing. We need you. You’re hitting everything.",7
1400,ELAINE, He has to go. He may have killed her.,7
1401,JERRY, Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.,7
1402,ELAINE," Oh, yeah, but I didn’t say I hated anyone who had one.",7
1403,GEORGE,  Who’s going to play left field?,7
1404,JERRY, Bender.,7
1405,GEORGE," Bender? He can’t play left. He stinks. I just don’t see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care who’s at their funeral? They don’t even know they’re having a funeral. It’s not like she’s hanging out in the back going, “I can’t believe Jerry didn’t show up.”",7
1406,ELAINE, Maybe she’s there in spirit. How about that?,7
1407,GEORGE," If you’re a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think she’s gonna wanna hang around Drexler’s funeral home on Ocean Parkway?",7
1408,ELAINE," George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.",7
1409,GEORGE, You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It’s not like getting on a bus. One second.  It’s all mental.,7
1410,JERRY, Fifty years they were married. Now he’s moving to Pheonix.,7
1411,ELAINE, Phoenix? What’s happening with his appartment?,7
1412,JERRY," I don’t know. They’ve been in there since, like, World War II. The rent’s three hundred a month.",7
1413,ELAINE," Three hundred a month? Oh, my God.",7
1414,JERRY," Well, the game’s starting just about now.",7
1415,JERRY, I just wanted to say how sorry I was...,7
1416,JERRY, Yeah.,7
1417,JERRY," Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.",7
1418,ELAINE," Oh, me too.",7
1419,ELAINE," So, I understand you’re moving to Phoenix?",7
1420,ELAINE," Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, what’s happening with your apartment?",7
1421,ELAINE," Oh, you can have mine. I’ll ship it out to you.  But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?",7
1422,ELAINE," Dry, wet...  what’s happening with your apartment?",7
1423,ELAINE," I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and I’ll watch it for you and I’ll live there and I’ll make sure that nothing happens to it.",7
1424,ELAINE," Oh, Jeffrey.",7
1425,JERRY, You know Jeffery?,7
1426,JERRY, It’s raining? It’s raining. The game will be postponed. We’ll play tomorrow.,7
1427,GEORGE, Who gets picked off in softball? It’s unheard of.,7
1428,JERRY, It’s never happened to me before.,7
1429,ELAINE," I remember saying to myself, “Why is Jerry so far off the base?”",7
1430,JERRY, I’ll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.,7
1431,GEORGE," And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?",7
1432,JERRY, I thought there were two outs.,7
1433,ELAINE, I couldn’t believe it when I saw you running.  I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.,7
1434,GEORGE,  What about Sharon Besser?,7
1435,JERRY," Oh, well, of course. Nineteen-seventy-three.",7
1436,ELAINE," Makes you wonder, though, doesn’t it?",7
1437,JERRY, Wonder about what?,7
1438,ELAINE, You know...  the spirit world.,7
1439,JERRY, You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?,7
1440,ELAINE, I never saw anyone play like that.,7
1441,JERRY, But I went to the funeral.,7
1442,ELAINE," Yeah, but that doesn’t make up for killin’ her.",7
1443,GEORGE, Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.,7
1444,JERRY, Don’t you think she woulda heard I was there?,7
1445,GEORGE, Not necessarily.,7
1446,JERRY, Who figures and immigrant’s gonna have a pony?,7
1447,JERRY," What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police don’t use them for, you know, crowd control.  “Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, I’m talking to you. Behind the barricades!” So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldn’t it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... “Baltic, that’s two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, that’s it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.”",7
1448,JERRY," I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I can’t stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion won’t even exist. It won’t. I think eventually we’ll all be wearing the same thing. ‘Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where there’s people from the future or another planet, they’re all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, “This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. That’s it.” We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, “That was nice. I could wear that.”",8
1449,ELAINE," The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, they’d put it out in the front.",8
1450,JERRY," Why don’t they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, “Just Back.” All back; No front. You walk in the front, you’re immediately in the back.  Look, Elaine, tie carwash.",8
1451,JERRY,  Her father wrote that.,8
1452,ELAINE, Yeah.,8
1453,ELAINE, I’m not so sure he wants one.,8
1454,ELAINE," Hey, don’t forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight o’clock.",8
1455,JERRY, I guess I’m coming. I mean...,8
1456,ELAINE," What? What, you don’t want to go now?",8
1457,JERRY," No, I’ll go. I’m going.",8
1458,ELAINE," No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven’t seen my father in a while and... you know...",8
1459,JERRY," I’m worried I won’t be able to talk to him. He’s such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.",8
1460,ELAINE," So, that’s why we’re not together anymore.",8
1461,JERRY, What is this?,8
1462,JERRY, This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.,8
1463,ELAINE, Try it on.,8
1464,ELAINE," Wow, this is soft suede.",8
1465,JERRY, This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.,8
1466,JERRY, How much is it?,8
1467,ELAINE,  Oh my God.,8
1468,JERRY, Bad?  Very bad?,8
1469,ELAINE, You have no idea.,8
1470,JERRY, I have some idea.,8
1471,ELAINE, No idea.,8
1472,JERRY, I’ve got a ballpark.,8
1473,ELAINE, There is no park and the team has relocated.,8
1474,JERRY, Let me see that.  That is high.,8
1475,ELAINE," Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.",8
1476,JERRY, What’s with the pink lining and the candy stripes?,8
1477,ELAINE," Well, it’s just a lining. You can always have it changed.",8
1478,JERRY," Should I get it? I hate these moments. I’m hearing the dual voices now, you know, “What about the money?” “What’s money?”",8
1479,JERRY, Hey.,8
1480,KRAMER, Hey. New jacket?,8
1481,JERRY, What do you think?,8
1482,KRAMER, It’s beautiful.,8
1483,JERRY, Is it me?,8
1484,KRAMER, That’s definitely you.,8
1485,JERRY, Really?,8
1486,KRAMER," That’s more you than you’ve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?",8
1487,JERRY, I don’t know. It’s got a pink lining.,8
1488,KRAMER," Oh... So, what did you pay for this?",8
1489,KRAMER, How much?,8
1490,JERRY, What’s the difference?,8
1491,KRAMER," What, you’re not gonna tell me?",8
1492,JERRY, I’d rather not say it out loud. It’s embarrassing.,8
1493,KRAMER, Over three hundred?,8
1494,JERRY," Yes, but let’s just stop it right there.",8
1495,KRAMER, It’s over four hundred?,8
1496,KRAMER, Is it over four hundred?,8
1497,JERRY, Would you?,8
1498,KRAMER," Woah, Nelson!",8
1499,JERRY," I know, I know.",8
1500,KRAMER, What are you gonna do with the leather one?,8
1501,JERRY, I don’t know.,8
1502,KRAMER," Well, are you gonna wear it?",8
1503,JERRY, Maybe.,8
1504,KRAMER, You’re not going to wear this.,8
1505,JERRY, Do you want it?,8
1506,KRAMER," Well, yeah. Okay. I’ll take it. I like the jacket.",8
1507,JERRY," Okay, take it.",8
1508,KRAMER," Heey, good karma for you.  Oh baby.",8
1509,GEORGE,  “Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...”,8
1510,JERRY, What is that song?,8
1511,GEORGE," Oh, it’s from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I can’t get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. I’m singin’ it on elevators, buses. I’m singin’ it in front of clients. It’s taken over my life.",8
1512,JERRY," You know, Schumann went mad from that.",8
1513,GEORGE, Artie Schuman? From Camp Hatchapee?,8
1514,JERRY," No, you idiot.",8
1515,GEORGE," What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin’ me an idiot?",8
1516,JERRY, You don’t know Robert Schumann? The composer?,8
1517,GEORGE," Oh, Schumann. Of course.",8
1518,JERRY, He went crazy from one note. He couldn’t get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.,8
1519,GEORGE," Really?  Well, what if it doesn’t stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Let’s just go, All right? I can’t believe we’re having dinner with Alton Benes.",8
1520,JERRY," I know exactly what’s gonna happen tonight. I’m gonna try and act like I’m not impressed, he’s gonna see right through it.",8
1521,GEORGE," Yeah, he’ll be looking at us like he’s backstage at a puppet show.",8
1522,JERRY, Let me just get my jacket.,8
1523,GEORGE, “Master of the house/Keeper of the inn...”  This is huge! When did this happen?,8
1524,JERRY," Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, it’s with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might’ve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.",8
1525,GEORGE, Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.,8
1526,JERRY, Absolutely.,8
1527,GEORGE, It’s fabulous.,8
1528,JERRY, I know.,8
1529,GEORGE," And I’ll tell you something else, I’m not even going to ask you. I want to know. But I’m not gonna ask. You’ll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this?  Over six? Can’t be seven. Don’t tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what you’re saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I won’t say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine.  I’m walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different.  Oh, ho! All right! I’ll tell you what, if you don’t say anything in the next five seconds, I’ll know it was over a thousand.",8
1530,KRAMER,"  Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?",8
1531,JERRY," Well, what kind of solid?",8
1532,KRAMER, I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it’s double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.,8
1533,JERRY, Birds?,8
1534,KRAMER," Yeah. A friend of mine, he’s a magician. He’s going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.",8
1535,JERRY, So take a cab.,8
1536,KRAMER, They won’t take a cage full of birds.,8
1537,JERRY, I can’t. I’m on my way out. There’s no way I can do it.,8
1538,KRAMER," George, do me a solid? Two minutes.",8
1539,GEORGE," Well, I’m going with him. I’d like to... I’ve never done a ‘solid’ before.",8
1540,KRAMER," All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.",8
1541,JERRY,"  Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.",8
1542,GEORGE,  “Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...”,8
1543,JERRY, Schumann.  Where are they?,8
1544,GEORGE, Maybe he didn’t show up.,8
1545,JERRY," What, you don’t want to do this?",8
1546,GEORGE," I don’t think there’s ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up.  Wait a second, is that him?",8
1547,JERRY," Yeah, I think it is.  Where’s Elaine?",8
1548,GEORGE, I’m nervous.,8
1549,JERRY,  Excuse me. Mister Benes?,8
1550,JERRY," I’m Jerry, Elaine’s friend, and this is George.",8
1551,GEORGE," It’s a great thrill to meet you, Sir.",8
1552,JERRY, Sure.,8
1553,JERRY,  I’ll have a cranberry juice with two limes.,8
1554,GEORGE," And, I’ll have a club soda with no ice.",8
1555,GEORGE, You like ice?,8
1556,GEORGE," I said, do you like ice?",8
1557,GEORGE, Don’t you think you get more without it?,8
1558,JERRY," Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She’s usually pretty punctual. Don’t you find that, George?",8
1559,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. She’s punctual... and uh she’s been late, sometimes.",8
1560,JERRY," Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she’s on time, and... sometimes she’s late.",8
1561,GEORGE, I guess...  today she’s late.,8
1562,JERRY, It appears that way.,8
1563,GEORGE, Yup.,8
1564,JERRY, Yup.,8
1565,GEORGE," I know, I know, that’s what they said.",8
1566,GEORGE," The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.",8
1567,GEORGE," No, of course not. I didn’t-",8
1568,GEORGE,"  Oh, he’s the comedian.",8
1569,JERRY, I’m just a regular person.,8
1570,GEORGE," No, no. He’s just being modest.",8
1571,JERRY, Would you excuse me a minute? I’m gonna go to the bathroom. I’ll be right back.,8
1572,GEORGE, I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.,8
1573,GEORGE," Yea, well, maybe some parts.",8
1574,GEORGE," The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized – I have to make a phone call. I-I can’t believe- Would you-",8
1575,GEORGE, Thank you for leaving me alone with him!,8
1576,JERRY, That was brutal. I can’t go back out there.,8
1577,GEORGE," Well, let’s just leave.",8
1578,JERRY, Elaine’ll kill me.,8
1579,GEORGE, Where is she?,8
1580,JERRY, She’s gotta be here soon.,8
1581,GEORGE," How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and that’s it! I’m leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.",8
1582,JERRY, The waiter was trembling!,8
1583,GEORGE," If she doesn’t show up, we can’t possibly have dinner with him alone.",8
1584,JERRY, How are we gonna get out of it?,8
1585,GEORGE, We’ll say we’re frightened and we have to go home.,8
1586,JERRY," Yeah, that’s good. He’d clunk our heads together like Moe.",8
1587,GEORGE, I don’t know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. He’ll understand that.,8
1588,JERRY," All fathers are intimidating. They’re intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, “To hell with the world, I can make my own people. I’ll eat whatever I want, I’ll wear whatever I want, and I’ll create whoever I want.”",8
1589,GEORGE,  My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.,8
1590,GEORGE, Bone marrow.,8
1591,JERRY," Well, Guatamala...",8
1592,GEORGE," Sure, Guatamala...",8
1593,GEORGE," Come on, let’s go!",8
1594,JERRY, What about Elaine?,8
1595,GEORGE, To hell with Elaine!,8
1596,JERRY, She’ll be furious.,8
1597,GEORGE, We’re dying here!,8
1598,JERRY, That’s her! She’s here!,8
1599,ELAINE, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Where is Dad?,8
1600,GEORGE,  He’s in the bathroom.,8
1601,JERRY,  Where have you been?!,8
1602,ELAINE," Kramer! That... Kramer! I’m just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...",8
1603,JERRY," Oh, you didn’t...",8
1604,ELAINE," Well, he said he’d drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesn’t come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. He’s a city marshal. He’s towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, we’re wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now we’re running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus!  So how’s everything going over here?",8
1605,JERRY, Great.,8
1606,GEORGE, Couldn’t be better.,8
1607,ELAINE, Good. ‘Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.,8
1608,JERRY," Oh, no, no.",8
1609,GEORGE, Get outta here..,8
1610,ELAINE," Man, Kramer! I could kill him!",8
1611,JERRY, I can’t believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.,8
1612,JERRY," Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren’s song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?",8
1613,GEORGE, Where do you come up with this stuff?,8
1614,ELAINE," Oh, hi, Dad.",8
1615,ELAINE, No one.,8
1616,ELAINE, Fine.,8
1617,ELAINE," Yeah, I’m reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.",8
1618,GEORGE,  “Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...”,8
1619,ELAINE, Ohh... it’s snowing. It’s beautiful.,8
1620,JERRY,"  Snow. Snow, that can’t be good for suede, can it?",8
1621,GEORGE, I wouldn’t think so.,8
1622,JERRY," What should I do?  Uh, we’re taking a cab, aren’t we?",8
1623,GEORGE,  Why don’t you just turn it inside out?,8
1624,JERRY, Inside out! Great.,8
1625,JERRY," Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.",8
1626,JERRY," Well, it’s a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.",8
1627,GEORGE," It’s uh, it's only a few blocks.",8
1628,JERRY,  Elaine?,8
1629,ELAINE, Yeah.,8
1630,JERRY, Come on up.,8
1631,KRAMER, Hey.,8
1632,JERRY, Hey.,8
1633,KRAMER, I’ve gotta feed the birds.,8
1634,JERRY, So?,8
1635,KRAMER, You got any of those mini Ritzes?,8
1636,JERRY, I can’t believe I do.,8
1637,KRAMER," Yeah! Well, are you going out?",8
1638,JERRY, Yeah.,8
1639,KRAMER," Hey, where’s your new jacket?  What?  Ohhh. What did you do to it?",8
1640,JERRY, I was out in the snow last night.,8
1641,KRAMER, Don’t you know what that does to suede?,8
1642,JERRY, I have an idea.  We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.,8
1643,ELAINE," Okay.  Hello.  Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.",8
1644,JERRY, Is he still in town?,8
1645,ELAINE," No, he’s driving back to Maryland tonight.",8
1646,KRAMER," So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?",8
1647,JERRY, I don’t know.,8
1648,KRAMER,  Well...,8
1649,ELAINE,"  I didn’t want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.",8
1650,JERRY, Really?,8
1651,KRAMER, You gonna throw this out?,8
1652,JERRY," Well, I can’t wear it.",8
1653,ELAINE," Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.",8
1654,KRAMER,"  Well, if you’re just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.",8
1655,JERRY," Yeah, go ahead, take it.",8
1656,ELAINE, Dad thinks George is gay.,8
1657,JERRY," Oh, because of all the singing?",8
1658,ELAINE," No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.",8
1659,KRAMER," Hey, see, I like it like this.",8
1660,ELAINE," Isn’t that...?  Oh, is this from the snow last night?  Ugh... you know what you should’ve done? You should’ve turned it inside out.",8
1661,JERRY, I’ll try and remember that.,8
1662,KRAMER," Boy, it’s too bad you gave me this one too.",8
1663,JERRY," Yeah, too bad.",8
1664,KRAMER, I’m gonna have to do something about this lining.,8
1665,JERRY," I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I don’t get this. Aren’t cows outside most of the time? I don’t understand it. When it’s raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, “Let us in, we’re all wearin’ leather. Open the door! We’re gonna ruin the whole outfit here!” “Is it suede?” “I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I can’t have this cleaned. It’s all I got!” ",8
1666,JERRY," The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what you’re doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? “We have soda, we have soda, we have soda”, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. It’s a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and you’re watching TV and you’re drinking the exact same product that they’re advertising right there on TV, and it’s like, you know, they’re spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and I’m standing there, “Maybe I’m putting too much ice in mine.”",9
1667,GEORGE,"  So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn’t sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I don’t know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like they’re psychotic or something and I don’t know if I’m supposed to smile back, I don’t know what to do. So I just stood there like – remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? That’s what I looked like.",9
1668,JERRY, So you didn’t ask?,9
1669,GEORGE," No, I froze.",9
1670,JERRY, Counter.,9
1671,GEORGE," Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I’m back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, “So why don’t you call her?” I says, “I can’t.” I couldn’t, I couldn’t do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.",9
1672,JERRY, He said wuss?,9
1673,GEORGE," Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.",9
1674,JERRY, So you called.,9
1675,GEORGE," Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.",9
1676,JERRY, Yeah. Like a farm boy.,9
1677,GEORGE," Right. So I call her up, I tell her it’s me, she gives me an enthusiastic ‘Hi!’",9
1678,JERRY, Wow. The enthusiastic hi. That’s beautiful.,9
1679,GEORGE," Oh, I don’t get the enthusiastic hi, I’m outta there.",9
1680,JERRY," All right, so you’re chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.",9
1681,GEORGE," So, we’re talking, and I don’t like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, “What are you doing Saturday night?”",9
1682,JERRY, And?,9
1683,GEORGE, She bought.,9
1684,JERRY, Great day in the morning.,9
1685,GEORGE, Then I got off the phone right away.,9
1686,JERRY," Sure, it’s like robbing a bank. You don’t loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.",9
1687,GEORGE," It’s amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I can’t remember the last time that happened.",9
1688,GEORGE, I can’t stand doing laundry. That’s why I have forty pairs of underwear.,9
1689,GEORGE," Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.",9
1690,JERRY,"  Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.",9
1691,JERRY," Irish, Scottish, what’s the difference, lassie?",9
1692,GEORGE, Yeah.  We should do this again.,9
1693,GEORGE," Oh, no, thanks. I can’t drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.",9
1694,GEORGE, Okay.,9
1695,GEORGE," Yeah, take it easy.",9
1696,JERRY, You’re welcome.,9
1697,JERRY," Oh, that’s okay.",9
1698,JERRY," Okay... but there’s no cake or anything, if that’s what you’re looking for.",9
1699,GEORGE,  Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!,9
1700,JERRY," I think if one’s going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. It’s common courtesy. I don’t know. That’s just the way I was brought up.",9
1701,JERRY," Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?",9
1702,JERRY," Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I don’t feel comfortable in them.",9
1703,JERRY," Oh, I can’t begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.",9
1704,JERRY, You like that commercial?,9
1705,JERRY," Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?",9
1706,JERRY, What could you possibly like about that?,9
1707,JERRY," Yeah, they’re so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.",9
1708,JERRY," Even if the dialogue did ring true.  Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesn’t that bother you?",9
1709,JERRY, But they’re talking about nothing.,9
1710,JERRY, I know the point.,9
1711,JERRY," I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?",9
1712,JERRY," What’s brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy’ll be like, “I don’t think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life?” And of course the woman’s looking at the guy, thinking, “What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?”",9
1713,JERRY," I’m supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?",9
1714,ELAINE, I once broke up with a guy because he didn’t keep his bathroom clean enough.,9
1715,JERRY, No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?,9
1716,ELAINE," Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there – they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.",9
1717,ELAINE, Hi.,9
1718,JERRY, You’re still thinking about this?,9
1719,GEORGE," She invites me up at twelve o’clock at night, for coffee, and I don’t go up. “No thank you. I don’t want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee.” I said this to her. People this stupid shouldn’t be allowed to live. I can’t imagine what she must think of me.",9
1720,JERRY, She thinks you’re a guy that doesn’t like coffee.,9
1721,GEORGE," She invited me up. Coffee’s not coffee, coffee is sex.",9
1722,ELAINE, Maybe coffee was coffee.,9
1723,GEORGE, Coffee’s coffee in the morning. It’s not coffee at twelve o’clock at night.,9
1724,ELAINE, Well some people drink coffee that late.,9
1725,GEORGE," Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who’re on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, “Keep it up, don’t blow it, you’re doing great.”",9
1726,ELAINE, It’s all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.,9
1727,GEORGE, I can’t call her now. It’s too soon. I’m planning a Wednesday call.,9
1728,ELAINE," Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.",9
1729,GEORGE," Of course you do, but you’re imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, “Oh no, I don’t drink coffee late at night.” If I call her now, she’s gonna think I’m too needy. Women don’t wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy – a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.",9
1730,ELAINE, All she’ll think is that you like her.,9
1731,GEORGE, That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid!,9
1732,ELAINE," Well, she wants you to like her.",9
1733,GEORGE," Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesn’t like me!",9
1734,ELAINE, I don’t know what your parents did to you.,9
1735,KRAMER," Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, you’re up there, you’re on the stage and you go, “Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someone’s in a life-and-death situation, and we’re thinking, “Well, sorry buddy, you should’ve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.”",9
1736,KRAMER, So you gonna use it?,9
1737,KRAMER, It’s funny.,9
1738,ELAINE, It is funny.,9
1739,JERRY, I like to use my own material.,9
1740,KRAMER, That’s as good as anything you do.,9
1741,GEORGE," All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.",9
1742,JERRY, Why do we have to leave?,9
1743,GEORGE," Because I can’t call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, let’s go.",9
1744,ELAINE," Oh, see, this is the problem.",9
1745,JERRY, You’re kicking me out of my house?,9
1746,GEORGE, Yes.,9
1747,ELAINE,  Don’t forget.,9
1748,GEORGE,"  Right, alright.  Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?",9
1749,JERRY, Don’t do the apples. It’s enough already with the apples.,9
1750,GEORGE," Um, hi, it’s George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didn’t come up for coffee. You see, I didn’t realise that coffee didn’t really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. It’s up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The ball’s in your court. So uh, take it easy.",9
1751,JERRY," I’m just gonna get my jacket, I’ll meet you downstairs. What’s the matter, did you call?",9
1752,GEORGE," Got her machine. I’m dead, I’m a dead man. That’s it. I’m dead, I’m a dead man. Dead man.",9
1753,JERRY, What did you say?,9
1754,GEORGE," I don’t know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and there’s nothing I can do. It’s a machine. The little light is blinking right now, “Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot’s on!”",9
1755,JERRY, After one date you try and improvise on her machine?,9
1756,GEORGE, Now I’m in the worst position of all.,9
1757,ELAINE," Y’know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy’s machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasn’t supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guy’s house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.",9
1758,GEORGE, He did that?,9
1759,ELAINE, Yeah.,9
1760,GEORGE, Somebody did that?,9
1761,JERRY, She’ll call you back. You’re overreacting.,9
1762,JERRY, Not once.,9
1763,JERRY," I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.",9
1764,JERRY, Thank you.,9
1765,JERRY," Yes, I’m lactose intolerant.",9
1766,JERRY," I have no patience for lactose. And I won’t stand for it. Um, I’ll be right back.",9
1767,GEORGE," Wait till you hear this!  Whoa, ah, I’m sorry, I didn’t, I had no idea.",9
1768,GEORGE," I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I’ll come back.",9
1769,GEORGE, You sure?,9
1770,GEORGE, Okay.,9
1771,GEORGE," Donna. Oh, you’re the one that likes that commercial!",9
1772,GEORGE,"  No, he, he didn’t actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial – in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. He’s, he’s like a clam. You’re not gonna mention this, to him...",9
1773,JERRY," What?  What did, what did you say?",9
1774,GEORGE," Say? What? Nothing, I...",9
1775,JERRY," Well, so what if I said that?",9
1776,JERRY," No, I had to tell my friends – my friends didn’t have to tell you.",9
1777,GEORGE,  Why did you have to get me in trouble?,9
1778,GEORGE, Boy oh boy.,9
1779,JERRY, I said I couldn’t believe you liked that commercial. So what?,9
1780,JERRY," Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.",9
1781,KRAMER, Hey.,9
1782,JERRY," Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.",9
1783,KRAMER, Oh. Cotton Dockers!,9
1784,GEORGE," Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...",9
1785,KRAMER, What? Where are we going?,9
1786,GEORGE, Come on!,9
1787,JERRY," Donna, really, you’re making too much of this.",9
1788,KRAMER," “One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If they’re not Dockers, they’re just pants”",9
1789,JERRY," Please, Donna...",9
1790,GEORGE," I can’t believe I said that. You know me, I’m a vault.",9
1791,JERRY," Don’t worry about it, it wasn’t working anyway.",9
1792,KRAMER, What happened there?,9
1793,JERRY, I’ll tell you later.,9
1794,GEORGE, You are not gonna believe what’s going on with this woman.,9
1795,GEORGE," Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesn’t call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, “I know you’re there, I don’t know what your story is.” Yesterday, I’m a volcano – I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, “Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you don’t call me back for four days? I don’t like coffee, I don’t have to come up. I’d like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.”",9
1796,JERRY, You said that?,9
1797,GEORGE, I lost it.,9
1798,JERRY, I can’t blame you. I can’t believe she never called you back.,9
1799,GEORGE, She did. Today.,9
1800,JERRY, What?,9
1801,GEORGE," She called my office. She said she’s been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didn’t know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and she’s been using her old machine and she doesn’t have the beeper for it.",9
1802,JERRY, So she didn’t get the messages.,9
1803,GEORGE," Exactly, but they’re on there – waiting. She said she can’t wait to see me, we’re having dinner tonight. She’s supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.",9
1804,JERRY, But what about the messages?,9
1805,JERRY, Elaine’s thing? How you gonna get in?,9
1806,GEORGE, I’ll meet her outside the building.,9
1807,JERRY, But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she’s going right for that machine.,9
1808,GEORGE," Unless she goes for the bathroom. That’s my only chance.  Who am I kidding? I can’t do this, I can’t do this. I don’t even know how to work those stupid machines.",9
1809,JERRY," There’s nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.",9
1810,GEORGE, You do it for me.,9
1811,JERRY, What?,9
1812,GEORGE," Come on, it’ll be so much easier.",9
1813,JERRY, How you gonna get me up there?,9
1814,GEORGE," I’ll tell her I bumped into you, I’m giving you a ride uptown.",9
1815,JERRY, And who makes the switch?,9
1816,GEORGE, You do.,9
1817,JERRY, I do.,9
1818,JERRY, I can’t get involved in this.,9
1819,GEORGE, I think I may be in love with this woman.,9
1820,JERRY, What if she sees me?,9
1821,GEORGE," Oh, you are such a wuss.",9
1822,JERRY, A wuss?,9
1823,GEORGE, Yeah.,9
1824,JERRY, Did you call me a wuss?,9
1825,GEORGE, Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.,9
1826,JERRY," I got one problem. You’re keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that she’s coming.",9
1827,GEORGE," A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, I’ll call out tippy-toe!",9
1828,JERRY, Tippy Toe? I don’t think so.,9
1829,GEORGE, You don’t like tippy toe?,9
1830,JERRY, No tippy toe.,9
1831,GEORGE," All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, I’ll sing.",9
1832,JERRY, What song?,9
1833,GEORGE, “How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?”,9
1834,JERRY, What is that?,9
1835,GEORGE," Oh, it’s a lovely song.  “How do you solve a problem like Maria?...”",9
1836,JERRY, Anything else?,9
1837,GEORGE, You pick it.,9
1838,JERRY, “Lemon Tree.”,9
1839,GEORGE," Peter, Paul and Mary.",9
1840,JERRY," No, Trini Lopez.",9
1841,GEORGE, Alright ok. You got the tape?,9
1842,JERRY, Standard. Micro.,9
1843,GEORGE, How do you feel? Confident?,9
1844,JERRY, Feel good.,9
1845,GEORGE, You nervous?,9
1846,JERRY, Not at all.,9
1847,GEORGE," Get up, get up, it’s her! Oh, the hell with this, I’m scared to death, just walk away, it’s off, cancel everything, go!",9
1848,GEORGE," I, I couldn’t wait. I was too anxious to see you.",9
1849,GEORGE," Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isn’t that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.",9
1850,JERRY, All the time.,9
1851,JERRY, Hi.,9
1852,GEORGE," You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.",9
1853,GEORGE, Don’t you wanna go upstairs first?,9
1854,JERRY," You know, I really need to use the bathroom.",9
1855,GEORGE," Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...",9
1856,GEORGE, I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.,9
1857,GEORGE," Right, right.",9
1858,JERRY," Uh, you know, why don’t you go first, you just had a long trip.",9
1859,JERRY," Um, you know, it’s the damnedest thing. It went away.",9
1860,GEORGE," No, no that can happen. I’ve, uh, I’ve read about that in medical journals. It’s a freak thing, but...",9
1861,GEORGE," Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?",9
1862,GEORGE," Please, this is very, very important.",9
1863,GEORGE,"  Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!",9
1864,JERRY, Right. I am.,9
1865,GEORGE," Carol, that’s so rude. Please, I’m serious, just for a moment, if you wouldn’t mind. And then we’ll talk to Jerry.",9
1866,JERRY,  Hey you two. I’m ready to go.,9
1867,GEORGE,  Don’t you find that strange?,9
1868,JERRY, Yes.,9
1869,GEORGE," Oh, uh...",9
1870,JERRY," I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didn’t want to talk to, I could go, “Excuse me, I’m not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away.” I also have a cordless phone, but I don’t like that as much, because you can’t slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone – “You can’t talk to me like that!” Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone – “You can’t talk to me like that!”													 “I told him!”",9
1871,JERRY," Well, I painted my apartment again. I’ve been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, it’s a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize it’s just the thickness of the paint, but I’m aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, it’s closer and closer. I don’t even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. That’s where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... That’s why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. That’s why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.",10
1872,JERRY, What did you do?,10
1873,KRAMER, Mousse. I moussed up.,10
1874,ELAINE, I guess it was just a matter of time.,10
1875,KRAMER," You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?",10
1876,JERRY," Well, looks are so subjective.",10
1877,ELAINE," I don’t mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.",10
1878,KRAMER,"  Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!",10
1879,ELAINE," She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.",10
1880,JERRY, Maybe.,10
1881,JERRY,  Harold and Manny.,10
1882,JERRY," Boys, boys.",10
1883,JERRY," I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?",10
1884,JERRY, She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died?,10
1885,JERRY, Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?,10
1886,JERRY, It’s not promised to anybody? ‘Cause she’d take it in a second.,10
1887,JERRY," So, it’s okay? I could just tell her she can have it?",10
1888,KRAMER," Hey, Harold, what do you think?",10
1889,KRAMER,"  Hey, thanks.",10
1890,ELAINE, What was that all about?,10
1891,JERRY,"  Oh, nothing important.",10
1892,ELAINE, What’s going on? What is that look?,10
1893,JERRY, What look? Nothing.,10
1894,ELAINE, Something’s going on here.,10
1895,JERRY," I don’t know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I can’t decide.",10
1896,ELAINE, Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? C’mon. Cough it up.,10
1897,JERRY," Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am – rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...",10
1898,ELAINE, Would you please?,10
1899,JERRY, What would you say if I told you that...,10
1900,ELAINE, Told me what?!,10
1901,JERRY, ...I got you an apartment in this building.,10
1902,ELAINE,  No.,10
1903,JERRY, Yes.,10
1904,ELAINE, No.,10
1905,JERRY, Yes.,10
1906,ELAINE, You didn’t.,10
1907,JERRY, I did.,10
1908,ELAINE, You got me an apartment in the building?!,10
1909,JERRY, I got you an apartment in the building.,10
1910,ELAINE, How did you...,10
1911,JERRY, Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?,10
1912,ELAINE, No.,10
1913,JERRY, She died.,10
1914,ELAINE,  She died?!,10
1915,JERRY, She died.,10
1916,ELAINE, She died!,10
1917,JERRY, And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!,10
1918,ELAINE, Get out!,10
1919,ELAINE, Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!,10
1920,JERRY, Four hundred a month.,10
1921,ELAINE, And I’ll be right upstairs?,10
1922,JERRY, Right upstairs.,10
1923,ELAINE, Right above you?,10
1924,JERRY, Right above me.,10
1925,ELAINE," Oh, we’re neighbors. I’ll be here all the time!",10
1926,JERRY, All the time.,10
1927,ELAINE,"  We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!",10
1928,JERRY, All the time.,10
1929,JERRY," The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like you’re always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. You’re out somewhere with people, “Gee, you look pregnant.. are you?” “Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, that’s not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Let’s take this whole scene again. People, think about what you’re saying!”",10
1930,GEORGE," Thanks, see you later, Donna.",10
1931,GEORGE, What happened to you?,10
1932,JERRY, You can’t believe what I just did.,10
1933,GEORGE, What? What did you do?,10
1934,JERRY," I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn’t believe it. It’s not believable.",10
1935,GEORGE, What did you do?,10
1936,JERRY, How could I have done that?,10
1937,GEORGE, Done what?,10
1938,JERRY, I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. She’s going to move in.,10
1939,GEORGE, Elaine’s moving into your building?,10
1940,JERRY, Yes. Right above me.,10
1941,GEORGE, Right above you?,10
1942,JERRY, Yeah.,10
1943,GEORGE, You’re gonna be neighbors.,10
1944,JERRY, I know. Neighbors.,10
1945,GEORGE, She’s right above you?,10
1946,JERRY, Right above me.,10
1947,GEORGE, How could you do that?,10
1948,JERRY," ‘Cause I’m an idiot! You may think you’re an idiot, but with all due respect, I’m a much bigger idiot than you are.",10
1949,GEORGE," Don’t insult me, my friend. Remember who you’re talking to. No one’s a bigger idiot than me.",10
1950,JERRY, Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?,10
1951,GEORGE, Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Pocono’s?,10
1952,JERRY," She’s right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, I’m gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.",10
1953,GEORGE, You’re doomed. You’re gonna have to have all your sex at women’s apartments. It’ll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.,10
1954,JERRY, But I need the home bed advantage.,10
1955,GEORGE, Of course. We all do.,10
1956,JERRY, Come in for two minutes and sit with me.,10
1957,GEORGE, I was just in there. It’s embarrassing.,10
1958,JERRY," Oh, who’s gonna know?",10
1959,GEORGE, They saw me walk out.,10
1960,JERRY, Two minutes.,10
1961,JERRY, My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don’t make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.,10
1962,GEORGE, My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.,10
1963,JERRY," So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?",10
1964,GEORGE, Tough.,10
1965,JERRY," You know, the water pressure’s terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.",10
1966,GEORGE, I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.,10
1967,JERRY," If they were fanatic about showers, they might.",10
1968,GEORGE," For that rent, she’d take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.",10
1969,JERRY," Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn’t that child abuse?",10
1970,GEORGE," I’d like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?",10
1971,JERRY," Yeah, the guy with the flat head.",10
1972,GEORGE," He’s a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since he’s been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.",10
1973,JERRY," Yeah, I’ve heard that about wedding bands.",10
1974,GEORGE, I wonder if that’s really true.,10
1975,JERRY," That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his father’s band. He’d loan it to you.",10
1976,GEORGE, Thanks a lot. I’ll give it back to you in a week.,10
1977,KRAMER," You know, I don’t even know why you’re fooling around with this ring. I’ve been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.",10
1978,GEORGE, I’m not doing that.,10
1979,KRAMER," Oh, man. You know, you’re crazy. You’re a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?",10
1980,GEORGE," No, I’ll put half a can of mousse in my head like you.",10
1981,JERRY," Boys, boys.",10
1982,JERRY, What?,10
1983,JERRY," Hey, hey. I understand. You’re businessmen.",10
1984,JERRY," Well, that’s a lot of money. But, if that’s the way it’s gotta be, that’s the way it’s gotta be.",10
1985,JERRY," You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.",10
1986,GEORGE, What happened to you?,10
1987,JERRY," Religion, my friend, that’s what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that it’s going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.",10
1988,GEORGE,  Five thousand dollars? She doesn’t have five thousand dollars!,10
1989,JERRY, Of course she doesn’t have five thousand dollars!,10
1990,GEORGE," So, she can’t get the apartment.",10
1991,JERRY, Can’t get it.,10
1992,GEORGE," So, she doesn’t move in.",10
1993,JERRY," No move. So, you see, it’s all part of a divine plan.",10
1994,GEORGE, And how does the baldness fit into that plan?,10
1995,JERRY,  Elaine?,10
1996,ELAINE, Yeah.,10
1997,JERRY,"  All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend I’m disappointed. You’re going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.",10
1998,GEORGE, Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!,10
1999,JERRY," ‘Cause you know, I love Elaine.",10
2000,GEORGE, Of course you do.,10
2001,JERRY," But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.",10
2002,ELAINE,"  No, I’ll be seeing you.  ""Good morning, good morning..”  Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt it’s great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?",10
2003,ELAINE," Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last month’s security deposit.  I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.",10
2004,JERRY, Well... there’s a little bit of a problem.,10
2005,ELAINE," Oh, I know. There’s a weak shower spray, I know. I’ve already thought about it, and I’m switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, “Why stand when you can sit?” Maybe I’ll get some rubber duckies.",10
2006,JERRY," Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. I’m sure they’d just as soon give it to you, but you’d have to come up with that money.",10
2007,ELAINE, Five thousand dollars? I don’t have five thousand dollars.,10
2008,JERRY, I know.,10
2009,ELAINE,  How am I going to get five thousand dollars?,10
2010,JERRY, I have no idea.,10
2011,KRAMER,"  Hey, my new neighbor!",10
2012,ELAINE, I’m not moving in.,10
2013,KRAMER, What?,10
2014,ELAINE, They want five thousand dollars now.,10
2015,KRAMER," So, okay uh what’s the problem?",10
2016,ELAINE, I don’t have five thousand dollars.,10
2017,KRAMER," C’mon, you can come up with five thousand dollars.  Jerry, you don’t have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.",10
2018,JERRY," Yeah, well, I didn’t- Is that something you want to borrow?",10
2019,ELAINE," No, that’s too much money to borrow.",10
2020,KRAMER, Loan her the money. You can afford it.,10
2021,JERRY, She doesn’t wanna borrow the money.,10
2022,KRAMER," Oh, c’mon. She’ll pay you back. What’s five grand between friends?",10
2023,ELAINE, Of course I’d pay you back..,10
2024,KRAMER," Yeah, so what’s the problem?",10
2025,JERRY, Who said there’s a problem?,10
2026,KRAMER, Hey see He said he’d loan you the money.,10
2027,ELAINE," Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?",10
2028,KRAMER, That’s okay. He doesn’t care.,10
2029,ELAINE," Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.",10
2030,KRAMER, Get outta here.,10
2031,ELAINE, Let me think about it.,10
2032,KRAMER, What’s to think about?,10
2033,ELAINE, I don’t know... I don’t know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.,10
2034,JERRY,"  It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Where’s she gonna get five thousand? She doesn’t have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. She’s gone. Then you come in, “Why don’t you loan her five thousand? What do you care? You’ve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!”",10
2035,KRAMER, You didn’t want her in the building?,10
2036,JERRY," No, I didn’t!",10
2037,KRAMER," Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she won’t take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.",10
2038,JERRY, People don’t turn down money. It’s what separates us from the animals.,10
2039,KRAMER, I still don’t understand what the problem is having her in the building.,10
2040,JERRY," Let me explain something to you. You see, you’re not normal. You’re a great guy, I love you, but you’re a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldn’t understand.",10
2041,KRAMER, Because I’m a pod?,10
2042,ELAINE, I’ll take it!,10
2043,ELAINE," Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry.",10
2044,JERRY, Hi,10
2045,ELAINE, Jerry’s the one who got me my new apartment.,10
2046,JERRY," Yes, it’s my life’s work.",10
2047,GEORGE," Yeah, my wife couldn’t make it today. She’s got something with her mother... Who knows what’s going on with her. Don’t let any one kid you, it’s tough.",10
2048,JERRY," Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.",10
2049,JERRY," Oh, yes. Particularly if you’re not in it.",10
2050,JERRY," What’s to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.",10
2051,GEORGE," ...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. I’m tellin’ you, it’s one thing after another.",10
2052,GEORGE," Uh no no, she’s working.",10
2053,GEORGE," She’s an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?",10
2054,GEORGE,  But..,10
2055,ELAINE," Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. They’re in my short story class with Roxanne and me.",10
2056,JERRY, Hi how are ya?,10
2057,ELAINE," Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!",10
2058,JERRY,  Fantastic.,10
2059,JERRY, I know.,10
2060,JERRY, It’s tremendous.,10
2061,JERRY, I’m in heaven.,10
2062,ELAINE," Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. He’s the one who got me the apartment.",10
2063,GEORGE," I’m sorry, I don’t see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, what’s so hard?",10
2064,GEORGE,  You’d have to be a real loser to try something like that.,10
2065,ELAINE,"  So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?",10
2066,JERRY," Oh, I wouldn’t quite say that.",10
2067,ELAINE," Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.",10
2068,JERRY, I’m a guy – it always looks like that.,10
2069,ELAINE," Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, y’know... cramp our styles?",10
2070,JERRY, Nah...,10
2071,ELAINE," Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as you’re okay with it, it’s fine with me.",10
2072,GEORGE," Umm, I’m not. It’s just a sociological experiment!",10
2073,JERRY, You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didn’t take it.  This is an idiot.,10
2074,GEORGE," Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza",10
2075,GEORGE," But suddenly, a new contender has emerged...",10
2076,JERRY," George, I didn’t sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. I’m just going to be honest. That’s all... Yes, I’m nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. It’ll slide right off... Then try axle grease...  I’ll call you back after I talk to her... Bye.",10
2077,KRAMER," Well, it’s all taken care of. Everything’s cool.",10
2078,JERRY, What? What’s cool?,10
2079,KRAMER, Elaine.,10
2080,JERRY, What are you talking about?,10
2081,KRAMER, I just found a guy who’s willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.,10
2082,JERRY, You what?! Get out!  Ten thousand?,10
2083,KRAMER, Cash.,10
2084,JERRY, Who would pay that much?,10
2085,KRAMER, He’s in the music business.,10
2086,JERRY," Elaine would never borrow that much money!  Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think I’m in the clear here. Elaine’s not moving in. I don’t have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. I’m golden!",10
2087,KRAMER," Well, occasionally I like to help the humans.",10
2088,ELAINE, Wow. You’re right. That is loud.,10
2089,JERRY, It’s just unbelievable.,10
2090,ELAINE, They rehearse all the time?,10
2091,JERRY, All the time. I’ve been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I can’t live like this. I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I’m heading for breakdown!  Can’t you do something?,10
2092,JERRY, Manny...,10
2093,ELAINE," Boy, too bad. If I was up there, you’d never hear a peep out of me. I’m as quiet as a mouse.",10
2094,KRAMER," Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! ",10
2095,JERRY," I don’t know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three o’clock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someone’s door and tell them to keep it down? You’re really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? What’s happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. There’s a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. “Shh... shh... shhh... shhh...” Doesn’t work, ‘cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. “Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me.” Some people you can’t shush in a movie theater. There’s always that certain group of people, isn’t it? They’re talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They won’t shush. They’re the unshushables.",10
2096,JERRY,"  Oh, Hi. A hundred episodes,  that's a lot. During the course of which George, Elaine, Kramer and I have had many experiences both positive and negative. Well mostly negative, there have been some relationships that haven't worked out ambitions that were unfulfilled, hopes dashed, some property damage, hurt feels, I know one guy got deported, physical injury an... alright maybe even a death or two.  But we've persevered because we're people... real TV people, and for thirty minutes a week  that's pretty important to us so if you're joining us late  here's some highlights from what's happened so far. ",100
2097,JERRY," Oh, Hi. I didn't realize you'd be back soo soon. You know after a hundred episodes this apartment has really seen a lot of action. George, Kramer,  that girl...  Elaine. But in the end it's really a show about people,  people who really care about each other and I think that says something, I guess, I dunno. Just watch ",100
2098,JERRY, Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.,102
2099,ELAINE, I know. I need a lesson.,102
2100,JERRY, You stink. You know you stink. What is this?,102
2101,ELAINE, Oh. My ballet tickets.,102
2102,JERRY, Oh. Your ballet tickets.,102
2103,ELAINE," Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?",102
2104,JERRY," No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.",102
2105,ELAINE," You know, I'm going as a beard.",102
2106,JERRY, A beard?,102
2107,ELAINE," Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.",102
2108,JERRY, Yes.,102
2109,ELAINE," So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.",102
2110,JERRY, Why are you doing this?,102
2111,ELAINE," Swan Lake, at the Met.",102
2112,KRAMER," Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.",102
2113,ELAINE," Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?",102
2114,JERRY, Yeah.,102
2115,ELAINE, Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?,102
2116,KRAMER, I think he looks fantastic.,102
2117,ELAINE," Oh, come on.",102
2118,KRAMER," No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.",102
2119,GEORGE," Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.",102
2120,ELAINE, You look ridiculous in that thing.,102
2121,GEORGE, Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?,102
2122,ELAINE, Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.,102
2123,GEORGE," Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.",102
2124,KRAMER," You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.",102
2125,JERRY, Well what about me?,102
2126,KRAMER, No I think he's got you beat buddy.,102
2127,GEORGE, So she's gorgeous.,102
2128,KRAMER," Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.",102
2129,GEORGE, Well have you got a picture?,102
2130,KRAMER, No.,102
2131,GEORGE," Well, I have to see her.",102
2132,KRAMER," Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.",102
2133,GEORGE, Really?,102
2134,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.",102
2135,GEORGE, Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?,102
2136,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. I think he will.",102
2137,JERRY, It sounds like an excellent idea.,102
2138,KRAMER," Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.",102
2139,GEORGE, Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.,102
2140,KRAMER, Here you go brother. Some food for you.,102
2141,KRAMER, Now are you going to be here in an hour?,102
2142,KRAMER," Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?",102
2143,KRAMER, Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier.,102
2144,GEORGE, Pouty? I like that.,102
2145,JERRY, You can't go wrong with pouty.,102
2146,GEORGE, I'm excited about the pouty.,102
2147,KRAMER," All right George, come on, take a look.",102
2148,GEORGE," Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.",102
2149,JERRY," Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?",102
2150,GEORGE, Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?,102
2151,JERRY," Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.",102
2152,KRAMER," Hey, man. Enjoy the food?",102
2153,KRAMER," Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now.",102
2154,KRAMER," Woah, woah, that's mine.",102
2155,KRAMER," No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.",102
2156,KRAMER, I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.,102
2157,ELAINE," Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.",102
2158,ELAINE, Yes indeed.,102
2159,ELAINE, Really. Why?,102
2160,ELAINE," Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.",102
2161,ELAINE," Oh, hi honey.",102
2162,ELAINE, Oh it was such a great night.,102
2163,JERRY, And did they suspect anything?,102
2164,ELAINE," No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.",102
2165,JERRY, And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.,102
2166,ELAINE, Oh it was such a great night. Oh.,102
2167,JERRY, You said that already.,102
2168,ELAINE, Oh I did?,102
2169,JERRY, Yeah.,102
2170,ELAINE, Oh.,102
2171,JERRY, Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?,102
2172,ELAINE, He's incredible.,102
2173,JERRY," Yeah, but?",102
2174,ELAINE," Yeah, I know.",102
2175,JERRY, So?,102
2176,ELAINE, What?,102
2177,JERRY, Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?,102
2178,ELAINE, Well it did occur to me.,102
2179,JERRY, You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.,102
2180,ELAINE, Why? Is it irrevocable?,102
2181,JERRY, Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.,102
2182,ELAINE, We've got a good team.,102
2183,JERRY," Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.",102
2184,ELAINE, Why can't he play for us?,102
2185,JERRY, They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.,102
2186,ELAINE, We just got along *so* great.,102
2187,JERRY, Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.,102
2188,ELAINE," No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.",102
2189,JERRY, You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.,102
2190,ELAINE, I realize that.,102
2191,JERRY, Are you that desperate?,102
2192,ELAINE, Yes I am.,102
2193,JERRY," So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.",102
2194,JERRY, What are you looking for?,102
2195,KRAMER, Tupperware.,102
2196,JERRY, Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.,102
2197,KRAMER," I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.",102
2198,JERRY, What about a plastic bag?,102
2199,KRAMER, You must be kidding.,102
2200,JERRY, What is the difference?,102
2201,KRAMER," The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.",102
2202,GEORGE, So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.,102
2203,KRAMER," Oh yeah, you talked to her.",102
2204,GEORGE, Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.,102
2205,KRAMER, Yeah well we go way back.,102
2206,GEORGE, Why didn't anything happen between you two?,102
2207,KRAMER, Who's to say it didn't?,102
2208,JERRY, So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?,102
2209,GEORGE, Yes I did.,102
2210,JERRY, What did you say to her?,102
2211,GEORGE, What do you think I said?,102
2212,JERRY, I don't know.,102
2213,GEORGE, I told her the truth.,102
2214,JERRY, As you see it?,102
2215,GEORGE," Yes, as I see it.",102
2216,JERRY," Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?",102
2217,GEORGE, What hat?,102
2218,JERRY," You know, you're little hair hat there.",102
2219,GEORGE, No.,102
2220,JERRY, Don't you think she could tell?,102
2221,KRAMER," No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.",102
2222,JERRY, Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.,102
2223,GEORGE, You only think that because you know me.,102
2224,JERRY, Have you noticed people staring at your head?,102
2225,GEORGE, I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.,102
2226,JERRY, Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.,102
2227,KRAMER," No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.",102
2228,GEORGE," Look, I guarantee she won't know.",102
2229,KRAMER," Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.",102
2230,JERRY," Oh, I'll split a cab with you.",102
2231,KRAMER, Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.,102
2232,JERRY, Hi Sarge.,102
2233,KRAMER, Sure. I will.,102
2234,GEORGE,"  Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.",102
2235,GEORGE, Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.,102
2236,GEORGE," No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.",102
2237,GEORGE, Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.,102
2238,JERRY, What's that?,102
2239,JERRY," Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?",102
2240,JERRY, Really.,102
2241,JERRY, No.,102
2242,JERRY, I admit it. I don't watch it.,102
2243,JERRY, The poly?,102
2244,ELAINE, Melrose Place?,102
2245,JERRY, Yes. Melrose Place.,102
2246,ELAINE, I just didn't know you watched that.,102
2247,JERRY, Well I do.,102
2248,ELAINE, I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.,102
2249,JERRY, Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.,102
2250,ELAINE, You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...,102
2251,JERRY," And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.",102
2252,ELAINE, Why? Why were you so embarrassed?,102
2253,JERRY, The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.,102
2254,ELAINE, That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?,102
2255,JERRY, It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.,102
2256,ELAINE, So what are you going to do?,102
2257,JERRY, I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.,102
2258,ELAINE," Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?",102
2259,JERRY," Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?",102
2260,ELAINE, Oh god this tastes terrible.,102
2261,JERRY, Did you shake it up?,102
2262,ELAINE, No.,102
2263,JERRY, You gotta shake it up.,102
2264,ELAINE, No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.,102
2265,JERRY," Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.",102
2266,ELAINE," So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.",102
2267,JERRY, So tonight are you going to make the move?,102
2268,ELAINE," Yeah, I think I might.",102
2269,JERRY, Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?,102
2270,GEORGE, That's an interesting question.,102
2271,JERRY, How so?,102
2272,GEORGE, How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!,102
2273,ELAINE, What do you mean bald?,102
2274,GEORGE, What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.,102
2275,JERRY, She's bald?,102
2276,GEORGE, She's bald.,102
2277,ELAINE, Oh come on.,102
2278,GEORGE, Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was  hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.,102
2279,ELAINE, Well maybe she got a haircut or something.,102
2280,GEORGE," Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says ""Give me the Larry Fine.""",102
2281,JERRY, Women go bald?,102
2282,ELAINE," Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.",102
2283,JERRY, Hey.,102
2284,KRAMER, Hey.,102
2285,GEORGE, You fixed me up with a bald woman.,102
2286,KRAMER, Bald?,102
2287,GEORGE," Yeah, that's right.",102
2288,ELAINE, Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.,102
2289,GEORGE, So?,102
2290,ELAINE,  You're bald!,102
2291,GEORGE, No I'm not. I *was* bald.,102
2292,GEORGE, Elaine.,102
2293,GEORGE," No, no, no Elaine.",102
2294,ELAINE,  I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.,102
2295,GEORGE, Nooooo.,102
2296,ELAINE, Well I figured that's what couples do.,102
2297,ELAINE, Well it was easy. Really.,102
2298,ELAINE," Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?",102
2299,ELAINE, Yeah. Upstairs?,102
2300,ELAINE," I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?",102
2301,ELAINE, Have you ever thought about it?,102
2302,ELAINE," Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*.",102
2303,GEORGE," I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.",102
2304,JERRY, Good to have you back.,102
2305,GEORGE, And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.,102
2306,JERRY, She's as good as anybody else.,102
2307,GEORGE, Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.,102
2308,JERRY, Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.,102
2309,GEORGE, Going to need a little more coffee here.,102
2310,JERRY," So George, how do I beat this lie detector?",102
2311,GEORGE," I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.",102
2312,JERRY," Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.",102
2313,GEORGE," Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, ""Teach me to sing like you.""",102
2314,JERRY," All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.",102
2315,GEORGE," Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.",102
2316,ELAINE," Hey, I did it.",102
2317,JERRY, What?,102
2318,ELAINE, I turned him. He defected.,102
2319,JERRY, Get out!  How? How did you do that?,102
2320,ELAINE, Because I'm a *woman*.  Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.,102
2321,JERRY," Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said ""Too bad he's gay"".",102
2322,ELAINE," Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.",102
2323,JERRY, Jerry Seinfeld.,102
2324,JERRY, 129 West 81st street.,102
2325,JERRY, I don't know.,102
2326,JERRY, I don't know.,102
2327,JERRY, I don't know.,102
2328,JERRY,"  Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.",102
2329,JERRY, He went back? What do you mean he went back?,102
2330,ELAINE, He went back.,102
2331,JERRY," I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.",102
2332,ELAINE," Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.",102
2333,JERRY, You can't. That's why they lose very few players.,102
2334,ELAINE," Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.",102
2335,JERRY," Well there's always a place for you, on our team.",102
2336,ELAINE, Yeah.  Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?,102
2337,JERRY, Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.,102
2338,ELAINE, Okay.,102
2339,JERRY, Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.,102
2340,ELAINE," Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.",102
2341,GEORGE, Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.,102
2342,ELAINE, What is the matter?,102
2343,GEORGE," I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.",102
2344,KRAMER, Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?,102
2345,ELAINE," I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.",102
2346,JERRY," All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.",102
2347,JERRY," Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.",102
2348,KRAMER," Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.",102
2349,KRAMER, Me?,102
2350,JERRY,"Now, I was thinking the other day about hair, and that the weird Thing about it, is that people will touch other people's hair. You will actually kiss another human being, right on the head. But, if one of those hairs should somehow be able to get out of that skull, and go off on its own, it is now the vilest, most disgusting thing that you can encounter. The same hair. People freak out.  ""There was a hair, in the egg salad!""",103
2351,GEORGE, Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?,103
2352,JERRY, I would think.,103
2353,GEORGE," So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?",103
2354,JERRY,  You don't flamenco on the first date.,103
2355,GEORGE," Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.",103
2356,JERRY, Yeah? Would you do it?,103
2357,GEORGE," Yes, I think I would.",103
2358,JERRY," Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.",103
2359,JERRY," Hello.  Oh, hi Nana.  What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it.  Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.",103
2360,JERRY, I have to go over to my grandmother's.,103
2361,GEORGE, What for?,103
2362,JERRY, I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.,103
2363,GEORGE," So, what, no lunch?",103
2364,JERRY," No, we have time.",103
2365,GEORGE, Oh. How's she doing?,103
2366,JERRY," Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.",103
2367,GEORGE," Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.",103
2368,JERRY, Like toothpaste?,103
2369,GEORGE, Ya-hah.,103
2370,JERRY, There's a squeeze ketchup.,103
2371,GEORGE, I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.,103
2372,JERRY," Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?",103
2373,GEORGE, Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.,103
2374,JERRY, I really don't see the difference.,103
2375,GEORGE," Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.",103
2376,JERRY, It's subtle.,103
2377,GEORGE," Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?",103
2378,JERRY,"  Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.",103
2379,GEORGE, What?,103
2380,JERRY," Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.",103
2381,GEORGE," Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?",103
2382,JERRY, Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.,103
2383,GEORGE, Really?,103
2384,JERRY," Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.",103
2385,ELAINE,  Hey.,103
2386,GEORGE," You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.",103
2387,JERRY," Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.",103
2388,GEORGE,  Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.,103
2389,JERRY," No, I told you I admire your hearing.",103
2390,JERRY," No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.",103
2391,ELAINE,"  Wendy, George.  Wendy.",103
2392,GEORGE," You're uh, physical therapist, right?",103
2393,GEORGE," You know, I got this little swelling right here.  It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?",103
2394,ELAINE,  George.,103
2395,GEORGE,"  Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.",103
2396,GEORGE,  Oh! Okay.,103
2397,GEORGE," Oh, thank you.",103
2398,ELAINE, Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.,103
2399,JERRY, Bye.,103
2400,ELAINE,  What did you do that for?,103
2401,GEORGE, What?,103
2402,ELAINE,  Ask about your arm.,103
2403,GEORGE, I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.,103
2404,ELAINE, She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.,103
2405,GEORGE, Why not?,103
2406,ELAINE," Because, it is what she does.",103
2407,GEORGE," I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions.  They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office.  When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!",103
2408,ELAINE," George, you got a little something, right here.",103
2409,GEORGE,  People think they're so important...,103
2410,JERRY,"  Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.",103
2411,ELAINE, Why?,103
2412,JERRY," Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.",103
2413,GEORGE,  What're you getting?,103
2414,JERRY,"  And what's with that hairdo, by the way?",103
2415,ELAINE," Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.",103
2416,JERRY, She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.,103
2417,ELAINE," Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.",103
2418,JERRY, Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.,103
2419,ELAINE, Yeah. Hah.,103
2420,GEORGE," Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.",103
2421,ELAINE," No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.",103
2422,JERRY," What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.",103
2423,ELAINE,"  Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...",103
2424,ELAINE,  ...Kramer.,103
2425,KRAMER," Hello, boys and girls.",103
2426,JERRY, Speak of the devil.,103
2427,KRAMER," Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.",103
2428,JERRY, What for?,103
2429,KRAMER," Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.",103
2430,JERRY, Why?,103
2431,KRAMER," So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.",103
2432,JERRY,"  I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.",103
2433,KRAMER," Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say ""Hey, Carl!"" and he says ""Hey, Jerry!"" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.",103
2434,JERRY,"  Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.",103
2435,KRAMER,  You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?,103
2436,ELAINE,  Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.,103
2437,JERRY," Hello, uncle Leo!",103
2438,JERRY, Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.,103
2439,JERRY, Hi Nana.,103
2440,JERRY, Yes.  Yes of course.,103
2441,JERRY,"  What're you doing, I got it.",103
2442,JERRY, Will you stop it.,103
2443,JERRY, Uncle Leo!  Alright! Take it!,103
2444,JERRY, I'm just not getting any hot water.,103
2445,JERRY," Thanks, Julio.",103
2446,JERRY, Huh?,103
2447,KRAMER,"  Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!",103
2448,JERRY, What's going on here?,103
2449,KRAMER,"  Ohh, nothing, nothing.",103
2450,JERRY,"  Well, then what're you doing?",103
2451,KRAMER," Oh, I, I need a pen.",103
2452,JERRY, What for?,103
2453,KRAMER," Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.",103
2454,JERRY,"  You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?",103
2455,KRAMER, You got that straight.,103
2456,JERRY," I told you, forget it.",103
2457,KRAMER," Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!",103
2458,JERRY, You're robbing me.,103
2459,KRAMER," Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.",103
2460,ELAINE, Wha... W.. Are you going home?,103
2461,KRAMER, Yeah.,103
2462,ELAINE," Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?",103
2463,KRAMER, Why?,103
2464,ELAINE, No reason.  Just wanna see you again.,103
2465,JERRY,  So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?,103
2466,ELAINE," Yeah, she'll be here any second.",103
2467,JERRY," Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?",103
2468,ELAINE," Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.",103
2469,JERRY," Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track?  Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty?  How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened.  Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.",103
2470,JERRY, Yeah?,103
2471,JERRY, Come on up.,103
2472,ELAINE," Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?",103
2473,JERRY," No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.",103
2474,ELAINE, What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?,103
2475,JERRY," It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.",103
2476,ELAINE, How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?,103
2477,JERRY," Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.",103
2478,ELAINE,  That's her. That's her.,103
2479,JERRY,  Hi Wendy.,103
2480,JERRY,  Would you like something to drink?,103
2481,JERRY,  There you go.,103
2482,JERRY," Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.",103
2483,JERRY," So, how's everything going?",103
2484,JERRY," Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.",103
2485,ELAINE," Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.",103
2486,KRAMER, Hey! Jerry!,103
2487,JERRY," C'mon, that's not fair!",103
2488,KRAMER, I told you I was gonna get it.,103
2489,JERRY," No, c'mon Kramer.  Gimme that picture.",103
2490,KRAMER,  Aagh. No no no no no.,103
2491,JERRY,"  Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?",103
2492,ELAINE," Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.",103
2493,KRAMER," Oh, hello.",103
2494,KRAMER,  Yeah.,103
2495,KRAMER,"  You know, I really like that hairdo.",103
2496,ELAINE,"  Oh, you were?",103
2497,KRAMER,"  Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.",103
2498,ELAINE," Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...",103
2499,KRAMER," No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.",103
2500,ELAINE," Oh, Kramer.",103
2501,ELAINE, You wanna go out with him?,103
2502,ELAINE," Well, it's just that... uh, I don't...",103
2503,ELAINE, I'm just thinking about the question.,103
2504,GEORGE," You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. ",103
2505,GEORGE,"  Yeah, same time.  There you go.",103
2506,GEORGE, What for?,103
2507,GEORGE,"  Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.",103
2508,GEORGE,  Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.,103
2509,GEORGE,"  Oh, you have a policy!  The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.",103
2510,GEORGE," Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!",103
2511,KRAMER, Hey!  So what d'you think? You like it?,103
2512,JERRY," Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...",103
2513,JERRY, ...You can't put that picture up.,103
2514,KRAMER," Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.",103
2515,KRAMER, Hey...,103
2516,KRAMER," ...Steve.  Ah, you see?",103
2517,ELAINE," Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.",103
2518,KRAMER,"  Well, how do you do?",103
2519,JERRY," Oh. Hello, uh  Mary.",103
2520,KRAMER,  What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?,103
2521,JERRY,  Yeah.,103
2522,JERRY," Oh, sure, yeah.",103
2523,JERRY," Oh, no!",103
2524,JERRY, You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!,103
2525,ELAINE,"  Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee...",103
2526,JERRY, What is so funny?,103
2527,ELAINE," Nothing, nothing. ",103
2528,JERRY," Hello. Oh, hi mom.  What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't!  Alright, I will.  Okay, bye.",103
2529,JERRY,  Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!,103
2530,ELAINE, Why?,103
2531,JERRY,  I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.,103
2532,JERRY,  Hi Joan.,103
2533,JERRY, Pretty good.,103
2534,JERRY," Okay, great.",103
2535,JERRY," Oh, I'm delighted.",103
2536,JERRY, You too.,103
2537,JERRY," Hi, Louise.",103
2538,KRAMER, Hey.,103
2539,JERRY," Ah, well. Thank you very much!",103
2540,KRAMER, For what?,103
2541,JERRY,"  For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!",103
2542,KRAMER," You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.",103
2543,JERRY, Family?,103
2544,KRAMER, Yeah.,103
2545,JERRY," You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.",103
2546,GEORGE, What d'you mean?,103
2547,GEORGE, When did you leave the message?,103
2548,GEORGE,"  Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.",103
2549,GEORGE," Will that be cash, or cheque?",103
2550,ELAINE," Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing.",103
2551,ELAINE," Ugh, the hell with 'em.",103
2552,ELAINE, What're you stopping here for?,103
2553,ELAINE,"  Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.",103
2554,ELAINE," Yeah, but it's only three blocks.",103
2555,ELAINE,"  Alright, well...",103
2556,ELAINE," She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?",103
2557,JERRY," Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.",103
2558,ELAINE," I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says ""Well, this is as far as I can take you.""",103
2559,JERRY," I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.",103
2560,ELAINE," I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.",103
2561,JERRY, You should have her work on it for you.,103
2562,ELAINE," Yeah, alright, I gotta go.",103
2563,JERRY, Hi Mary.,103
2564,JERRY," Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....",103
2565,JERRY, ...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.,103
2566,JERRY, Hi Louise...,103
2567,JERRY," ...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore.  I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.",103
2568,JERRY,  Thank you for your cooperation.,103
2569,JERRY, Hello.,103
2570,JERRY," Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?",103
2571,JERRY," Okay, I will.",103
2572,KRAMER, What's up?,103
2573,JERRY,"  Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.",103
2574,KRAMER, Oh.,103
2575,JERRY," Hey, Kramer, look at this.",103
2576,JERRY, Look at my picture!,103
2577,JERRY, I've been defaced!,103
2578,KRAMER," Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.",103
2579,KRAMER," Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?",103
2580,JERRY, Hi Jack.,103
2581,JERRY," Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?",103
2582,JERRY,"  No no, that's not true!",103
2583,JERRY," You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.",103
2584,JERRY, Buddy?,103
2585,GEORGE,"  Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!",103
2586,GEORGE, Elaine?,103
2587,ELAINE,  George!,103
2588,GEORGE,  Hah. Good luck.,103
2589,ELAINE,"  Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?",103
2590,ELAINE,  Insurance? You're charging me?,103
2591,GEORGE," Wednesday? That's your personal business?!  Skiing?!  So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?",103
2592,GEORGE, I hear everything.,103
2593,ELAINE," Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.",103
2594,GEORGE, Yeah. Let's go.,103
2595,ELAINE,"  And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.",103
2596,ELAINE," Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you?  Uh, tell her.",103
2597,JERRY, So you were with him that day at the track?,103
2598,JERRY, Leo?,103
2599,JERRY, Is that so?,103
2600,JERRY," Well, that's very interesting.",103
2601,JERRY,  Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours.  You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.,103
2602,JERRY,  You're busted!,103
2603,JERRY," Hey, Steve. How you doing?",103
2604,JERRY," Hey, Jeff. What's happening?",103
2605,JERRY," Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.",103
2606,JERRY," Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!",103
2607,JERRY," Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...",103
2608,KRAMER, Hi.,103
2609,JERRY, Hey. Could I use your shower?,103
2610,KRAMER," What, again? You took one this morning.",103
2611,JERRY,"  I got a date. C'mon, please.",103
2612,KRAMER, I know but I...  Little problem.,103
2613,KRAMER,  Wendy here?,103
2614,KRAMER," No no no. She changed her hairstyle,  it's terrible. No, we're done.",103
2615,KRAMER," Oh yeah, yeah, great.  And get some of those blue corn chips.",103
2616,KRAMER, Hey.,103
2617,KRAMER, Hi.,103
2618,KRAMER," Ooh, I like that.",103
2619,JERRY,  Who's that?,103
2620,KRAMER, Stefanie. 2-G.,103
2621,JERRY, Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.,103
2622,KRAMER," Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.",103
2623,JERRY,"  Oh, yeah, I understand.",103
2624,JERRY,"You remember a few years ago in New York, we had the doorman strike? They have a union, in the fancy buildings, and they went out on strike. Now you would think, if any group of people would not wanna demonstrate what life would be like without them, it would be doormen.  ""Let's see how they do without us!"" There's no doorman, people open the door, they walk in, it's... you know. Who's gonna walk out next? The guys who clean your windshield at the traffic light, with the dirty rag?  ""We demand shorter yellows, and longer reds!""",104
2625,JERRY,"  Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.",104
2626,JERRY," Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.",104
2627,JERRY, Yeah.,104
2628,JERRY, Can I just go up?,104
2629,JERRY, How 'bout those Knicks?,104
2630,JERRY, Yeah.,104
2631,KRAMER," So, you think your parents'll get back together?",104
2632,GEORGE," I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.",104
2633,KRAMER," Hey, George, stick 'em up.",104
2634,GEORGE, What?,104
2635,KRAMER, For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.,104
2636,GEORGE, Why?,104
2637,KRAMER, So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.,104
2638,KRAMER," Awright, hands up, porky!",104
2639,KRAMER," That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!",104
2640,KRAMER,  Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!,104
2641,GEORGE," Alright, that's enough.",104
2642,KRAMER," I'll tell you when it's enough!  Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!",104
2643,ELAINE," Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.",104
2644,JERRY, I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.,104
2645,ELAINE, What guy?,104
2646,JERRY, The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?,104
2647,ELAINE, Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier.  Whugh!  Ha-ha.,104
2648,JERRY," Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?",104
2649,ELAINE,  I...,104
2650,JERRY, We'll still make the movie.,104
2651,ELAINE,"  Okay, okay.",104
2652,GEORGE," What'd you do today, dad?",104
2653,GEORGE, I don't have a hi-fi.,104
2654,GEORGE,  I gave it to Cosmo.,104
2655,KRAMER, I'm Cosmo.,104
2656,KRAMER,"  One-two, cha-cha-cha.",104
2657,GEORGE,"  Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?",104
2658,ELAINE," Jerry, it's six.  Let's go.",104
2659,JERRY," Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.",104
2660,ELAINE," No, don't...",104
2661,JERRY,"  Hello?  Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.",104
2662,ELAINE,  Give that to me.,104
2663,ELAINE,  Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?,104
2664,ELAINE," A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.",104
2665,JERRY," Alright, he just left. We can go.",104
2666,ELAINE," Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving.  Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.",104
2667,ELAINE," Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.",104
2668,ELAINE, Alright.  I can't go.,104
2669,ELAINE," ...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...",104
2670,JERRY,  You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?,104
2671,JERRY, So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?,104
2672,JERRY," Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.",104
2673,GEORGE, My father opened his shirt...,104
2674,JERRY," Yeah, and?",104
2675,GEORGE,"  Tell him, Kramer.",104
2676,KRAMER,  He had breasts.,104
2677,JERRY," What d'you mean, breasts?",104
2678,GEORGE,  Big breasts!,104
2679,JERRY, So what? A lot of older men have that.,104
2680,KRAMER," No, not these. These were real hooters.",104
2681,GEORGE, I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.,104
2682,KRAMER," Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.",104
2683,GEORGE,"  Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?",104
2684,JERRY," But, your father's not bald.",104
2685,GEORGE," No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.",104
2686,JERRY, Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.,104
2687,KRAMER," You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.",104
2688,GEORGE, You mean like a bra?,104
2689,KRAMER, A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.,104
2690,JERRY," Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?",104
2691,KRAMER," I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.",104
2692,GEORGE,  What!!,104
2693,GEORGE," Oh, Huh, imagine that.",104
2694,ELAINE,  What? What'd you say to the doorman?,104
2695,JERRY, What? Nothing.,104
2696,ELAINE,"  He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.",104
2697,JERRY, What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?,104
2698,ELAINE," Hey, did you make the movie?",104
2699,JERRY, No.,104

2707,JERRY,  Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.,104
2708,JERRY,"  Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.",104

2741,JERRY, He asked me to. We were getting along.,104
2742,ELAINE,"  You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.",104
2743,JERRY," Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!",104
2744,ELAINE,"  Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.",104

2752,ELAINE," Okay, you came to pick me up at...",104
2753,JERRY, Right.,104

2755,JERRY, What? I said right.,104
2756,ELAINE," Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.",104
2757,JERRY, But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.,104
2758,ELAINE,  So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!,104
2759,JERRY, But I don't know if this is gonna work.,104
2760,ELAINE,  Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!,104
2761,JERRY, Okay.,104
2762,ELAINE, Good. Now fix me a drink.,104
2763,KRAMER, How's that feel?,104

2765,KRAMER," Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.",104
2766,KRAMER," I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?",104
2767,KRAMER,"  Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.",104

2772,GEORGE, Dad. We need to talk.,104
2773,ELAINE," Oh really?  The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?",104
2774,ELAINE,"  Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?",104
2775,ELAINE,"  He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it.  You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.",104
2776,ELAINE,  Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.,104
2777,JERRY, You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?,104
2778,ELAINE,  There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.,104
2779,JERRY,  Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!,104
2780,ELAINE, Is it possible we were victims of a sting?,104
2781,JERRY, I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.,104
2782,ELAINE," Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?",104
2783,ELAINE, We have to replace the couch.,104
2784,JERRY, Now we have to buy a new couch?!,104

2786,JERRY, The one with the Poppie stain?!,104
2787,GEORGE," Yeah, sure.  Then my father will have no place to sleep.  He's gotta move out.",104
2788,ELAINE, But it's got a pee-stain on it.,104
2789,GEORGE," No, the cushion's turned over.",104
2790,ELAINE,  I guess.,104
2791,GEORGE,  Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!,104
2792,KRAMER," Now, it's called the bro.",104
2793,KRAMER," Yeah, but I prefer the bro.",104
2794,KRAMER, Yeah.,104
2795,KRAMER,  I told you.,104
2796,KRAMER, Uh.,104
2797,KRAMER," Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.",104

As an avid reader I've always wondered if the letters  are I'm a dentist and one afternoon my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients. Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if ......... ",105
3064,JERRY, I hear you're going out with David Putty.,107
3065,ELAINE," Yeah. What, is it a problem?",107
3066,JERRY," Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.",107
3067,ELAINE," Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.",107
3068,JERRY," Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.",107
3069,ELAINE," Oh, god.",107
3070,JERRY," The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.",107
3071,ELAINE," Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.",107
3072,JERRY, All right.,107
3073,GEORGE," Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.",107
3074,GEORGE," You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.",107
3075,GEORGE," An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.",107
3076,GEORGE," No, you're not a divorcee. Youÿre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.",107
3077,GEORGE," No, you're not out there.",107
3078,GEORGE," You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!",107
3079,GEORGE, Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---,107
3080,GEORGE," Kramer, hey, hey! ",107
3081,KRAMER," Hi, little buddy.",107
3082,GEORGE, Come on over and sit down.,107
3083,KRAMER," Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.",107
3084,GEORGE," No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...",107
3085,KRAMER," All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? ",107
3086,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.",107
3087,GEORGE, She's not out there!,107
3088,KRAMER," So, who is your doctor?",107
3089,KRAMER, . He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.,107
3090,GEORGE," Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?",107
3091,KRAMER, Tuesday? Uh...,107
3092,GEORGE, Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.,107
3093,KRAMER," Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.",107
3094,GEORGE," Well, giddy-up!",107
3095,KRAMER," Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.",107
3096,KRAMER, All righty...,107
3097,KRAMER,"  Okay. . Thanks.  Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.",107
3098,KRAMER, Cosmo Kramer.,107
3099,KRAMER, No! I'm not the Assman.,107
3100,ELAINE, Fine.,107
3101,ELAINE, No.,107
3102,ELAINE," No, nothing.",107
3103,JERRY, Hi.,107
3104,ELAINE, I was with David *Putty* last night.,107
3105,JERRY," Yeah, so.",107
3106,ELAINE, He did the move.,107
3107,JERRY, What move?,107
3108,ELAINE, You know...*the* move.,107
3109,JERRY, Wait a second. *My* move?,107
3110,JERRY, David Putty used *my* move?,107
3111,ELAINE," Yes, yes.",107
3112,JERRY, Are you sure?,107
3113,ELAINE, Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.,107
3114,JERRY, I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.,107
3115,ELAINE, What else did you tell  him.  The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!,107
3116,JERRY," Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.",107
3117,ELAINE, Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?,107
3118,JERRY," Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.",107
3119,ELAINE," Well, wait---wait a second.",107
3120,JERRY, What?,107
3121,ELAINE, Isn't that a little...rash?,107
3122,JERRY, No! He stole my move!,107
3123,ELAINE," Yeah, but...*I* like the move.",107
3124,JERRY," Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.",107
3125,ELAINE," Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!",107
3126,JERRY," Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.",107
3127,ELAINE," You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.",107
3128,JERRY," I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.",107
3129,JERRY, ...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.,107
3130,GEORGE," You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry.  Gimme a bite.",107
3131,JERRY, Can I just get it opened first?,107
3132,GEORGE, I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.,107
3133,JERRY," All right, all right. Here. .",107
3134,GEORGE,"  Oh, that's good. That's very good.",107
3135,JERRY, You feel better?,107
3136,GEORGE," Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.",107
3137,JERRY, Nancy Klopper?,107
3138,GEORGE," Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.",107
3139,JERRY," All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---",107
3140,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.",107
3141,JERRY," It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---",107
3142,GEORGE, You're gonna tell me...or not.,107
3143,JERRY, All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.,107
3144,GEORGE, I got a headboard.,107
3145,JERRY, Is it padded?,107
3146,GEORGE, No.,107
3147,JERRY, Good. How tall is she?,107
3148,GEORGE, Five-foot four. Why?,107
3149,JERRY," You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.",107
3150,GEORGE, I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.,107
3151,JERRY," George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.",107
3152,JERRY," Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.",107
3153,GEORGE, Is it a clockwise swirl?,107
3154,JERRY," I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.",107
3155,KRAMER," Here you go, buddy. .",107
3156,JERRY, What is it?,107
3157,KRAMER, *Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?,107
3158,JERRY, When did you do this?,107
3159,KRAMER," In my spare time. . You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.",107
3160,JERRY, Oh... Why Fusilli?,107
3161,KRAMER, Because *you're* silly. Get it?  Yeah...,107
3162,JERRY," Well, thank you very much.",107
3163,GEORGE," So, did you get your new plates?",107
3164,KRAMER, Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.,107
3165,GEORGE, What do they say?,107
3166,KRAMER, Assman.,107
3167,JERRY, Assman?,107
3168,KRAMER," Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!",107
3169,JERRY," Who would order a license plate that says ""Assman""?",107
3170,GEORGE, Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.,107
3171,JERRY, It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.,107
3172,KRAMER," Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.",107
3173,JERRY, Yeah. Proctologist.,107
3174,GEORGE, Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.,107
3175,KRAMER," Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way",107
3176,KRAMER, Oh! There's my phone. ,107
3177,GEORGE," So, where you gonna stick this ",107
3178,JERRY, I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.,107
3179,JERRY," Hey, David.",107
3180,JERRY," Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.",107
3181,JERRY, What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.,107
3182,JERRY," The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.",107
3183,JERRY, Swirl.,107
3184,JERRY," Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.",107
3185,JERRY," You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.",107
3186,JERRY," Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.",107
3187,JERRY, Fine.,107
3188,GEORGE,"  Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.",107
3189,GEORGE, You don't like the move?,107
3190,GEORGE, You're kidding.,107
3191,GEORGE, Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.,107
3192,ELAINE," Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!",107
3193,ELAINE, What?!!,107
3194,ELAINE, What?,107
3195,ELAINE," Oh, oh, come on, please?",107
3196,ELAINE," Oh, so---so that's it?",107
3197,KRAMER," ""Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for."" .",107
3198,KRAMER," Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer.  Proctology.",107
3199,KRAMER, Thanks. Have a good day.,107
3200,KRAMER, I just can't get over how fantastic you look.,107
3201,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off.",107
3202,KRAMER," Oh, yeah.",107
3203,KRAMER, You got that straight!,107
3204,JERRY, You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?,107
3205,GEORGE, Supposed to close with the swirl?,107
3206,JERRY," Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.",107
3207,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.",107
3208,JERRY, Yeah?,107
3209,JERRY, C'mon up.  You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.,107
3210,JERRY," Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.",107
3211,GEORGE," What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.",107
3212,JERRY, Except that it's not Putty.,107
3213,GEORGE, What happened to Putty?,107
3214,JERRY," Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.",107
3215,GEORGE," Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. ""By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there."" ""Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on.""",107
3216,JERRY," Hey, Elaine.",107
3217,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, hello.",107
3218,JERRY, Is it something I said?,107
3219,ELAINE, Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.,107
3220,JERRY, Really?,107
3221,ELAINE," Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.",107
3222,JERRY, What is it?,107
3223,ELAINE," Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.",107
3224,JERRY, Huh.,107
3225,ELAINE," I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!",107
3226,GEORGE, Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?,107
3227,ELAINE," Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.",107
3228,GEORGE, I think that's mine.,107
3229,ELAINE, I'm not surprised.,107
3230,JERRY, Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?,107
3231,ELAINE, Why?,107
3232,JERRY, You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.,107
3233,ELAINE, An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?,107
3234,JERRY," Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. ",107
3235,ELAINE,  What? What is this?,107
3236,JERRY," That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.",107
3237,ELAINE, Fusilli Jerry?,107
3238,JERRY, Yeah. Kramer made it.,107
3239,GEORGE," All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.",107
3240,JERRY," Hey, Assman!",107
3241,KRAMER," Hey, well, this is Sally.",107
3242,JERRY, Hi.,107
3243,ELAINE, Hi.,107
3244,KRAMER, Shall we go?,107
3245,ELAINE," Hey, let me ask you a question.",107
3246,ELAINE, What do you charge for blown shocks?,107
3247,ELAINE," Two, three hundred?",107
3248,ELAINE, Ah.,107
3249,ELAINE, What about a bad gasket?,107
3250,ELAINE, Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.,107
3251,ELAINE," Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.",107
3252,ELAINE, Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.,107
3253,ELAINE, Oh.,107
3254,ELAINE, Is that with the parts and labor?,107
3255,ELAINE, Hmm.,107
3256,ELAINE," Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....",107
3257,GEORGE, It just came to me.,107
3258,GEORGE, You mean in the end?,107
3259,GEORGE, A counter-clockwise swirl.,107
3260,GEORGE, What?,107
3261,GEORGE, Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.,107
3262,GEORGE, It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.,107
3263,GEORGE," You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!",107
3264,JERRY," Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.",107
3265,ELAINE, So what are you going to do?,107
3266,JERRY," Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.",107
3267,ELAINE, Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?,107
3268,JERRY, Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.,107
3269,JERRY," Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?",107
3270,JERRY, I don't know. Why?,107
3271,JERRY, What do you mean?,107
3272,JERRY," Really, stopping short. That's a good move.",107

3291,GEORGE," Ma, don't cry!",107
3292,GEORGE," Ma, your eyes!",107
3293,JERRY," What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. ",108
3294,ELAINE, Is that the supermodel?,108
3295,JERRY," Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.",108
3296,ELAINE, I thought you had a show in Ithaca.,108
3297,JERRY," I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.",108
3298,ELAINE," Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.",108
3299,JERRY, So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.,108
3300,ELAINE, I've had enough. I am marchin' in.,108
3301,JERRY, You're marchin' in.,108
3302,ELAINE, I'm marchin'. ,108
3303,GEORGE, Hey.,108

3307,GEORGE, I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.,108
3308,JERRY, How 'bout the march out?,108
3309,GEORGE, Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.,108
3310,ELAINE, This is it. Wish me luck.,108
3311,JERRY, Get a march goin'! March it! ,108

3315,JERRY, What for?,108
3316,GEORGE," They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.",108
3317,JERRY, Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?,108
3318,GEORGE, It better be.,108
3319,ELAINE," Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.",108
3320,ELAINE, Mr. Pitt...,108
3321,ELAINE, What?,108
3322,ELAINE,  Mr. Pitt...,108
3323,ELAINE," Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,",108
3324,ELAINE," We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.",108
3325,GEORGE,"  Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?",108
3326,GEORGE," Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go...  Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.",108
3327,GEORGE," No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...",108
3328,ELAINE, Oh my God.,108
3329,ELAINE," Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?",108
3330,ELAINE," Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.",108
3331,ELAINE, I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. ,108
3332,JERRY," Yes, I know. I've flown before.",108
3333,JERRY, No.,108
3334,KRAMER," Hey, how you doin'?",108
3335,KRAMER, Name's Kramer.,108
3336,KRAMER," Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving.",108
3337,KRAMER," Bet? Um, not betting.",108
3338,KRAMER," I haven't made a bet in three years, I-",108
3339,KRAMER," Okay, how much?",108
3340,KRAMER," You're on, cowboy!",108
3341,GEORGE, How ya doin'?,108

3347,ELAINE," Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?",108

3349,JERRY, I don't care.,108
3350,JERRY, Who?,108
3351,JERRY," I don't care, why are you telling me this?",108
3352,JERRY, Why would I freak out?  Pilot...,108

3354,JERRY," No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.",108
3355,JERRY," If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.",108
3356,JERRY," Oh, it doesn't matter now.",108
3357,JERRY," Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!",108
3358,KRAMER," All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.",108

3363,KRAMER, I'm at the airport.,108

3365,KRAMER, Sure you do.,108
3366,KRAMER," Oh help me man, I'm desperate!",108
3367,JERRY,  What is the complication?,108

3369,JERRY, What?,108
3370,JERRY, I didn't care.,108
3371,JERRY, He can't just throw me off the plane!,108
3372,JERRY, But I'm not a disturbance!,108

3374,JERRY, I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!,108
3375,JERRY, Which one do you think I want?,108
3376,JERRY, Then we'll make it the eight.,108
3377,JERRY, Hotel?,108
3378,JERRY," No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.",108
3379,JERRY," I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?",108
3380,GEORGE, Yo.,108
3381,JERRY, George.,108
3382,GEORGE," Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca?",108
3383,JERRY," I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...",108
3384,GEORGE," Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?",108
3385,JERRY," Carl, I think.",108
3386,GEORGE," Carl... Yeah, he was a nice guy.",108
3387,JERRY," Yeah, he was nice.",108
3388,GEORGE, What company was it?,108
3389,JERRY, Defent.,108
3390,GEORGE," Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...",108
3391,JERRY, You need an exterminator?,108
3392,GEORGE," No, not really.",108
3393,JERRY," Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?",108
3394,GEORGE, Gotta go.,108
3395,JERRY," George, George!",108
3396,JERRY," Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?",108
3397,ELAINE, Hello?,108
3398,JERRY," Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.",108
3399,ELAINE," That's at the airport, right?",108
3400,JERRY," Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.",108
3401,ELAINE," All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.",108
3402,JERRY, I am a little freaked out!,108
3403,ELAINE," Calm down, I'll take care of it. ",108
3404,JERRY," All right, but you have to go now.",108
3405,ELAINE, I said I'll take care of it!,108
3406,KRAMER, Hey.,108
3407,KRAMER, Good.  Here's my collateral.,108
3408,KRAMER," Yeah, don't I know it.",108
3409,KRAMER," All right, how 'bout Ithaca vs. Boston?",108
3410,KRAMER, Double or nothin'.,108
3411,JERRY,  Where are we?,108
3412,JERRY, Is this even a road?,108
3413,JERRY, What? Why didn't you wake me up?,108
3414,JERRY," No, road is a major detail!",108
3415,JERRY,  Look out!,108
3416,GEORGE, May I help you?,108
3417,GEORGE," Oh, yes of course, come in.",108
3418,GEORGE," Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?",108
3419,GEORGE," Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.",108
3420,GEORGE," Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on...  Is Mr. Morgan in?",108
3421,GEORGE," He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?",108
3422,JERRY, That's it! No more questions! I don't care!,108
3423,GEORGE,"  Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor",108
3424,GEORGE," That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.",108
3425,KRAMER," Yeah, he was.",108
3426,KRAMER, Oh I accept.,108
3427,KRAMER," Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. ",108
3428,ELAINE, Kramer.,108
3429,KRAMER, Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?,108
3430,ELAINE, Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?,108
3431,ELAINE," Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?",108
3432,KRAMER, Boy...,108
3433,ELAINE, Uh huh.,108
3434,KRAMER, C'mon!,108
3435,KRAMER, What?,108
3436,ELAINE," Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!",108
3437,ELAINE, Goodbye? ,108
3438,JERRY, Bridget!,108
3439,JERRY," Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.",108
3440,JERRY," Really?  Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!",108
3441,GEORGE," I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.",108
3442,GEORGE," Check, please.",108
3443,GEORGE, Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!,108
3444,GEORGE," Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?",109
3445,GEORGE," And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.",109
3446,GEORGE," It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.",109
3447,GEORGE," You find this interesting, don't you?",109
3448,ELAINE,"  Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.",109
3449,JERRY, What are you telling him for?,109
3450,ELAINE, What?,109
3451,JERRY," He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?",109
3452,ELAINE," Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?",109
3453,JERRY," Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, ""Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!""?",109
3454,ELAINE," Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?",109
3455,JERRY," Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.",109
3456,ELAINE," I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.",109
3457,JERRY, John Houseman?,109
3458,ELAINE," No, Alec Berg.",109
3459,ELAINE, Hi!,109
3460,JERRY," Hi, Alec.",109
3461,JERRY, Yeah.,109
3462,JERRY," Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?",109
3463,JERRY," Oh, I'd love to, are you sure?",109
3464,JERRY, Gee thanks! Thanks a lot!,109
3465,JERRY," Alright, thanks again.",109
3466,ELAINE, Thank you very much.,109
3467,JERRY," Really, thank you.",109
3468,JERRY, Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?,109
3469,ELAINE, Who?,109
3470,JERRY," These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?",109
3471,ELAINE, I will never understand people.,109
3472,JERRY, They're the worst.,109
3473,GEORGE," Something's up, there's something in the air.",109
3474,JERRY," Well, what is with you?",109
3475,GEORGE," Well, I think this is it.",109
3476,ELAINE, What's it?,109
3477,GEORGE, I saw Siena again.,109
3478,ELAINE, Siena?,109
3479,JERRY," Yeah, he's dating a crayon.",109
3480,GEORGE, We discussed toilet paper.,109
3481,JERRY, Toilet paper?,109
3482,GEORGE," Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!",109
3483,JERRY, What are you talking about?,109
3484,ELAINE, Yeah.,109
3485,JERRY, Toilet paper's changed.,109
3486,ELAINE, Yeah.,109
3487,JERRY, It's softer.,109
3488,ELAINE, Softer.,109
3489,JERRY, More sheets per roll,109
3490,ELAINE, Sheets.,109
3491,JERRY, Comes in a wide variety of colors.,109
3492,ELAINE, Colors.,109
3493,GEORGE," Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.",109
3494,JERRY, What?,109
3495,GEORGE," I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.",109
3496,JERRY," Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?",109
3497,GEORGE, Fifty-fifty.,109
3498,JERRY," Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.",109
3499,GEORGE," Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?",109
3500,ELAINE," What, you never said it?",109
3501,GEORGE," Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.",109
3502,JERRY," Well, so it wasn't a total loss.",109
3503,KRAMER, Hey.,109
3504,JERRY," Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!",109
3505,KRAMER," Oh, I'm there, Monongahela!",109
3506,JERRY," What about you, George?",109
3507,GEORGE," Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.",109
3508,KRAMER," So, so.",109
3509,GEORGE," Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.",109
3510,KRAMER," She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.",109
3511,JERRY," Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?",109
3512,ELAINE," Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.",109
3513,JERRY," Sure, fine with me.",109
3514,GEORGE," Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer.",109
3515,KRAMER, So she works at the zoo?,109
3516,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah.",109
3517,KRAMER," Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.",109
3518,ELAINE, So how long have you been a Devils' fan?,109
3519,ELAINE," Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.",109
3520,ELAINE, Yes.,109
3521,ELAINE," Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.",109
3522,ELAINE, What the--,109
3523,ELAINE, What is that?,109
3524,ELAINE,  You painted your face?,109
3525,ELAINE, Why?,109
3526,ELAINE," Well, you can't walk around like that.",109
3527,ELAINE, Because it's insane?,109
3528,KRAMER, Hey.,109
3529,ELAINE," Dave, um, painted his face.",109
3530,KRAMER," Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.",109
3531,KRAMER, Yeah.,109
3532,ELAINE, Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!,109
3533,GEORGE," You know, I could have actually gone to that.",109
3534,GEORGE," Well, I didn't want to break our date.",109
3535,GEORGE, Because I... I love you.,109
3536,KRAMER," Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over.  Watch out!",109
3537,JERRY," ""I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.""",109
3538,GEORGE, Yup.,109
3539,JERRY, Big matzoh ball.,109
3540,GEORGE, Huge matzoh ball.,109
3541,JERRY, Those damn 'I love you' returns.,109
3542,GEORGE," Well, it's all over. I slipped up.",109
3543,JERRY," Oh, you don't know.",109
3544,GEORGE," You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, ""I love you"", and the other says, ""I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."".",109
3545,JERRY, Unless you're married.,109
3546,GEORGE," I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.",109
3547,JERRY," No, people hate that.",109
3548,GEORGE, You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.,109
3549,JERRY, Ideally.,109
3550,GEORGE, I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.,109
3551,GEORGE, That'd be me.,109
3552,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry? You're a smart guy, right?",109
3553,JERRY, No question about it.,109
3554,KRAMER," Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.",109
3555,JERRY, At the zoo?,109
3556,KRAMER," Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.",109
3557,JERRY," Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?",109
3558,KRAMER," Well, he started it!",109
3559,JERRY," It's a monkey, Kramer!",109
3560,KRAMER," Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.",109
3561,JERRY," Well, I still think it's wrong.",109
3562,KRAMER," Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.",109
3563,JERRY, I'm not taking anyone's side.,109
3564,KRAMER,"  Cause I know what happened, Jerry.  Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?",109
3565,JERRY, No.,109
3566,KRAMER," Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?",109
3567,JERRY," What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?",109
3568,KRAMER," Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.",109
3569,JERRY," No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.",109
3570,KRAMER," Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.",109
3571,JERRY," Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.",109
3572,KRAMER," Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.",109
3573,JERRY," Ah, you're out of your mind.",109
3574,KRAMER," Alright, where you going?",109
3575,JERRY," I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.",109
3576,KRAMER, Who died?,109
3577,JERRY, Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?,109
3578,KRAMER, So he actually had it?,109
3579,JERRY," No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.",109
3580,ELAINE, That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.,109
3581,JERRY, The one Puddy screamed at in the car?,109
3582,ELAINE, Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.,109
3583,JERRY," Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.",109
3584,ELAINE," I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?",109
3585,JERRY, Gotta support the team.,109
3586,ELAINE, You know I really hate my clothes.,109
3587,JERRY, Hm.,109
3588,ELAINE," I open up my closet, there's just nothing.",109
3589,JERRY, Hm.,109
3590,ELAINE," Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it.  I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.",109
3591,JERRY, Hm.,109
3592,ELAINE, It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.,109
3593,JERRY,"  Hey, Alec!",109
3594,JERRY, Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?,109
3595,KRAMER, Yes.,109
3596,KRAMER," So, uh, what did you want to see me about?",109
3597,KRAMER, Barry?,109
3598,KRAMER," Oh. Well, uh, what's the problem?",109
3599,KRAMER," So, so what do you want me to do?",109
3600,KRAMER," Yeah, well he started it.",109
3601,KRAMER," So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--",109
3602,KRAMER,  You know George really likes you.,109
3603,KRAMER, Oh.,109
3604,JERRY," I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?",109
3605,GEORGE," Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?",109
3606,JERRY, Yeah.,109
3607,GEORGE," Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this  That's the biggest.",109
3608,JERRY," Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.",109
3609,GEORGE," Hey, they can't go, ""Hey! You look fabulous!""",109
3610,JERRY, Hey.,109
3611,KRAMER," Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.",109
3612,GEORGE," Girlfriend, yeah, right.",109
3613,KRAMER," Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.",109
3614,GEORGE, Barry?,109
3615,KRAMER, The monkey.,109
3616,JERRY, Well?,109
3617,KRAMER," Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.",109
3618,JERRY," Well, I don't think that's gonna happen.",109
3619,KRAMER," Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?",109
3620,GEORGE, What?,109
3621,KRAMER," Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?",109
3622,GEORGE, Oh my god.,109
3623,JERRY, What?,109
3624,GEORGE, She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!,109
3625,JERRY, Are you gonna say it again?,109
3626,GEORGE," That's the question, Jimmy.",109
3627,GEORGE, I'm gonna do it.,109
3628,JERRY," What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.",109
3629,GEORGE, I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!,109
3630,KRAMER, What's going on?,109
3631,JERRY, He's gonna talk into her other ear.,109
3632,KRAMER," Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?",109
3633,JERRY," Yeah, I saw him.",109
3634,KRAMER," Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?",109
3635,JERRY," Well, not exactly.",109
3636,KRAMER," He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.",109
3637,JERRY, I don't know if he's mad.,109
3638,KRAMER," Alright, so what happened when you saw him?",109
3639,JERRY," Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.",109
3640,KRAMER, Uh huh.,109
3641,JERRY," See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.",109
3642,KRAMER," See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!",109
3643,JERRY," Look, what do you want me to do?",109
3644,KRAMER, I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!,109
3645,JERRY," No. No, I can't!",109
3646,KRAMER," Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!",109
3647,JERRY," Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.",109
3648,KRAMER," You stubborn, stupid, silly man!",109
3649,ELAINE," No, it's from the store.",109
3650,ELAINE," David? David, I think we aught to talk.",109
3651,ELAINE," David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.",109
3652,ELAINE," Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.",109
3653,ELAINE," Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.",109
3654,ELAINE," Yeah, but you like the face painting.",109
3655,ELAINE, Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?,109
3656,ELAINE," That's so, that's so sweet.",109
3657,GEORGE," Siena, I love you.",109
3658,GEORGE, Yeah. Just confirming.,109
3659,JERRY," Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.",109
3660,KRAMER," Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?",109
3661,ELAINE, What is that?,109
3662,ELAINE, Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?,109
3663,ELAINE, But you said no more painting.,109
3664,ELAINE," Yeah, that's right.",109
3665,KRAMER, Well? Did he call?,109
3666,JERRY, No.,109
3667,KRAMER," Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!",109
3668,JERRY," Alright!  Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?",109
3669,JERRY," Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.",109
3670,JERRY," Oh, you already gave them away?",109
3671,JERRY," No, we don't care, we just want to go.",109
3672,ELAINE, Hello father.,109
3673,JERRY," I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I don’t know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because it’s really not a definite thing yet.  Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that I’ve received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes.  Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn’t even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, that’s what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, “You may have already won.” I’d like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, “You have definitely lost!” You turn it over, giant printing, “Not even close!” You open it up, there’s this whole letter of explanation, “Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.”",11
3674,JERRY,  To the right.,11
3675,GEORGE, That took awhile.,11
3676,JERRY, Don’t get up.,11
3677,GEORGE," I’d like to help, but my neck..",11
3678,GEORGE, So how long has it been in the basement?,11
3679,JERRY," Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didn’t want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it’s been sitting down there for three years until he saw it.  All right, so, just take what you want and let’s get it out of here.",11
3680,GEORGE, What’s in it?,11
3681,JERRY," Grandpa clothes, I can’t wear ‘em.",11
3682,KRAMER, You want these? Knee socks. You don’t wear knee socks.,11
3683,JERRY," No, go ahead. Look at this place. I can’t wait to get it cleaned.",11
3684,GEORGE, I know someone who’ll do it. She’s good. She’s honest.,11
3685,JERRY," No, Elaine’s got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and he’s suppose to do it.",11
3686,GEORGE, Students can’t clean. It’s anathema.  They don’t like it.,11
3687,JERRY, How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?,11
3688,KRAMER, Now this I like.,11
3689,GEORGE, Wait a second.  I can’t believe this! Let me see this.,11
3690,KRAMER," Wait, wait, wait...",11
3691,GEORGE, Let me just see it.,11
3692,KRAMER, Come on...,11
3693,GEORGE, Let me just see it for a second.,11
3694,GEORGE," Oh my God, it’s exactly the same!",11
3695,JERRY, What?,11
3696,GEORGE," When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, “MacArthur Park”, and I got to the part about, “I’ll never have that recipe again,” and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.",11
3697,KRAMER," C’mon, George. I saw it first.",11
3698,GEORGE," No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.",11
3699,KRAMER," No, I got dibs!",11
3700,GEORGE," What? No dibs! I need this statue. C’mon, give it!",11
3701,JERRY," Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don’t you just settle it like mature adults?",11
3702,KRAMER, Potato man!,11
3703,GEORGE," No, no, no potato man. Inka-dink.",11
3704,KRAMER, Okay...yea well uh start with me.,11
3705,GEORGE," Yeah, good, good.",11
3706,JERRY," Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.",11
3707,JERRY," Not because you’re dirty, not because you’re clean – just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...",11
3708,JERRY, And you are it!,11
3709,KRAMER," What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. He’s out. I get it.",11
3710,GEORGE," No, no, no, no, I’m It. I win.",11
3711,JERRY," No, he’s It. He wins. It is good.",11
3712,KRAMER, Do over – start with him.,11
3713,JERRY," No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.",11
3714,KRAMER," All right, you can have it. ",11
3715,GEORGE,  Dit.,11
3716,KRAMER," Okay, I’m gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.",11
3717,JERRY," All right, c’mon. Let’s go.",11
3718,KRAMER," Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.",11
3719,GEORGE, I can’t believe I won at Inka-dink.,11
3720,JERRY," Come on, let’s go.",11
3721,GEORGE, Yea.,11
3722,JERRY, Aren’t you gonna take it?,11
3723,GEORGE," No, no, no, I don’t want to carry it around all night. I’ll pick it up later.",11
3724,GEORGE,  What about your stuff?,11
3725,KRAMER," Oh, uh, well - okay.",11
3726,JERRY," All right, let’s go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.",11
3727,GEORGE, What?,11
3728,JERRY, The Inka-dink.. You were It.,11
3729,GEORGE, It’s bad?,11
3730,JERRY, It’s very bad.,11
3731,ELAINE, You told them that?,11
3732,ELAINE,  This is so fantastic. I don’t know how to thank you.,11
3733,JERRY,"  So, where’s this boyfriend of yours? I can’t wait much longer. I’ve got a flight.",11
3734,ELAINE," Oh, probably caught in traffic.",11
3735,JERRY," So what do you write, children’s books?",11
3736,JERRY, All right...,11
3737,JERRY, I gotta get to the airport.,11
3738,JERRY, The uh toilet brush is under the sink.,11
3739,JERRY," I don’t really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there’s that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, you’re sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, “I’m really sorry about this. I don’t know why I left that stuff over there.” And that’s why I could never be a maid, because I’d have an attitude. I’d find them, wherever they are in the house, “Oh, I suppose you couldn’t do this? No, don’t get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldn’t dust. No, this is too tough, isn’t it?”",11
3740,JERRY," He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid!  He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this.  He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!",11
3741,ELAINE, There’s no Rubber Man.,11
3742,JERRY, Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There’s Elastic Man... Plastic Man...,11
3743,ELAINE, I’m leaving.,11
3744,JERRY, Where are you going?,11
3745,ELAINE, To Rava’s house. I’ve gotta pick up her manuscript.,11
3746,JERRY, Oh wait. I’ll go with you.,11
3747,JERRY," Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole!",11
3748,ELAINE,"  So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He’s the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-",11
3749,ELAINE, They're going to promote me to editor.,11
3750,JERRY," Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.",11
3751,JERRY, Shouldn’t you be out on a ledge somewhere?,11
3752,ELAINE, Jerry? Jerry!,11
3753,JERRY, What?,11
3754,JERRY, I think that’s the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!,11
3755,ELAINE, What statue?,11
3756,JERRY, I had a statue!,11
3757,ELAINE, You have a statue? I never saw a statue.,11
3758,JERRY, My grandfather gave me a statue!,11
3759,ELAINE, Since when?,11
3760,JERRY, What’s the difference?! That’s the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!,11
3761,JERRY, I can’t believe it! This guy ripped me off!,11
3762,ELAINE, Do you realize what you’re saying?,11
3763,JERRY, Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!,11
3764,ELAINE, Are you sure?,11
3765,JERRY, Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.,11
3766,ELAINE, Ninety-nine percent sure?!,11
3767,ELAINE, Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it’s just a coincidence.,11
3768,JERRY," Coincidence? This guy’s in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?",11
3769,ELAINE, I never saw the statue.,11
3770,JERRY, I had a statue! What should I do?,11
3771,ELAINE, I don’t know.,11
3772,JERRY, I’ll call Kramer. He can check my house.,11
3773,ELAINE," Oh Jerry, don’t blow this for me.",11
3774,JERRY," Don’t worry.  Kramer! Kramer!... It’s Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!...",11
3775,JERRY," Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye.  My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.",11
3776,JERRY, My mom’s down in Florida. She’s got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?,11
3777,JERRY," Listen, uh I just remembered... I’m... uh, getting a facial.",11
3778,ELAINE," Oh, see you tomorrow morning.",11
3779,JERRY," No, I don’t eat dinner. Dinner’s for suckers.",11
3780,JERRY," Uh huh... Yeah... Okay, thanks anyway... Bye.",11
3781,JERRY," Nope, the cop says it’s my word against his. There’s nothing they can do.",11
3782,KRAMER, Let’s go get him.,11
3783,JERRY," Yeah, right.",11
3784,GEORGE, We can’t just let him get away with this.,11
3785,JERRY," Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know it’s missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He’s crazy.",11
3786,KRAMER, You wanna go get him?,11
3787,ELAINE," Well, then, if he’s crazy you should just forget it.",11
3788,GEORGE, Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mother’s making her roasted potatoes!,11
3789,ELAINE," George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?",11
3790,GEORGE, Who is this Rava?,11
3791,KRAMER, I say we get him.,11
3792,ELAINE, No!,11
3793,GEORGE, Let me just call him.,11
3794,JERRY," I’ll call him.  Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Rava’s friend, Elaine’s friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady?  Would you shut up?!  Yeah, you don’t want to talk about it over the phone?.. You don’t want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monk’s?... All right, tomorrow... One o’ clock... Great, okay, bye.",11
3795,ELAINE," All right, look, look, look. Let’s say he stole it.",11
3796,GEORGE," Oh, he stole it!",11
3797,ELAINE," C’mon, you can’t do anything about it. The cops won’t do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why don’t you just forget it?",11
3798,GEORGE, I thought you said one o’clock.,11
3799,JERRY," Relax, he’s late. He’s always late. It’s part of his M.O.",11
3800,GEORGE," Remember, don’t take any crap.",11
3801,JERRY," Yeah, yeah. Don’t worry about it.",11
3802,GEORGE, I’ll be right here.,11
3803,JERRY, That’s comforting. Shh. He’s coming.  Ray?,11
3804,JERRY," Well, I didn’t...",11
3805,GEORGE,  I wonder why.,11
3806,JERRY," Well, just give it back, and I won’t say anything.",11
3807,JERRY, Yeah.,11
3808,JERRY, What are you talking about?,11
3809,GEORGE, What is he talking about?,11
3810,JERRY," Yeah, me too.",11
3811,JERRY, Me.,11
3812,GEORGE," Yeah, him.",11
3813,JERRY, Yeah. Me.,11
3814,GEORGE, You already got it.,11
3815,JERRY," Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house – and then I saw it in your house.",11
3816,JERRY, What am I saying?,11
3817,GEORGE, Take a wild guess.,11
3818,GEORGE, What a mind.,11
3819,JERRY," Well, I...",11
3820,JERRY, I can’t believe what I’m hearing.,11
3821,GEORGE, I can’t believe what I’m hearing.,11
3822,GEORGE, Pawn shop?,11
3823,JERRY, A pawn shop?,11
3824,GEORGE, Cleaning them out.,11
3825,JERRY," Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.",11
3826,GEORGE, Again with the Rava.,11
3827,JERRY," No, she’s a little too cheery for me.",11
3828,JERRY, I know Finland. They’re neutral.,11
3829,JERRY," No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...",11
3830,GEORGE," “Oh, I find you so charming.” You wuss.",11
3831,JERRY,  Did you call me a wuss?,11
3832,JERRY, I said luss. I’m at a luss.,11
3833,JERRY," That’s not necessary.  You know, maybe it’s not that bad an idea.",11
3834,GEORGE, Singapore?! Do you hear this?,11
3835,GEORGE, That’s it! That’s it! I can’t take it. I can’t take it anymore! You stole the statue! You’re a theif! You’re a liar!,11
3836,JERRY, George...,11
3837,GEORGE," I’m the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!",11
3838,GEORGE, GUILTY!,11
3839,GEORGE," Oh, I’m crazy!",11
3840,JERRY," George, george...",11
3841,GEORGE," Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrar’s office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!",11
3842,GEORGE, You mean alias.,11
3843,GEORGE," Well, that was bound to happen.",11
3844,JERRY," Hey, Ray.",11
3845,JERRY, How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!,11
3846,ELAINE, Nervous?,11
3847,ELAINE, Yeah. Right.,11
3848,ELAINE, The book is great. Did you go out last night?,11
3849,ELAINE, They all are.,11
3850,ELAINE, I can’t remember.,11
3851,ELAINE," Oh, well, I’m staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.",11
3852,ELAINE," Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence...",11
3853,ELAINE," Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it’s gone and it’s in your apartment.",11
3854,ELAINE," No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.",11
3855,ELAINE, A big coincidence.,11
3856,ELAINE," No, that’s a big coincidence.",11
3857,ELAINE," No, there are degrees of coincidences.",11
3858,ELAINE, Shouldn’t you be out on a ledge somewhere?,11
3859,GEORGE," Ma, will you stop?... It’s just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didn’t even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I don’t see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye.  She doesn’t react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.",11
3860,KRAMER, I’m not happy about this.,11
3861,ELAINE, Why don’t we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?,11
3862,GEORGE," There’s just no justice. This experience has changed me. It’s made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.",11
3863,JERRY, Really?,11
3864,GEORGE,"  Sure, why not.",11
3865,ELAINE," Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.",11
3866,JERRY, Can’t you talk to your boss?,11
3867,ELAINE," I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think you’re funny at all.",11
3868,KRAMER,  I’m not happy about this.,11
3869,JERRY," Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..",11
3870,GEORGE," Yeah, he’ll have my parents.",11
3871,KRAMER,  Police! Open up!,11
3872,KRAMER," Freeze, mother!",11
3873,KRAMER," Shut up. Spread ‘em. I said spread ‘em!  You’re in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder.",11
3874,KRAMER," Shut up! Keep ‘em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!",11
3875,KRAMER, Is your name Ray?,11
3876,KRAMER," Yeah, you’re the punk I’m looking for!",11
3877,KRAMER," Yeah, I’m a cop. I’m a good cop. I’m a damn good cop!  Today’s your lucky day, junior, ‘cause I’m gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and you’ll be sorry. You got me?",11
3878,KRAMER," Good, good. Let’s uh keep it that way.",11
3879,JERRY," All right, all right. What’s the big hubbub, bub?",11
3880,GEORGE," Kramer, I can’t believe it. Oh, you’re my hero!",11
3881,KRAMER, Yeah.,11
3882,JERRY," Kramer, what did you do?",11
3883,KRAMER," Well, let’s just say I didn’t take him to People’s Court.",11
3884,GEORGE," I feel like a huge weight’s been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I don’t know how to thank you!",11
3885,KRAMER," Well, I’ll think of something.",11
3886,JERRY," People are going to steal from you. You can’t stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, who’s gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They can’t get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.",11
3887,JERRY,"  Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's ""Beaches"" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.",110
3888,JERRY," She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was ""Beaches"" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?",110
3889,GEORGE, Where were you?,110
3890,JERRY, I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.,110
3891,GEORGE," Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.",110
3892,JERRY, Of course.,110
3893,GEORGE," When you're talking about a movie like ""Beaches"", moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage.",110
3894,JERRY," yeah,",110
3895,KRAMER, Hey.,110
3896,GEORGE, Hey. I gotta go.,110
3897,KRAMER, Where you going?,110
3898,JERRY," The Improv is playing ""Rochelle Rochelle"" The musical.",110
3899,KRAMER, Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?,110
3900,JERRY, She might be. She's the star of the show.,110
3901,KRAMER," Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.",110
3902,GEORGE, I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.,110
3903,KRAMER," So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe.",110
3904,GEORGE, Gennice palying today?,110
3905,JERRY," Yeah, maybe.",110
3906,KRAMER, Who's Gennice?,110
3907,JERRY, That's the understudy. I'm dating her.,110
3908,KRAMER," Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?",110
3909,JERRY, Yeah.,110
3910,KRAMER," Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world.",110
3911,JERRY, I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.,110
3912,GEORGE, Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.,110
3913,JERRY, Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thing…real bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.,110
3914,ELAINE, I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus,110
3915,ELAINE, How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.,110
3916,ELAINE," What?, uh?",110
3917,ELAINE, What is so funny?,110
3918,ELAINE, The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.,110
3919,JERRY, How would you know? You don't speak Korean.,110
3920,ELAINE, Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at me…ge ge ge,110
3921,KRAMER," You know, maybe in Korean ""dog"" isn't an insult. Could be like the word ""fox"" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!",110
3922,JERRY, Why don't you go to another nail shop?,110
3923,ELAINE," Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.",110
3924,JERRY, What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.,110
3925,ELAINE," Yeah, who speaks Korean?",110
3926,JERRY, You know who speaks Korean?,110
3927,ELAINE," No, who?",110
3928,JERRY, George's father.,110
3929,ELAINE, You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?,110
3930,JERRY, He used to go there a lot on business.,110
3931,ELAINE, What did he do?,110
3932,JERRY," He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.",110

4031,JERRY, And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.,111

4152,GEORGE, You like that?,111
4153,JERRY," And she said ""Yes""?",111

4160,GEORGE, You what?,111
4161,JERRY," Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. But she scooped them.",111
4162,GEORGE, . . . she scooped her niblets?,111
4163,JERRY, Yes. That's what was so vexing.,111
4164,GEORGE, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What about the pact?,111
4165,JERRY, What?,111
4166,GEORGE, What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. Did you not shake my hand on it uh?,111
4167,JERRY," You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.",111
4168,GEORGE," Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...",111
4169,JERRY, You thought I was gonna get married?,111
4170,GEORGE," Well, maybe not married, but...",111
4171,JERRY," I mean, you love Susan, right?",111

4190,ELAINE, KRAMER,111
4191,KRAMER," Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor.",111
4192,ELAINE, Yeah. That's him.,111

4195,JERRY," Oh, how come?",111
4196,GEORGE," Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.",111

4200,GEORGE," She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart.",111
4201,JERRY," Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good.",111
4202,GEORGE, Yeah. see you later.,111
4203,JERRY," Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex.",111
4204,GEORGE, I am ready.,111
4205,GEORGE," Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.",111
4206,JERRY, Yeah.,111
4207,GEORGE, Okay.,111

4209,KRAMER," Oh, no. I don't wear a watch.",111
4210,ELAINE, What do you do?,111
4211,KRAMER," Well, I tell time by the sun.",111
4212,ELAINE, How close do you get?,111
4213,KRAMER," Well, I can guess within an hour.",111
4214,ELAINE," Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun.",111
4215,KRAMER, Yeah.,111
4216,ELAINE," Well, what about at night? What do you do then?",111
4217,KRAMER," Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours.",111
4218,KRAMER, You got it?,111
4219,ELAINE, Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?,111
4220,ELAINE, But he's so small.,111
4221,ELAINE, That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?,111
4222,ELAINE, How could that be the dog?,111
4223,KRAMER," Well, get him to bark.",111
4224,ELAINE, Yeah. Yeah. I'll know if he barks.,111
4225,ELAINE, Bark.,111
4226,GEORGE," Yes, it was very, very good.",111
4227,GEORGE," Oh, I sure hope so.",111
4228,JERRY," How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?",111
4229,JERRY," Oh, man!",111
4230,KRAMER, Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.,111
4231,ELAINE, You think we're far enough.,111
4232,KRAMER," Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's.",111

4239,JERRY," Oh, Mattingly just singled .",111
4240,GEORGE," You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.",111
4241,JERRY, I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.,111
4242,GEORGE," Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.",111
4243,JERRY, We come from the same place.,111
4244,GEORGE, I got to go.,111
4245,ELAINE, No! No! It's impossible. It's impossible.,111
4246,ELAINE," I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.",111
4247,JERRY, Very strange.,111
4248,ELAINE, I know.,111
4249,JERRY," So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?",111
4250,ELAINE," Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.",111
4251,JERRY, All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.,111
4252,ELAINE, News? What news?,111
4253,JERRY, Sorry!,111
4254,ELAINE, What? What?,111
4255,JERRY," All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.",111
4256,ELAINE," Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!",111
4257,JERRY, George Costanza...,111
4258,ELAINE, Yeah?,111
4259,JERRY, Is getting married!,111
4260,ELAINE, Get out!,111
4261,KRAMER, Hi.,111
4262,KRAMER," Uh, yes. Yeah.",111
4263,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, that's...",111
4264,KRAMER, What?,111
4265,KRAMER, Arrest?,111
4266,JERRY, Newman.,111
4267,KRAMER," Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?",111
4268,ELAINE, I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?,111
4269,ELAINE," Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.",112
4270,JERRY, Really? What happened?,112
4271,ELAINE," Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.",112
4272,JERRY, Isn't he the one with the show on cable?,112
4273,ELAINE," Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.",112
4274,JERRY, That's great.,112
4275,ELAINE, I know.,112
4276,JERRY, That looks pretty good.,112
4277,ELAINE, He's in.,112
4278,JERRY," Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.",112
4279,ELAINE, What's to discuss?,112
4280,JERRY, Come on! GEORGE,112
4281,ELAINE, Is he happy?,112
4282,GEORGE, I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?,112
4283,GEORGE, Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?,112
4284,GEORGE, A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.,112
4285,GEORGE, Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?,112
4286,GEORGE, It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.,112
4287,GEORGE,  How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.,112
4288,JERRY," Yeah, he seems pretty happy.",112
4289,ELAINE," Well, that's all that counts, I guess.",112
4290,JERRY, What's the matter?,112
4291,ELAINE," Oh, nothin'.",112
4292,JERRY," Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.",112
4293,ELAINE," Well, what do you want me to do?",112
4294,JERRY," Well, at least have some reaction to it.",112
4295,ELAINE," …Well, I don't.",112
4296,JERRY, Maybe you're a little jealous.,112
4297,ELAINE," Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?",112
4298,JERRY," No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.",112
4299,ELAINE," Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.",112
4300,JERRY," Oh, yeah. Right.",112
4301,ELAINE," Yeah, right.",112
4302,JERRY, Lainy!,112
4303,ELAINE, Jerry!,112
4304,JERRY, You don't wanna get married?,112
4305,ELAINE," Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.",112
4306,JERRY," Oh, come on!",112
4307,ELAINE," Oh, you come on.",112
4308,JERRY, You're such...,112
4309,KRAMER," Oh, hey!",112
4310,JERRY, Hey.,112
4311,KRAMER," Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?",112
4312,ELAINE," Oh, dear.",112
4313,KRAMER," It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?",112
4314,JERRY, We're gonna change the system.,112
4315,KRAMER, Yes!,112
4316,ELAINE," Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.",112
4317,ELAINE," Oh, hello, Rabbi Krischma.",112
4318,ELAINE, Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.,112
4319,ELAINE," Yeah, I suppose.",112
4320,ELAINE," No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.",112
4321,JERRY, Hey!,112
4322,GEORGE, I want your honest opinion about something.,112
4323,JERRY, Have I ever been less than forthright?,112
4324,GEORGE," No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.",112
4325,JERRY," Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?",112
4326,GEORGE," All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea",112
4327,JERRY, Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.,112
4328,GEORGE," It's good, right?",112
4329,JERRY, I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.,112
4330,GEORGE, You do?,112
4331,JERRY," Yes, I do.",112
4332,GEORGE," Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.",112
4333,JERRY, Hmm.,112
4334,GEORGE," Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, ""Can we change the subject?""",112
4335,JERRY," See, now that I don't care for.",112
4336,GEORGE," Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?",112
4337,JERRY, It should resolve of its own volition.,112
4338,GEORGE," That's exactly what I said, except I used the word ""momentum"".",112
4339,JERRY, Momentum - same thing.,112
4340,GEORGE," Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?",112
4341,JERRY," Yeah, I know.",112
4342,GEORGE," Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.",112
4343,JERRY, You're turning.,112
4344,GEORGE," Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.",112
4345,JERRY," If you need more time, you should have more time.",112
4346,GEORGE," What, you think I could postpone it?",112
4347,JERRY, Sure you can. Why not?,112
4348,GEORGE, That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?,112
4349,JERRY, I don't see why not.,112
4350,GEORGE," So, I could do that?",112
4351,JERRY," Sure, go ahead.",112
4352,GEORGE," All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.",112
4353,JERRY, Spring. Of course.,112
4354,GEORGE, Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.,112
4355,JERRY, Beautiful.,112
4356,GEORGE, She's not gonna like it.,112
4357,JERRY," No, she's not.",112
4358,GEORGE," You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.",112
4359,JERRY," Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.",112
4360,GEORGE," Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.",112
4361,JERRY," Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.",112
4362,KRAMER," Hey, hey.",112
4363,GEORGE," March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?",112
4364,JERRY," Oh, all the way.",112
4365,GEORGE, You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.,112
4366,JERRY, Is that so?,112
4367,JERRY," Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?",112
4368,KRAMER, Definitely.,112
4369,JERRY, You're kidding?,112
4370,KRAMER," No, no, I would turn you in.",112
4371,JERRY, You would turn me in?,112
4372,KRAMER," Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it.",112
4373,JERRY, I can't believe your a friend of mine.,112
4374,KRAMER, What kind of person are you going around killing people?,112
4375,JERRY," Well, I am sure I had a good reason.",112
4376,KRAMER," Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?",112
4377,JERRY, But you know me!,112
4378,KRAMER, I thought I DID!,112
4379,ELAINE, I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.,112
4380,ELAINE," Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .",112
4381,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.",112
4382,ELAINE," No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.",112
4383,ELAINE," Yeah, I don't know what that means.",112
4384,ELAINE," You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.",112
4385,ELAINE," No, no, it's okay.",112
4386,ELAINE, I don't think so.,112
4387,JERRY, So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.,112
4388,KRAMER," Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.",112
4389,JERRY, Another Café Latte?,112

4392,JERRY," Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Café Latte?",112
4393,JERRY, I don't recall you drinking Café Latte.,112
4394,KRAMER, I've been drinking Café Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.,112
4395,JERRY," Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.",112
4396,KRAMER, I've always wanted to see this.,112
4397,JERRY, You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.,112
4398,KRAMER," Well, yeah, lets do it uh?",112
4399,JERRY," Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.",112
4400,JERRY, Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.,112
4401,KRAMER, Maybe I will.,112
4402,GEORGE," Hi,",112
4403,GEORGE," Good, good day. How was your day?",112
4404,GEORGE," Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.",112
4405,GEORGE," The Lowers, really?",112
4406,GEORGE," No, I want to go.",112
4407,GEORGE," Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!",112
4408,GEORGE," Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?",112
4409,GEORGE," Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.",112
4410,GEORGE," No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the …",112
4411,GEORGE," Still marry , still marry.",112
4412,GEORGE, Sstill love. Still love.,112
4413,GEORGE," No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I …It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.",112
4414,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.",112
4415,JERRY, Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.,112
4416,GEORGE, How did you know that?,112
4417,JERRY, I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.,112
4418,GEORGE, I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.,112
4419,JERRY," tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.",112
4420,GEORGE, You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.,112
4421,JERRY," Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.",112
4422,GEORGE, I didn't have any sex.,112
4423,JERRY, You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.,112
4424,GEORGE, I didn't have make-up sex.,112
4425,JERRY, In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.,112
4426,GEORGE," Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!",112
4427,GEORGE, Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.,112
4428,GEORGE, This is amazing.  Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better ,112
4429,JERRY, . . . Poor bastard.,112
4430,JERRY," Good evening, Rabbi.",112
4431,JERRY," Well, Rabbi, well.",112
4432,JERRY," Yeah, that's right.",112
4433,JERRY, What do you mean?,112
4434,JERRY, No.,112
4435,JERRY, is that so?,112
4436,JERRY, Really?,112
4437,JERRY, I didn't know any of this.,112
4438,JERRY," Hum, well it all comes as news to me.",112
4439,GEORGE,  Hi.,112
4440,GEORGE," Good, good day. How was your day?",112
4441,GEORGE," Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?",112
4442,GEORGE," You see this is the thing. . . .  I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, ",112
4443,GEORGE, Yeah?,112
4444,GEORGE, All right. ,112
4445,ELAINE, I've got that magazine article for you.,112
4446,JERRY, You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.,112
4447,ELAINE, Are you,112
4448,JERRY, Understand you had a little talk with him too.,112
4449,ELAINE," Yeah, talked earlier.",112
4450,JERRY," Yes I know, I know.",112
4451,ELAINE,. . . What does that mean?,112
4452,JERRY," Nothing, nothing.",112
4453,ELAINE, He didn't mention . . .,112
4454,JERRY, Yes he did.,112
4455,ELAINE, He told you about our conversation?,112
4456,JERRY, We had quite a little chat.,112
4457,ELAINE, He told you about . . .,112
4458,JERRY," Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.",112
4459,ELAINE, He told you all that? How could he?,112
4460,JERRY," It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.",112
4461,ELAINE, Can he do that?,112
4462,JERRY, He did it.,112
4463,ELAINE, But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?,112
4464,JERRY, That's what's so fascinating.,112
4465,JERRY, You better finish your little café latte there. They won't let you in with it.,112
4466,KRAMER, Why not?,112
4467,JERRY, Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.,112
4468,KRAMER, Well that's stupid,112
4469,JERRY, That's the rule.,112
4470,KRAMER," Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.",112
4471,ELAINE, Yeah…,112
4472,ELAINE," No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?",112
4473,ELAINE," Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?",112
4474,ELAINE, Mrs. Winston?,112
4475,ELAINE, What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?,112
4476,ELAINE," You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.",112
4477,ELAINE," my god, you didn't.",112
4478,JERRY," Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me",112
4479,KRAMER," Oh, yow, oow Ah!",112
4480,KRAMER, Nothing Nothing.,112
4481,KRAMER, I don't have anything. Ask him.,112
4482,KRAMER, What?!,112
4483,KRAMER, Ow,112
4484,ELAINE, But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.,112
4485,JERRY," Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.",112
4486,ELAINE," You didn't say this to George, did you?",112
4487,JERRY," No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?",112
4488,ELAINE," Yeah that! So, . . .",112
4489,GEORGE, Hey oh.,112
4490,ELAINE," GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.",112
4491,GEORGE," Alright, thanks a lot.",112
4492,ELAINE," Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.",112
4493,GEORGE," Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...",112
4494,ELAINE," Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.",112
4495,GEORGE," Well, I guess I'm getting older.",112
4496,ELAINE," Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.",112
4497,GEORGE, Yeah.,112
4498,ELAINE," My most, just heartfelt congratulations.",112
4499,GEORGE," Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.",112
4500,ELAINE," Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.",112
4501,GEORGE," Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.",112
4502,ELAINE," Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.",112
4503,GEORGE," Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?",112
4504,JERRY," Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh…",112
4505,GEORGE, Nope. I wept like a baby.,112
4506,JERRY, What?,112
4507,GEORGE," Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.",112
4508,JERRY, You cried?,112
4509,GEORGE," I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.",112
4510,JERRY, Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.,112
4511,KRAMER," Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.",112
4512,JERRY, Suing? What for?,112
4513,KRAMER, The coffee was too hot.,112
4514,JERRY, It's supposed to be hot.,112
4515,KRAMER, Not THAT hot.,112
4516,GEORGE, Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.,112
4517,GEORGE," And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.",113
4518,ELAINE," I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.",113
4519,GEORGE," Ya know, I was just a little surprised.",113
4520,JERRY, Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?,113
4521,GEORGE, What about all the loser stuff?,113
4522,ELAINE," I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said ""I've never seen you looser"".",113
4523,JERRY," I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.",113
4524,GEORGE,"  Well, scintillating as always.",113
4525,JERRY, Where you going?,113
4526,GEORGE, I'm going shopping with Susan.,113
4527,ELAINE, What kind of shopping?,113
4528,GEORGE, Clothes shopping.,113
4529,ELAINE, Where are you going?,113
4530,GEORGE, Ross'.,113
4531,ELAINE, Oh that's a nice store.,113
4532,GEORGE," Yeah, it's her uncle's.",113
4533,JERRY, Discount?,113
4534,GEORGE,  One would hope.,113
4535,KRAMER," So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte.",113
4536,KRAMER, Yeah that's right.,113
4537,KRAMER, Yeah.,113
4538,KRAMER, Yes I did.,113
4539,KRAMER, No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.,113
4540,KRAMER, Well I think I take a normal sip.,113
4541,KRAMER," Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.",113
4542,KRAMER," Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?",113
4543,KRAMER, It's definitely preposterous.,113
4544,KRAMER, Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.,113
4545,KRAMER, Yeah.,113
4546,KRAMER, No. They put the top on.,113
4547,KRAMER," Ah No no, I haven't.",113
4548,KRAMER," So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.",113
4549,KRAMER," Jackie. I mean, we have a chance?",113
4550,GEORGE," I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.",113
4551,GEORGE, All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.,113
4552,GEORGE, See now this I don't get.,113
4553,GEORGE, The security guard.,113
4554,GEORGE, Why does he have to stand?,113
4555,GEORGE, But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.,113
4556,GEORGE, Aren't you concerned about the security guard?,113
4557,GEORGE,  She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.,113
4558,JERRY," So ah, what did you do last night?",113
4559,ELAINE, Nothing.,113
4560,JERRY," I know nothing, but what did you actually do?",113
4561,ELAINE, Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.,113
4562,JERRY, Wow. That really is nothing.,113
4563,ELAINE, I told ya.,113
4564,KRAMER, Hey.,113
4565,JERRY, Hey.,113
4566,ELAINE, Hey.,113
4567,JERRY, What are you all dressed up for?,113
4568,KRAMER, Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.,113
4569,JERRY," Oh yeah, how's that looking?",113
4570,KRAMER," Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury,  I'm gonna be a rich man.",113
4571,ELAINE, That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.,113
4572,KRAMER," Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.",113
4573,JERRY, Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.,113
4574,KRAMER, Oh I can be quite litigious.,113
4575,ELAINE, What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.,113
4576,KRAMER, Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.,113
4577,ELAINE,  Jackie says the top was faulty.,113
4578,KRAMER, Hey Maestro!,113
4579,KRAMER, I'm in here. How's it going.,113
4580,JERRY, Hi Bob.,113
4581,JERRY,"  Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro.",113
4582,KRAMER," Well, this is a surprise ha?",113
4583,KRAMER," Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?",113
4584,KRAMER," Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.",113
4585,KRAMER, Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.,113
4586,JERRY, I hear it's ah beautiful there.,113
4587,JERRY,  Huh?,113
4588,ELAINE, Hello.,113
4589,ELAINE, I might be Elaine.,113
4590,JERRY," This is a, Bob Cobb.",113
4591,KRAMER, Maestro.,113
4592,ELAINE," Oh, Maestro.",113
4593,ELAINE, Enchante.,113
4594,ELAINE, Well I have to be going.,113
4595,ELAINE, Jinx buy me a coke.,113
4596,ELAINE, I know I know. That is so ahh ......,113
4597,ELAINE," Yeah, thanks. O.K. Bye you guys.",113
4598,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.",113
4599,KRAMER, You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.,113
4600,JERRY," Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?",113
4601,KRAMER, That's right.,113
4602,JERRY, Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.,113
4603,KRAMER, Why?,113
4604,JERRY, Because it's a stupid thing to be called.,113
4605,KRAMER, Jerry he's a conductor.,113
4606,JERRY, Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.,113
4607,KRAMER," Well, he's still a conductor.",113
4608,JERRY, Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.,113
4609,KRAMER," Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.",113
4610,JERRY, New shirt?,113
4611,GEORGE, Yeah. You like it.,113
4612,JERRY," No, not particularly.",113
4613,GEORGE," Why, the color?",113
4614,JERRY, Yeah.,113
4615,GEORGE, Too flashy?,113
4616,JERRY," Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?",113
4617,GEORGE,  No.,113
4618,JERRY,  All right what's it going to be here.,113
4619,GEORGE," Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?",113
4620,JERRY, No.,113
4621,GEORGE," See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.",113
4622,JERRY, Are you sensing anything right now?,113
4623,GEORGE," Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?",113
4624,JERRY," Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.",113
4625,GEORGE," What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this.  Here, watch.  Criminals. Boom. I'm up.  Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!",113
4626,JERRY, Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.,113
4627,GEORGE, Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.,113
4628,JERRY, I know you will.,113
4629,KRAMER," Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.",113
4630,GEORGE, Who?,113
4631,JERRY, His lawyer.,113
4632,KRAMER," Yeah, Java World wants to settle.",113
4633,JERRY, What?,113
4634,KRAMER," Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.",113
4635,JERRY, Why are they settling?,113
4636,KRAMER, Cause their afraid of bad publicity.,113
4637,JERRY, All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?,113
4638,KRAMER, Yeah that's right.,113
4639,GEORGE,  I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!,113
4640,ELAINE, Uh ha.,113
4641,ELAINE, Oh God. What are you getting Bob?,113
4642,ELAINE, Excuse me?,113
4643,ELAINE," Yeah, so?",113
4644,ELAINE," Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.",113
4645,ELAINE, Maestro huh? O.K. ,113
4646,KRAMER, Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look..,113
4647,JERRY, What do you mean?,113
4648,KRAMER," Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it.",113
4649,JERRY, So?,113
4650,KRAMER, So? My lawsuit. I'm finished.,113
4651,JERRY, I thought they wanted to settle.,113
4652,KRAMER, Well what happens if they want to see it?,113
4653,JERRY, Then you're in a lot of trouble.,113
4654,KRAMER, Yeah!!,113
4655,GEORGE,  Tired?,113
4656,GEORGE," How come uh, no chair?",113
4657,GEORGE," I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.",113
4658,GEORGE," No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?",113
4659,GEORGE, Would you like a chair?,113
4660,GEORGE," Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?",113
4661,GEORGE, That's exactly my point.,113
4662,GEORGE," Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down.  That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.",113
4663,KRAMER, I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?,113
4664,KRAMER, The Maestro.,113
4665,KRAMER, My friend he's a conductor.,113
4666,KRAMER, Well my stomach was burning.,113
4667,KRAMER, Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.,113
4668,KRAMER, Well I ...,113
4669,KRAMER, I'm sorry Jackie.,113
4670,KRAMER,"  Yeah, get over.",113
4671,JERRY, Did you have a good time?,113
4672,ELAINE," Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.",113
4673,JERRY,"  Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.",113
4674,ELAINE, Really?,113
4675,JERRY," So what about the ""Maestro"" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.",113
4676,ELAINE," Yeah, I called him Maestro.",113
4677,JERRY, You didn't mind?,113
4678,ELAINE," Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.",113
4679,JERRY," O.K. from now on I want you to call me ""Jerry the Great"".",113
4680,ELAINE," I am not calling you ""Jerry the Great"".",113
4681,JERRY, Why not you call him Maestro.,113
4682,ELAINE, He is a Maestro.,113
4683,JERRY," Well, I'm great.",113
4684,ELAINE, So you say.,113
4685,JERRY," What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?",113
4686,ELAINE, Yeah.  I'm invited.,113
4687,JERRY," You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.",113
4688,ELAINE, Why?,113
4689,JERRY, I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.,113
4690,ELAINE," Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.",113
4691,JERRY, In all of Tuscany? I wonder.,113
4692,KRAMER,  I'LL TAKE IT!!,113
4693,KRAMER, No.,113
4694,KRAMER, Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.,113
4695,KRAMER, Yeah.,113
4696,KRAMER, Well I didn't hear any Plus.,113
4697,KRAMER," Look, Java World.  Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte.",113
4698,ELAINE, Hey. Hi Maestro.,113
4699,ELAINE, Yeah.,113
4700,JERRY, Hey you know we were just talking about you.,113
4701,JERRY," Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?",113
4702,JERRY, No. I'm not really looking.,113
4703,JERRY, So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?,113
4704,JERRY," I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?",113
4705,ELAINE, It's BOOKED Jerry!,113
4706,JERRY, How'd you get yours?,113
4707,JERRY, Maybe I'll check out France.,113
4708,JERRY," Hey George, do you believe this guy?",113
4709,GEORGE, Who?,113
4710,JERRY, Bob Cobb.,113
4711,GEORGE, Bob Cobb?,113
4712,JERRY," You know, the Maestro.",113
4713,GEORGE, Oh I missed the Maestro?,113
4714,JERRY," Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.",113
4715,GEORGE, Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?,113
4716,JERRY, No.,113
4717,GEORGE, So what do you care?,113
4718,JERRY, I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.,113
4719,GEORGE, Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?,113
4720,JERRY, I have no idea.,113
4721,GEORGE, It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.,113
4722,JERRY," Oh, no way it's that big.",113
4723,GEORGE, It's a big region.,113
4724,JERRY, Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?,113
4725,GEORGE, I don't know why I bother even talking to you.,113
4726,JERRY," Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.",113
4727,GEORGE, All right.,113
4728,GEORGE, So I spoke to the security guard.,113
4729,JERRY, Yeah and?,113
4730,GEORGE," Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.",113
4731,JERRY, So are you gonna get him a chair?,113
4732,GEORGE, Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.,113
4733,JERRY," Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.",113
4734,GEORGE, Oh I think I'd go for the back.,113
4735,JERRY, Swivel?,113
4736,GEORGE, I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.,113
4737,JERRY, I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.,113
4738,GEORGE, You mean one of those vinyl things?,113
4739,JERRY, Yes.,113
4740,GEORGE," Vinyl yeah, maybe.",113
4741,JERRY, How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.,113
4742,GEORGE," Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.",113
4743,JERRY," Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.",113
4744,GEORGE, What do you think about a rocking chair?,113
4745,KRAMER,"  You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.",113
4746,JERRY," Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?",113
4747,KRAMER," Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.",113
4748,JERRY, That's it?,113
4749,KRAMER," That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.",113
4750,JERRY, You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.,113
4751,KRAMER, Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.,113
4752,JERRY, You're racing!,113
4753,KRAMER, Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.,113
4754,ELAINE,  Oh Bob! Bob!,113
4755,ELAINE,  Maestro!,113
4756,GEORGE," Nope. Just a, giving a chair to the security guard.",113
4757,GEORGE, What's your name?,113
4758,GEORGE, I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.,113
4759,GEORGE, Innocent mistake.,113
4760,GEORGE," Well, here you go. What do you think?",113
4761,GEORGE," Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.",113
4762,JERRY," Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.",113
4763,JERRY, Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.,113
4764,JERRY," Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?",113
4765,JERRY," Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?",113
4766,JERRY, I didn't actually want to rent it.,113
4767,JERRY," So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.",113
4768,ELAINE," It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.",113
4769,ELAINE, You're right Maestro.,113
4770,KRAMER," Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.",113
4771,JERRY, You didn't have to push me.,113
4772,KRAMER, I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?,113
4773,JERRY," 75,000 lira.",113
4774,KRAMER," 75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?",113
4775,JERRY, Kramer you don't under the conversion rate.,113
4776,KRAMER," Oh, conversion rate, oh.",113
4777,JERRY, You know I don't even know why I brought you.,113
4778,KRAMER, Nobody put a gun to your head.,113
4779,JERRY, Not bad!,113
4780,KRAMER, Yeah!,113
4781,ELAINE, Hello,114
4782,ELAINE," Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.",114
4783,ELAINE, I wish.,114
4784,ELAINE," Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.",114
4785,ELAINE," Oh, all right, James. He he he",114
4786,GEORGE, Your wake up guy asked you out?,114
4787,ELAINE," Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,",114
4788,JERRY, I don't know. Blind date?,114
4789,ELAINE, What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.,114
4790,JERRY," Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.",114
4791,ELAINE, At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.,114
4792,JERRY, I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.,114
4793,ELAINE," Ah, . . .",114
4794,GEORGE, Now you're off on a topic.,114
4795,JERRY," You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.",114
4796,ELAINE, Uh hu.,114
4797,JERRY, Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.,114
4798,GEORGE, You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.,114
4799,ELAINE, I think she'd figure it out.,114
4800,ELAINE, What? What is this?,114
4801,JERRY, Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.,114
4802,ELAINE, Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?,114
4803,JERRY, A healthy person.,114
4804,GEORGE,"  Ow, Ow you squirted me.",114
4805,JERRY," Oh, sorry",114
4806,GEORGE," Boy, it stings.",114
4807,GEORGE, No.,114
4808,GEORGE," No, not that I know of. ",114
4809,GEORGE, Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. ,114
4810,JERRY," I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.",114
4811,ELAINE, I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.,114
4812,JERRY, You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?,114
4813,ELAINE, I think I can tell.,114
4814,JERRY," Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?",114
4815,ELAINE, Twenty-five percent.,114
4816,JERRY," Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.",114
4817,ELAINE, You're way off.,114
4818,JERRY, Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.,114
4819,ELAINE, So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?,114
4820,JERRY, UNDATEABLE!,114
4821,ELAINE, Then how are all these people getting together?,114
4822,JERRY, Alcohol.,114
4823,ELAINE,  What is your problem?,114
4824,GEORGE, No problem here.,114
4825,ELAINE, You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.,114
4826,GEORGE, I had no idea.,114
4827,ELAINE, Right there. Right there. You just did it again.,114
4828,GEORGE, Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.,114
4829,ELAINE, You're eye still hurts?,114
4830,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.",114
4831,JERRY, Pulp couldn't make it across the table.,114
4832,GEORGE," Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?",114
4833,JERRY," Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.",114
4834,GEORGE, Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.,114
4835,ELAINE," What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?",114
4836,GEORGE," Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.",114
4837,KRAMER, Hi guys.,114
4838,JERRY," Hi,",114
4839,KRAMER," Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?",114
4840,GEORGE, Yeah.,114
4841,KRAMER, And Buck Showalter's?,114
4842,GEORGE, It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.,114
4843,KRAMER," Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.",114
4844,GEORGE," Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. ",114
4845,KRAMER," No, of course not. ",114
4846,KRAMER," You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.",114
4847,KRAMER, Why?,114
4848,GEORGE, Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?,114
4849,GEORGE, Birthday card?,114
4850,GEORGE," Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.",114
4851,GEORGE, Of course. Your massage.  Enjoy your massage. ,114
4852,ELAINE, Hello.,114
4853,ELAINE," James! Ah, ha, Hello! Phew!",114
4854,JERRY," Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.",114
4855,JERRY," Well, no, I'm not one of those.",114
4856,JERRY, Grandma Memma?,114
4857,JERRY," No, I think I would have remembered Memma.",114
4858,JERRY, What do you recommend besides the steak?,114
4859,JERRY, Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?,114
4860,JERRY, You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.,114
4861,JERRY,  Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?,114
4862,ELAINE," Oh, uh, ha, you've got dogs?",114

4867,GEORGE," Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.",114
4868,GEORGE," Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.",114
4869,GEORGE," Ah, not yet.",114
4870,GEORGE, Yes sir!,114
4871,ELAINE, I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.,114
4872,JERRY, Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?,114
4873,ELAINE, Huh huh.,114
4874,JERRY, Did she mention anything about our lunch?,114
4875,ELAINE," Uh, kind of.",114

4903,ELAINE," Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?",114
4904,ELAINE," Oh, I don't remember them.",114
4905,ELAINE, Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?,114

4916,JERRY," Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.",114

4918,ELAINE," What did you do, ransack the place after she died?",114
4919,JERRY, This is some FINE mutton.,114

4930,ELAINE, These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.,114
4931,JERRY, Why were dogs chasing you?,114
4932,ELAINE, They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.,114

4944,JERRY, It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.,114
4945,GEORGE," I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.",114
4946,ELAINE," Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.",114
4947,GEORGE, Napkins?,114
4948,ELAINE," I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.",114
4949,JERRY, Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.,114
4950,ELAINE, They were?,114
4951,JERRY, Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.,114
4952,ELAINE, Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.,114
4953,GEORGE, What exactly is mutton?,114
4954,JERRY, I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?,114
4955,ELAINE," Oh, I must have left it at Jame's",114
4956,JERRY, You spent the night at James's? Did we?,114
4957,ELAINE, Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.,114
4958,JERRY, Reversed positions?,114
4959,ELAINE," Yeah, you know, head to toe.",114
4960,JERRY, So what your genitals are still lined up.,114

4968,KRAMER, Two is better than one.,114
4969,KRAMER," Well, Babe Ruth did it.",114
4970,KRAMER," Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?",114
4971,KRAMER," Well, maybe I did overextend myself.",114
4972,KRAMER," It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?",114
4973,JERRY, Yeah. Come on up.,114

4979,JERRY, I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.,114
4980,JERRY, That is so Franco.,114
4981,KRAMER," You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.",114
4982,KRAMER," He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.",114
4983,KRAMER, Come on Come on!,114
4984,KRAMER, GO! GO!!,114
4985,KRAMER, An In The Park Home Run!,114
4986,KRAMER," All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way ",114
4987,KRAMER, Huh?,114
4988,KRAMER," Yeah, maybe not technically, but …",114
4989,KRAMER," Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!",114
4990,KRAMER," Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that …",114
4991,JERRY, I usually like mine with an angioplasty.,114
4992,ELAINE, You know something really stinks to high h… Holly! What are you doing here?,114
4993,JERRY, What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.,114
4994,ELAINE," I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.",114
4995,ELAINE, I didn't take your napkins.,114
4996,ELAINE, Ask Jerry.,114
4997,JERRY, We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.,114
4998,GEORGE," No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .",114
4999,KRAMER," Hi,",114
5000,KRAMER,"  Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.",114
5001,KRAMER, And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.,114
5002,ELAINE," Uh, this is,…",114
5003,JERRY," Hey, what happened to my jacket?",114
5004,JERRY," Uh, sometimes I use the sofa.",114
5005,GEORGE," You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?",114
5006,GEORGE," Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.",114
5007,GEORGE," Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.",114
5008,GEORGE," Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.",114
5009,GEORGE, I know.,114
5010,GEORGE, I know.,114
5011,GEORGE," That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .",114
5012,JERRY,"I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics. How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking: - How much did you lose by? - I don't even know...! It was like... now.now...now.now..now..was like, like... now..now..now...! It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!... And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver......gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.",115
5013,JERRY,  I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog.  Get this one,115
5014,GEORGE, This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.,115
5015,ELAINE, Yeah. What do you do all day?,115
5016,GEORGE, Not that much.,115
5017,ELAINE, uh-uh.,115
5018,JERRY, I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.,115
5019,GEORGE," Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.",115
5020,JERRY, How do you pull that off?,115
5021,GEORGE," I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... .",115
5022,ELAINE," Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!",115
5023,JERRY," Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!",115
5024,GEORGE, I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right.  Back to work. ,115
5025,ELAINE, ,115
5026,JERRY, So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?,115
5027,ELAINE," No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.",115
5028,JERRY, What marathon runner?,115
5029,ELAINE," You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...",115
5030,JERRY," Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!",115
5031,ELAINE," Yeah, that's him.",115
5032,JERRY," He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?",115
5033,ELAINE," Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. ",115
5034,JERRY, How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?,115
5035,ELAINE," Ah, I know. I know...!",115
5036,JERRY," I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...",115
5037,ELAINE," Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.",115
5038,JERRY, Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.,115
5039,ELAINE, What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.,115
5040,JERRY, You gotta wake him up!,115
5041,ELAINE, Eh...he'll get up...,115
5042,ELAINE," Hi, Judy.",115
5043,ELAINE, Fine. ,115
5044,JERRY, I've seen her in your building.,115
5045,ELAINE, Yeah.,115
5046,JERRY, I didn't know she was married.,115
5047,ELAINE,  She's not... and the guy just took off.  Don't say anything to anybody.,115
5048,JERRY, Whom I gonna tell?,115
5049,ELAINE," I know, it's just something you have to say...",115
5050,JERRY, He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?,115
5051,GEORGE, I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.,115
5052,JERRY, My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on.  Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.,115
5053,KRAMER, Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.,115
5054,JERRY, What do you do?,115
5055,KRAMER, I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and...  ...I get up!,115
5056,JERRY, Always works?,115
5057,KRAMER," It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.",115
5058,GEORGE, uh-uh. What's with the bucket?,115
5059,KRAMER," Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.",115
5060,JERRY, Hot tub?,115
5061,KRAMER," Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. ",115
5062,GEORGE, You put a hot tub... in your living room?,115
5063,KRAMER," Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! ",115
5064,GEORGE, Is that tolerable?,115
5065,KRAMER, Oh...it's tolerable...! ,115
5066,JERRY, Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?,115
5067,KRAMER," Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... ",115
5068,GEORGE, He uh...doesn't have any running water?,115
5069,JERRY, I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.,115
5070,ELAINE," Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.",115
5071,JERRY," Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you.",115
5072,JERRY, Sorry about the Olympics.,115
5073,ELAINE," Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.",115
5074,JERRY, Ah...catalog writer's block?,115
5075,ELAINE," Yeah, that's funny. ",115
5076,JERRY,"  So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?",115
5077,JERRY, AM/PM.,115
5078,JERRY, Ah...the volume.,115
5079,JERRY," Ah, separate knob.",115
5080,JERRY, Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.,115
5081,JERRY," Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.",115
5082,JERRY," Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?",115
5083,ELAINE, Jerry...,115
5084,JERRY, It's a simple question...,115
5085,ELAINE," I've got an alarm, ok?",115
5086,JERRY, That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?,115
5087,ELAINE, It works.,115
5088,JERRY, Elaine...,115
5089,ELAINE, It... works!,115
5090,GEORGE, Eh...come oooon...,115
5091,GEORGE, Well...I've got a lot to do!,115
5092,ELAINE, Hey. Sorry I'm late.,115
5093,JERRY, You're 40 minutes late. What happened?,115
5094,ELAINE, I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?,115
5095,JERRY, No.,115
5096,ELAINE, What?  What is the problem?,115
5097,JERRY," Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.",115
5098,ELAINE, uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?,115
5099,JERRY," Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!",115
5100,ELAINE, Oh are you?!,115
5101,JERRY, Yes I am.,115
5102,ELAINE," Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!",115
5103,JERRY," Yeah, I know that!",115
5104,ELAINE," Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!",115
5105,JERRY, I'm not talking about upside down.  I'm talking about waking him up!,115
5106,ELAINE," Hey, Jean-Paul.",115
5107,JERRY," Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?",115
5108,KRAMER,  What's burning?,115
5109,ELAINE," Oh!  My muffin!  Oh, shoot! ",115
5110,JERRY, What happened?,115
5111,ELAINE, Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.,115
5112,KRAMER, This was set for 2 minutes. See?,115
5113,ELAINE,  Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!,115
5114,ELAINE,"  Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.",115
5115,ELAINE,"  All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?",115
5116,JERRY, Yeah. I hope so ?!,115
5117,ELAINE, Oh that's cute! ,115
5118,JERRY," Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!",115
5119,KRAMER," Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.",115
5120,JERRY, I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.,115
5121,KRAMER," Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!",115
5122,KRAMER,  ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... ,115
5123,GEORGE,"  Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.",115
5124,GEORGE," Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah...",115
5125,GEORGE," Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost.",115
5126,GEORGE, Well...maybe not as much as this bastard...  I can hold my own! ,115
5127,JERRY," Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...",115
5128,JERRY," I'm saying ""get the hell outta there""! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!",115
5129,JERRY," These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! ",115
5130,GEORGE," Hey, you bastards.",115
5131,JERRY," Hey, how was the meeting?",115
5132,GEORGE, I really like those sons of bitches.,115
5133,JERRY, Sons of bitches?,115
5134,GEORGE," Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh...""boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!"" ",115
5135,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. ",115
5136,KRAMER, Heeeeey...,115
5137,JERRY, How many sweaters you got on?,115
5138,KRAMER," Oh...four.  Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.",115
5139,GEORGE, What's goin'on?,115
5140,KRAMER, I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!,115
5141,JERRY, Your core temperature?,115
5142,KRAMER,"  Here, feel my hand.  Yeah, feel.",115
5143,GEORGE, Hello?,115
5144,GEORGE,"  Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?",115
5145,GEORGE, What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?,115
5146,GEORGE, Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!,115
5147,GEORGE, You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.,115
5148,GEORGE,  You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!,115
5149,GEORGE, Mr.Wilhelm...,115
5150,GEORGE, Well I-I...,115
5151,ELAINE,"  It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu...  Oh! This stinks!  Oh, come on... come on...!...God! ",115
5152,GEORGE, Whoa...it's like a furnace in here!,115
5153,JERRY, Oh whatta hell is goin'on?!,115
5154,KRAMER," Yeah, I turned up the heat.",115
5155,JERRY, Turn up the heat in your apartment! ,115
5156,KRAMER, I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.,115
5157,GEORGE, Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?,115
5158,KRAMER, Uh? Oh that must be it.,115
5159,GEORGE, It's huge!,115
5160,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.",115
5161,JERRY," Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! ",115
5162,GEORGE,  What?,115
5163,JERRY, I got the call...!,115
5164,GEORGE, Jean-Paul?,115
5165,JERRY,  Jean-Paul! ,115
5166,JERRY," Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul.",115
5167,JERRY, All right.  Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 6,115
5168,JERRY, How about adult contemporary?,115
5169,JERRY, All right...we're going with adult contempo...  now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... ,115
5170,JERRY," Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 6",115
5171,JERRY, That's room 419. 6,115
5172,JERRY," I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.",115
5173,JERRY," Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...",115
5174,JERRY," ...Yeah I am, but I just...",115
5175,JERRY, humm...,115
5176,JERRY, I think I offended the wake-up guy...! ,115
5177,JERRY,"  No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!",115
5178,JERRY, What if he doesn't call now out of spite?,115
5179,JERRY,  Not comfortable... ,115
5180,ELAINE, Jean-Paul?  Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul?  Jean-Paul?! Oh man...  Oh...machine.,115
5181,ELAINE," Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. ",115
5182,ELAINE," Judy, hi, listen...",115
5183,ELAINE, Oh I didn't tell anyone.,115
5184,ELAINE, ... Jerry! ,115
5185,JERRY," Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.",115
5186,JERRY," Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. ",115
5187,JERRY," That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. ",115
5188,JERRY,  Man that thing is noisy!,115
5189,KRAMER,"  Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!",115
5190,JERRY," Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 6",115
5191,KRAMER," Yeah, ok. Wait.  Done! ",115
5192,JERRY, He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.,115
5193,JERRY," Frankly, I'm a little concerned.",115
5194,ELAINE," Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet  ...my feet are resilient!  Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!!  Yes!",115
5195,JERRY, 4,115
5196,JERRY," Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!",115
5197,JERRY," Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!",115
5198,KRAMER," Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!",115
5199,JERRY, What happened to your mental alarm?!,115
5200,KRAMER, I guess I hit the snooze... ,115
5201,JERRY," Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! ",115
5202,JERRY," All right, go, it's a race! Come on!",115
5203,GEORGE," You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?",115
5204,GEORGE," Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...",115
5205,JERRY," I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!",115
5206,ELAINE," Then how did she find out, Jerry?!",115
5207,JERRY, Maybe you should check with the rabbi.,115
5208,KRAMER,  You want some hot tea?,115
5209,ELAINE," Oh no, thank you.",115
5210,KRAMER, Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!,115
5211,ELAINE, There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading!  Go Jean-Paul!,115

5218,JERRY, You're a shmoopy!,116
5219,JERRY, You're a shmoopy!,116
5220,GEORGE," All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.",116
5221,JERRY," Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?",116
5222,GEORGE, Hey.,116
5223,ELAINE, Hey.,116
5224,ELAINE, Hi Sheila.,116
5225,JERRY," All right, then. I'll see you later.",116
5226,JERRY, Bye shmoopy.,116
5227,ELAINE, Okay. We ready to go?,116
5228,GEORGE," Yes. Please. Please, let's go.",116
5229,ELAINE," Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.",116
5230,JERRY, No. We gotta go to the soup place.,116
5231,ELAINE, What soup place?,116
5232,GEORGE," Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.",116
5233,JERRY," He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.",116
5234,ELAINE, Stunned by soup?,116
5235,JERRY," You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.",116
5236,ELAINE, Huh. All right. Come on.,116
5237,JERRY," There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.",116
5238,ELAINE, Why? What happens if you don't order right?,116
5239,JERRY, He yells and you don't get your soup.,116
5240,ELAINE, What?,116
5241,JERRY, Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.,116
5242,GEORGE, All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.,116
5243,JERRY, All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.,116
5244,ELAINE, What?,116
5245,JERRY, The main thing is to keep the line moving.,116
5246,GEORGE," All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.",116
5247,JERRY, Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.,116
5248,ELAINE," Oh, boy, I'm really scared!",116
5249,JERRY, Elaine.,116
5250,ELAINE," All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.",116
5251,JERRY, Ar-moire.,116
5252,ELAINE, How much is this?,116
5253,ELAINE," Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.",116
5254,JERRY, He gave you the nice face discount.,116
5255,ELAINE, Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.,116
5256,JERRY, What about the soup?,116
5257,ELAINE," I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.",116
5258,JERRY, [in French accent] Pardon.,116
5259,GEORGE, This line is huge.,116
5260,JERRY, It's like this all the time.,116
5261,GEORGE, Isn't that that Bania guy?,116
5262,JERRY," Oh, no. It is. Just be still.",116
5263,GEORGE, Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.,116
5264,JERRY, Hard to believe.,116
5265,JERRY," Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.",116
5266,JERRY," Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.",116
5267,GEORGE, Medium turkey chili.,116
5268,JERRY, Medium crab bisque.,116
5269,GEORGE, I didn't get any bread.,116
5270,JERRY, Just forget it. Let it go.,116
5271,GEORGE," Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.",116
5272,GEORGE, $2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.,116
5273,GEORGE," Yes, please.",116
5274,GEORGE, What?,116
5275,ELAINE, What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.,116
5276,ELAINE," But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.",116
5277,ELAINE," Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.",116
5278,ELAINE," Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.",116
5279,JERRY," Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?",116
5280,GEORGE," You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?",116
5281,JERRY, I gave you a taste. What do you want?,116
5282,GEORGE, Why can't we share?,116
5283,JERRY," I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!",116
5284,GEORGE, Do you hear yourself?,116
5285,JERRY, I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.,116
5286,GEORGE," Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.",116
5287,JERRY, Hi shmoopy.,116
5288,JERRY, You're a shmoopy!,116
5289,GEORGE, I'm going.,116
5290,JERRY," Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?",116
5291,GEORGE," You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.",116
5292,JERRY, Why?,116
5293,GEORGE, I just don't feel like it anymore.,116
5294,JERRY, Just like that?,116
5295,GEORGE, Just like that.,116
5296,KRAMER, Hey.,116
5297,JERRY, Hey.,116
5298,KRAMER, [taking Jerry's couch cushion] Yeah.,116
5299,JERRY, Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?,116
5300,KRAMER," Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.",116
5301,JERRY," Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.",116
5302,KRAMER," Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!",116
5303,ELAINE," Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.",116
5304,KRAMER," Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.",116
5305,ELAINE, Do you need anything?,116
5306,KRAMER," Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.",116
5307,ELAINE, Mulligatawny?,116
5308,KRAMER, Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.,116
5309,ELAINE, Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?,116
5310,KRAMER, He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.,116
5311,ELAINE, All right. I'll be back.,116
5312,KRAMER, Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.,116
5313,ELAINE," Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.",116
5314,KRAMER," No. No, Elaine!",116
5315,ELAINE," Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?",116
5316,GEORGE, No. I didn't get it.,116
5317,ELAINE, Why? What happened?,116
5318,GEORGE, I made a mistake.,116
5319,ELAINE, [laughing],116
5320,GEORGE," All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.",116
5321,ELAINE," Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.",116
5322,GEORGE," Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?",116
5323,ELAINE," Oh, I know! It is awful!",116
5324,GEORGE, Why do they have to do that in front of people?,116
5325,ELAINE, I don't know.,116
5326,GEORGE, What is that with the shmoopy?,116
5327,ELAINE, Ohh!,116
5328,GEORGE," The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!",116
5329,ELAINE, Ohh! Stop it! I know.,116
5330,GEORGE, I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.,116
5331,ELAINE, Ugh!,116
5332,GEORGE, And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.,116
5333,ELAINE," You know, we should say something.",116
5334,GEORGE," You know, we absolutely should.",116
5335,ELAINE," I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?",116
5336,GEORGE, I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.,116
5337,ELAINE, Yeah.,116
5338,GEORGE, I still haven't figured him out.,116
5339,ELAINE, No. Me neither.,116
5340,GEORGE, All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.,116
5341,ELAINE," Oh, God!",116
5342,GEORGE, Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.,116
5343,GEORGE, Sorry. Thank you.,116
5344,ELAINE," Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?",116
5345,ELAINE," Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, "" Scent Of A Woman."" Who-ah! Who-ah!",116
5346,ELAINE," Well, I --",116
5347,ELAINE, Hmmm?,116
5348,ELAINE, What?,116
5349,KRAMER, Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?,116
5350,KRAMER, You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.,116
5351,KRAMER, Huh?,116
5352,KRAMER," What is this, huh?",116
5353,ELAINE," I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.",116
5354,GEORGE," Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.",116
5355,ELAINE," All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?",116
5356,KRAMER," Well, b -- it was stolen.",116
5357,ELAINE, Wha--?,116
5358,KRAMER," These street toughs, they robbed me.",116
5359,ELAINE, Street toughs took my armoire?,116
5360,KRAMER, Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.,116
5361,ELAINE, I can't believe this!,116
5362,KRAMER," Well, where's the soup?",116
5363,ELAINE, Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.,116
5364,KRAMER, Oh...yeah!,116
5365,JERRY, What are you gonna get?,116
5366,JERRY," You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!",116
5367,JERRY, Uh-oh.,116
5368,JERRY, Do I know you?,116
5369,ELAINE," So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?",116
5370,JERRY, It was a bisque.,116
5371,ELAINE," Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.",116
5372,JERRY, Really?,116
5373,ELAINE," Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.",116
5374,JERRY, Have you tastes the soup?,116
5375,ELAINE, Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.,116
5376,JERRY," See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.",116
5377,JERRY, Hey.,116
5378,KRAMER, Yeah.,116
5379,ELAINE, Hey.,116
5380,KRAMER, Yeah.,116
5381,JERRY," Oh, thanks.",116
5382,ELAINE, There he is.,116
5383,KRAMER," Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.",116
5384,ELAINE," Yeah. I know. Me, too.",116
5385,JERRY," So, did these thieves want any money?",116
5386,KRAMER, No.,116
5387,JERRY, They just wanted the armoire?,116
5388,KRAMER, Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.,116
5389,JERRY, Yeah?,116
5390,GEORGE, Hup! Hup!,116
5391,JERRY," Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?",116
5392,ELAINE, No. In what way?,116
5393,JERRY," I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.",116
5394,ELAINE, I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.,116
5395,GEORGE, Hello.,116
5396,JERRY, Hello.,116
5397,KRAMER, Hey.,116
5398,GEORGE, Hello.,116
5399,ELAINE, Hello.,116
5400,GEORGE, Were you just talking about me? What's going on?,116
5401,JERRY, Absolutely not.,116
5402,GEORGE, Something's going on here.,116
5403,KRAMER," All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.",116
5404,ELAINE, One of these days that guy is gonna get his.,116
5405,GEORGE," So, how was the movie?",116
5406,JERRY," Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.",116
5407,GEORGE," Oh, yeah?",116
5408,JERRY," Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?",116
5409,GEORGE, Happy? Why should I be happy?,116
5410,JERRY," I don't know, but you look like you're happy.",116
5411,GEORGE, Why should I care?,116
5412,JERRY," You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.",116
5413,GEORGE," All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?",116
5414,JERRY, Is that so?,116
5415,GEORGE," Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!",116
5416,JERRY, Disgusting?,116
5417,GEORGE, People who do that should be arrested.,116
5418,JERRY," Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.",116
5419,GEORGE," Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.",116
5420,JERRY, What?,116
5421,GEORGE, You shook my hand in that coffee shop.,116
5422,JERRY, You're still with the pact?,116
5423,GEORGE, Mmm-hmm. You reneged.,116
5424,JERRY, All I did was shake your hand.,116
5425,GEORGE, Ah-ha!,116
5426,KRAMER," And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.",116
5427,KRAMER," Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.",116
5428,KRAMER, How can I possibly thank you?,116
5429,KRAMER, You suffer for your soup.,116
5430,KRAMER," You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.",116
5431,KRAMER, Git.,116
5432,JERRY, It was stupid of me.,116
5433,JERRY, No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.,116
5434,JERRY," What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says "" Aw, I'll just have some coffee."" There's no truth to that.",116
5435,JERRY," So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?",116
5436,JERRY, Aw!,116
5437,JERRY," Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.",116
5438,GEORGE," Oh, yes. Hello.",116
5439,GEORGE," No, thanks.",116
5440,GEORGE," Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?",116
5441,JERRY, Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?,116
5442,GEORGE," I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.",116
5443,JERRY," Well, we're changing the rules.",116
5444,GEORGE, Ahh. Good for you.,116
5445,GEORGE," I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?",116
5446,GEORGE," Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.",116
5447,JERRY," What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?",116
5448,JERRY, Yum yum little tuna fishy?,116
5449,GEORGE, Come here.,116
5450,KRAMER, And..voila!,116
5451,ELAINE, [gasps],116
5452,KRAMER, Yeah.,116
5453,ELAINE," Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!",116
5454,KRAMER, Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?,116
5455,ELAINE, The K Man did it!,116
5456,KRAMER, Yeah!,116
5457,ELAINE, [laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?,116
5458,KRAMER, How 'bout zero?,116
5459,ELAINE, What?,116
5460,KRAMER, Yeah.,116
5461,ELAINE, What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?,116
5462,KRAMER, I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.,116
5463,ELAINE, Get out!,116
5464,ELAINE, The Soup Nazi gave it to you?,116
5465,KRAMER, Yeah.,116
5466,ELAINE, Why?,116
5467,KRAMER," Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.",116
5468,ELAINE, [gasps],116
5469,KRAMER," Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....",116
5470,ELAINE," Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!",116
5471,KRAMER," Yeah. Well, he's a dear.",116
5472,GEORGE, How much tip do you leave on $8.15?,116
5473,GEORGE, Huh?,116
5474,ELAINE," Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.",116
5475,JERRY, I'm heading over to Elaine's.,116
5476,KRAMER," Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.",116
5477,JERRY, Those two?,116
5478,KRAMER, Yeah.,116
5479,JERRY, Are you sure?,116
5480,KRAMER, Yeah. That's them.,116
5481,JERRY," Well, let's confront 'em.",116
5482,KRAMER, No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.,116
5483,JERRY, There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.,116
5484,KRAMER, No!,116
5485,JERRY, Let's go.,116
5486,KRAMER, Excuse me.,116
5487,KRAMER," Uh, well, uh, we --",116
5488,KRAMER," Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?",116
5489,ELAINE," I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?",116
5490,JERRY," I don't know. "" 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley...""",116
5491,ELAINE," Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!",116
5492,JERRY, So?,116
5493,ELAINE," So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.",116
5494,JERRY," Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?",116
5495,ELAINE, What do you care?,116
5496,JERRY," Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.",116
5497,ELAINE," Get out of my way, Jerry.",116
5498,JERRY," Elaine, let the man make his soup!",116
5499,ELAINE," Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.",116
5500,GEORGE," Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.",116
5501,JERRY, Well. Well.,116
5502,JERRY," Hey, Susan, George.",116
5503,JERRY," Oh, really?",116
5504,JERRY, Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.,116
5505,JERRY," Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.",116
5506,GEORGE, Really?,116
5507,JERRY," Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.",116
5508,GEORGE, You did?,116
5509,JERRY," Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.",116
5510,GEORGE, Yeah. See ya.,116
5511,ELAINE, Hello.,116
5512,ELAINE," I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. "" 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery.""",116
5513,ELAINE," Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.",116
5514,ELAINE, You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!,116
5515,JERRY, What is it?,116
5516,JERRY, Wha - wha - what's the matter?,116
5517,JERRY," Well, where are you going?",116
5518,GEORGE," Yeah, I better grab some too.",117
5519,GEORGE, You sure?,117
5520,GEORGE, My code?,117
5521,JERRY, So why didn't you tell her the code?,117
5522,GEORGE, No. No way.,117
5523,JERRY," George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.",117
5524,GEORGE," It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'",117
5525,JERRY, So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?,117
5526,GEORGE, Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?,117
5527,JERRY," Actually, that's the definition of selfish.",117
5528,GEORGE, Have you ever given your code to anyone?,117
5529,JERRY, No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.',117
5530,GEORGE, Superman's father on Krypton.,117
5531,JERRY," Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.",117
5532,GEORGE, No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.,117
5533,JERRY, What if my life depended on it?,117
5534,GEORGE," If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.",117
5535,GEORGE, What's the matter with your leg?,117
5536,JERRY, My foot fell asleep.,117
5537,GEORGE, How'd your foot fall asleep?,117
5538,JERRY," I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.",117
5539,JERRY, Hey Fred.,117
5540,GEORGE, Hey Fred.,117
5541,JERRY, My foot fell asleep.,117
5542,JERRY," Fred, do you know Elaine?",117
5543,GEORGE," Alright, bye.",117
5544,JERRY, Seeya.,117
5545,ELAINE," Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'",117
5546,JERRY, So?,117
5547,ELAINE," So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.",117
5548,JERRY, And he didn't remember you?,117
5549,JERRY," Where are you going, you just got here?",117
5550,ELAINE, I gotta go talk to him.,117
5551,ELAINE," Excuse me, excuse me, Fred?",117
5552,ELAINE," You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.",117
5553,ELAINE," Yeah, at Katie Ash's party?",117
5554,ELAINE, Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?,117
5555,ELAINE," When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?",117
5556,ELAINE, That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.,117

5563,KRAMER," When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.",117
5564,JERRY, You're lucky they let you drive a car.,117
5565,KRAMER," No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.",117
5566,ELAINE, What was that?,117

5593,JERRY," I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.",117
5594,KRAMER," Oh, oh your foot fell asleep.",117
5595,JERRY," Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.",117
5596,KRAMER," Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?",117
5597,JERRY, Yup.,117

5599,JERRY," Wow, the whole building burned down.",117

5601,JERRY, Of course.,117
5602,KRAMER," It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.",117
5603,JERRY, The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.,117

5608,GEORGE, No way.,117
5609,JERRY, There you go.,117

5619,ELAINE," No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.",117
5620,JERRY," ...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.",117
5621,GEORGE, Call the Embassy.,117
5622,JERRY, They're closed.,117
5623,GEORGE, Why?,117

5634,JERRY," We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.",117
5635,GEORGE," I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank.",117
5636,JERRY," George, what's the matter with you?",117
5637,GEORGE, I'm choking!,117
5638,JERRY," Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.",117
5639,ELAINE,"  I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?",117

5641,GEORGE," You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.",117

5643,ELAINE," Well, Fred asked me out.",117
5644,JERRY, Fred?,117
5645,ELAINE," Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.",117
5646,JERRY, You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.,117
5647,ELAINE, I am? But that's so sick.,117
5648,JERRY, That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.,117
5649,ELAINE," Anyway, so how was the dinner?",117
5650,JERRY," Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.",117

5656,GEORGE," Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fiancé, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!",117
5657,GEORGE," Oh, shhh.",117
5658,GEORGE, Shut up! Shut up!,117
5659,GEORGE, You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.,117
5660,JERRY, I did not bail out on you.,117
5661,GEORGE, Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?,117
5662,JERRY, Why didn't you come up with your own?,117
5663,GEORGE, I froze. I think I'm losing it.,117
5664,JERRY," Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?",117
5665,GEORGE," No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.",117
5666,GEORGE, Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.,117
5667,JERRY," Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?",117
5668,GEORGE, I am not giving you my code.,117

5670,GEORGE, Pssh. Yeah. Right.,117
5671,KRAMER," Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?",117
5672,GEORGE, Huh?,117
5673,KRAMER," You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.",117
5674,GEORGE, Get out of here.,117
5675,KRAMER," Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.",117

5677,KRAMER,"  No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!",117

5686,ELAINE, I got a date.,117
5687,ELAINE," Oh, Mr. Peterman.",117
5688,GEORGE, Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.,117

5703,JERRY, No I didn't.,117
5704,KRAMER," Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.",117

5710,KRAMER," Well, you'd better take it easy.",117
5711,ELAINE, Huh.,117

5727,JERRY,"I’d like to know when Tic-Tac-Toe became the Pound sign, that's what I’d like to know. Why don't they call it what it really is -- “Leave your numeric message now and then press Archie’s head.” And what is that redial button? Let's face it -- you're either going to get the person, the machine or they have call waiting. Who is redialing and redialing? This is like the harassment key for people in a fight, you know.																										“Hey I’m not through --” CLICK. Blulululululu.													“You can't do that to me --” CLICK. Blulululululu.													“And another thing --” CLICK. Blulululululu.",118
5728,GEORGE, Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?,118

5733,JERRY, Hey Elaine.,118
5734,ELAINE, Hey.,118
5735,JERRY," Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. ",118

5767,KRAMER, Ka shha shha shha Pkooo ,118

6126,JERRY, You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?,119
6127,KRAMER," Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!",119
6128,JERRY, You went all night?,119
6129,JERRY," Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!",119
6130,KRAMER, AIDS walk! That's a cake walk.  Hey!,119
6131,JERRY," So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.",119
6132,GEORGE, Really? How'd she do that?,119
6133,JERRY, A friend of a friend of Susan's.,119
6134,GEORGE, My Susan?,119
6135,JERRY, Why'd you tell her?!,119
6136,GEORGE," Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!",119
6137,JERRY," Well you know what this means, don't you?",119
6138,GEORGE, What?													(IMG SRC,119
6139,JERRY,"JERRY: Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go ""isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude."" ",12
6140,GEORGE," That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you.  You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing!  I quit! ",12
6141,KRAMER, Hey. ,12
6142,JERRY, Hey. ,12
6143,KRAMER," Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself. ",12
6144,JERRY," Well, what'd you say? ",12
6145,KRAMER," I said "" Jump."" Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said "" Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me."" At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something. ",12
6146,JERRY, What's his problem? ,12
6147,KRAMER, No job. No women. ,12
6148,JERRY, He called the right guy. ,12
6149,KRAMER," Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him? ",12
6150,JERRY," All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry. ",12
6151,KRAMER, Why don't you use the machines down in the basement? ,12
6152,JERRY, Fluff and Fold. The only way to live.  I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight. ,12
6153,KRAMER, How 'bout if I put a few things -- ,12
6154,JERRY, Wait a sec. I don't wanna do -- ,12
6155,KRAMER," Well, you're going over there. ",12
6156,JERRY, I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot. ,12
6157,KRAMER, Have you ever met my guys? ,12
6158,JERRY, No. I can't say as I have. ,12
6159,KRAMER, Well! ,12
6160,JERRY, All right. Put 'em on top. ,12
6161,KRAMER, Ah! ,12
6162,JERRY," Oh, beautiful. ",12
6163,JERRY, This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine? ,12
6164,JERRY," Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across. ",12
6165,GEORGE, Guess what. ,12
6166,JERRY, How did you know I was here? ,12
6167,GEORGE, Kramer. Guess what. ,12
6168,JERRY, I don't know. ,12
6169,GEORGE, I quit my job. ,12
6170,JERRY, Get outta here. ,12
6171,GEORGE, I couldn't take it anymore. ,12
6172,JERRY, What happened? Levitan? ,12
6173,GEORGE," I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well,  I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting! ",12
6174,JERRY, You and your toilets. ,12
6175,GEORGE, I snapped! It was the last straw.  ,12
6176,JERRY," So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate? ",12
6177,GEORGE, Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible. ,12
6178,JERRY, So what are you gonna do? ,12
6179,GEORGE, I like sports. I could do something in sports. ,12
6180,JERRY, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity? ,12
6181,GEORGE," You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something. ",12
6182,JERRY," Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get. ",12
6183,GEORGE," Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game. ",12
6184,JERRY, Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments. ,12
6185,GEORGE, What about that? ,12
6186,JERRY," Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting. ",12
6187,GEORGE," Well, that's really not fair. ",12
6188,JERRY," I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like? ",12
6189,GEORGE, Movies. I like to watch movies. ,12
6190,JERRY, Yeah. Yeah. ,12
6191,GEORGE, Do they pay people to watch movies? ,12
6192,JERRY, Projectionists. ,12
6193,GEORGE, That's true. ,12
6194,JERRY, But you gotta know how to work the projector. ,12
6195,GEORGE, Right. ,12
6196,JERRY, And it's probably a union thing. ,12
6197,GEORGE,"  Those unions.  Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host? ",12
6198,JERRY, Talk show host. That's good. ,12
6199,GEORGE, I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host. ,12
6200,JERRY, Really? ,12
6201,GEORGE," Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start? ",12
6202,JERRY," Well, that's where it gets tricky. ",12
6203,GEORGE," You can't just walk into a building and say "" I wanna be a talk show host."" ",12
6204,JERRY, I wouldn't think so. ,12
6205,GEORGE, It's all politics. ,12
6206,JERRY," All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else? ",12
6207,GEORGE, This could have been a huge mistake. ,12
6208,JERRY," Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through. ",12
6209,GEORGE,  Guess not. What should I do? ,12
6210,JERRY, Maybe you can just go back. ,12
6211,GEORGE, Go back? ,12
6212,JERRY, Yeah. Pretend like it never happened. ,12
6213,GEORGE, You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened? ,12
6214,JERRY, Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously. ,12
6215,GEORGE, Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened. ,12
6216,JERRY, Never happened. ,12
6217,GEORGE, I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what? ,12
6218,JERRY, So what? You're entitled. ,12
6219,GEORGE, I'm emotional. ,12
6220,JERRY, That's right. You're emotional. ,12
6221,GEORGE, Never happened. ,12
6222,JERRY, Never happened. ,12
6223,JERRY," To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in ""morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine"" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, ""How ya doin'?"" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow ""Hey"" You start coming up with nicknames for them. ""Jimbo.""",12
6224,GEORGE, How ya doin'? ,12
6225,GEORGE, What? I work here. ,12
6226,GEORGE, What quit?  Who quit? ,12
6227,GEORGE, Yeah. Good weekend. ,12
6228,GEORGE," Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor. ",12
6229,GEORGE, What? ,12
6230,GEORGE, When? ,12
6231,GEORGE," Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously? ",12
6232,GEORGE, Come on. Will you stop it. ,12
6233,GEORGE, Teasing. ,12
6234,GEORGE," I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh,  you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?",12
6235,GEORGE," "" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser."" This is what he said to me. ",12
6236,JERRY," Well, so that's that. ",12
6237,GEORGE, No. That's not that. ,12
6238,JERRY, That's not that? ,12
6239,GEORGE, No. ,12
6240,JERRY," Well, if that's not that, what is that? ",12
6241,GEORGE, I've got some plans. I got plans. ,12
6242,JERRY, What kind of plans? ,12
6243,GEORGE, What's the difference? ,12
6244,JERRY, You don't wanna tell me? ,12
6245,GEORGE, I'm gonna slip him a mickey. ,12
6246,JERRY, What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre? ,12
6247,GEORGE, You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing. ,12
6248,JERRY, What if you destroy him? ,12
6249,GEORGE, No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over. ,12
6250,JERRY," Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal. ",12
6251,GEORGE, This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey! ,12
6252,JERRY, You've really gone mental. ,12
6253,GEORGE, Nah. ,12
6254,JERRY," Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying ""mickey""! ",12
6255,GEORGE, I got a source. ,12
6256,JERRY, You got a mickey source? ,12
6257,GEORGE, And Elaine is gonna keep him busy. ,12
6258,JERRY, Elaine? How did you rope her into this? ,12
6259,GEORGE, I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife. ,12
6260,JERRY, She knew that. ,12
6261,GEORGE, But she didn't know he doesn't recycle. ,12
6262,JERRY, What is the point of all this? ,12
6263,GEORGE, Revenge. ,12
6264,JERRY," Oh, the best revenge is living well. ",12
6265,GEORGE, There's no chance of that. ,12
6266,JERRY, Did you get your laundry? ,12
6267,KRAMER, Yeah. ,12
6268,JERRY, What's with you? ,12
6269,KRAMER, He jumped. ,12
6270,JERRY, What? ,12
6271,KRAMER, Yeah. Newman jumped. ,12
6272,JERRY, Did he call you last night? ,12
6273,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. ",12
6274,JERRY, What did you say? ,12
6275,KRAMER," I said "" Wave to me when you pass my window."" ",12
6276,JERRY, Whew. Did he wave? ,12
6277,KRAMER," No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me. ",12
6278,JERRY,"  Oh, my god! ",12
6279,KRAMER, What's the matter? ,12
6280,JERRY,"  Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go. ",12
6281,KRAMER, Where? Where? ,12
6282,JERRY, To the Laundromat. ,12
6283,KRAMER, Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing? ,12
6284,JERRY," Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society. ",12
6285,JERRY," So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry? ",12
6286,JERRY, Come on. Let's go. ,12
6287,KRAMER, No. You can't let him get away with this. ,12
6288,ELAINE, Which one is he? ,12
6289,GEORGE, That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish. ,12
6290,ELAINE," Oh, yeah. I see him. ",12
6291,GEORGE," Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this. ",12
6292,ELAINE, Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison? ,12
6293,GEORGE, This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done. ,12
6294,ELAINE, Yeah. It is kind of cool. ,12
6295,GEORGE, First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone. ,12
6296,ELAINE, I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies. ,12
6297,GEORGE, That's exactly what I told Jerry! ,12
6298,ELAINE, Really? ,12
6299,GEORGE," Yes!  God, I've never felt so alive! ",12
6300,JERRY, Maybe we should call this off. ,12
6301,KRAMER, Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine. ,12
6302,JERRY, And what's gonna happen? ,12
6303,KRAMER," Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block! ",12
6304,JERRY, If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor. ,12
6305,KRAMER, You keep him busy. ,12
6306,KRAMER, Whoa! ,12
6307,GEORGE, You go over there - ,12
6308,ELAINE, Yeah. ,12
6309,GEORGE," You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink. ",12
6310,ELAINE, Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth? ,12
6311,ELAINE, Oops!  'Scuse me. ,12
6312,ELAINE, Hi. ,12
6313,ELAINE,  ,12
6314,ELAINE," Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much.  Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou! ",12
6315,ELAINE," People don't say "" God bless you "" as much as they used to. Have you noticed that? ",12
6316,ELAINE,"  So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week. ",12
6317,ELAINE," Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah! ",12
6318,ELAINE," Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked. ",12
6319,ELAINE," Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day. ",12
6320,GEORGE,"  Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat? ",12
6321,GEORGE,  I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here. ,12
6322,GEORGE,  Okay. Okay. Fine. ,12
6323,ELAINE," I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked. ",12
6324,ELAINE," Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble. ",12
6325,JERRY,  What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that? ,12
6326,JERRY, Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle? ,12
6327,JERRY, What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament? ,12
6328,JERRY, What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks? ,12
6329,KRAMER, I didn't realize it was a full box. ,12
6330,GEORGE,"  I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off. ",12
6331,GEORGE, One... ,12
6332,ELAINE," No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around. ",12
6333,ELAINE, I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra. ,12
6334,GEORGE," Hello, Rick. ",12
6335,GEORGE," That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me! ",12
6336,GEORGE, Oh! ,12
6337,GEORGE, Boom! ,12
6338,GEORGE, Oh. ,12
6339,GEORGE, You want me to come back? Uh... ,12
6340,GEORGE, Rick. ,12
6341,GEORGE," Uh, Rick.. ",12
6342,GEORGE, Rick. ,12
6343,GEORGE, Drink up. ,12
6344,GEORGE," I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something. ",12
6345,ELAINE," Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree. ",12
6346,JERRY, Yeah. That's true. ,12
6347,KRAMER,  Oh.,12
6348,JERRY," What?  My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it? ",12
6349,KRAMER, It was in my laundry. ,12
6350,JERRY, In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be? ,12
6351,KRAMER, It was about 1200 bucks. ,12
6352,KRAMER, Oh! That's Newman. ,12
6353,KRAMER,"  Well, what are you waiting for? ",12
6354,JERRY," Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money.. ",12
6355,GEORGE,  I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy. ,12
6356,KRAMER, You wanna shoot some pool tonight? ,12
6357,GEORGE,  Nah. It's probably a union thing. ,12
6358,JERRY," People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'",12
6359,JERRY," I think gum is, is one of the weirdest human inventions.  It's not a liquid, 's not a solid, 's not a food. What is it? It isn't really anything, you know. I mean, it's like a stationary bike for your jaw. Like, remember when you were in school, and teachers would get all riled up if they caught you with gum? And when you were a kid, you'd think 'What is the big deal?' But, as an adult, I can understand it, because when you're chewing gum, you don't look like you're too thrilled with anything anyone has to say.  'Oh, World War Two. That was an important historical event? Yeah, I'm sure.' 'They landed a man on the moon, nineteen sixty-nine? Yeah, right. Yeah, I buy that, teach.'",120
6360,GEORGE, You think she's happy?,120
6361,JERRY, Who?,120
6362,GEORGE,  The cashier.,120
6363,JERRY, Ruthie Cohen?,120
6364,GEORGE,  You know her name?,120
6365,JERRY, Sure.,120
6366,GEORGE, I don't think I've ever spoken to her.,120
6367,JERRY, Maybe that's why she's happy.,120
6368,KRAMER,"  Good morning, gentlemen.",120
6369,JERRY, What is this?,120
6370,KRAMER,"  Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.",120
6371,JERRY, That stinky old movie-house?,120
6372,KRAMER,"  Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.",120
6373,GEORGE,  With Spartacus?,120
6374,KRAMER,"  Well, it's a rare archival print.  Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.",120
6375,JERRY, Geoffrey who?,120
6376,KRAMER," Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.",120
6377,GEORGE, Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?,120
6378,KRAMER," Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill?  Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.",120
6379,GEORGE, Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?,120
6380,KRAMER," Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.",120
6381,JERRY, I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.,120
6382,KRAMER," Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.",120
6383,GEORGE, Really?,120
6384,KRAMER," Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.",120
6385,JERRY," Oh, then I'm not worried.",120
6386,KRAMER," But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.",120
6387,GEORGE,"  Breakdown, huh?",120
6388,KRAMER," Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. ",120
6389,KRAMER,  Sit down. ,120
6390,JERRY, Lloyd.,120
6391,GEORGE," Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?",120
6392,KRAMER," Yeah well, he's doing fine, George.",120
6393,JERRY,  That's an interesting package.,120
6394,KRAMER," Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. ",120
6395,GEORGE, I don't chew gum.,120
6396,JERRY,"  Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?",120
6397,JERRY," Nah, don't bother.",120
6398,JERRY, I don't want it.,120
6399,KRAMER," Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.",120
6400,JERRY, Alright.,120
6401,KRAMER," Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm.",120
6402,GEORGE, You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.,120
6403,ELAINE, Hey.,120
6404,GEORGE, Hey.,120
6405,JERRY, I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. ,120
6406,ELAINE, What kind is that?,120
6407,JERRY," It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.",120
6408,ELAINE, Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?,120
6409,GEORGE,"  After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.",120
6410,ELAINE," You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?",120
6411,JERRY," You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.",120
6412,ELAINE," Yeah? Well, I got news for you.",120
6413,GEORGE," The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'",120
6414,JERRY, And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.,120
6415,GEORGE," Right, gotta get going.",120
6416,JERRY, Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?,120
6417,GEORGE," Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.",120
6418,JERRY, I thought your parents were outta town?,120
6419,GEORGE, Why d'you think I'm going now?,120
6420,GEORGE," Hey, Mr Lazzari.",120
6421,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.",120
6422,GEORGE," Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.",120
6423,GEORGE, Something like that.,120
6424,GEORGE," Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.",120
6425,GEORGE," Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug.  Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.",120
6426,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?",120
6427,KRAMER," The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.",120
6428,ELAINE," Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?",120
6429,KRAMER," Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.",120
6430,JERRY," Oh, can Lloyd really do that?",120
6431,KRAMER," Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry.  And you should say hello to him, Elaine.",120
6432,ELAINE,  What? Lloyd is here?,120
6433,ELAINE," What? No, no, I'd rather...",120
6434,ELAINE,"  Lloyd, yes. Hello.",120
6435,ELAINE,"  Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm,  because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards.",120
6436,KRAMER,"  You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all.  Not crazy.",120
6437,JERRY, We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?,120
6438,ELAINE," I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.",120
6439,JERRY," Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.",120
6440,GEORGE, I know. Completely bonkers!,120
6441,GEORGE, Pop? What happened to Pop?,120
6442,GEORGE,"  He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?",120
6443,GEORGE,"  Uhm, I, I gotta go.",120
6444,GEORGE," I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.",120
6445,GEORGE, Pop! POP!!,120
6446,KRAMER, Yeah.,120
6447,JERRY, I don't know what I was thinking.,120
6448,JERRY,  Errh.,120
6449,KRAMER,"  Ah, he loved it.",120
6450,ELAINE," Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.",120
6451,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired.",120
6452,ELAINE, Oh. Oh God.,120
6453,ELAINE," Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.",120
6454,ELAINE," Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?",120
6455,KRAMER," Yeah, put these glasses on.",120
6456,JERRY,"  Well, what's this for?",120
6457,KRAMER," Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.",120
6458,JERRY, So what?,120
6459,KRAMER," Well, he thinks you wear those.",120
6460,KRAMER, They're from the lost and found at the Alex.,120
6461,JERRY," Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.",120
6462,KRAMER," Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.",120
6463,GEORGE," 'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill,  but you only gave me change for a ten.",120
6464,GEORGE," Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well,  that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?",120
6465,GEORGE," Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.",120
6466,GEORGE, I don't.,120
6467,GEORGE, I know I gave it to you.,120
6468,GEORGE,  Fine. Fine.  Excuse me.  Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!,120
6469,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry, look who's here.",120
6470,JERRY," Ah, Lloyd.",120
6471,JERRY,"  Oh, the gum.",120
6472,KRAMER," Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?",120
6473,JERRY,"  Uh, alright. ",120
6474,KRAMER," Oh, boy.",120
6475,KRAMER," Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.",120
6476,JERRY," Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.",120
6477,JERRY, 's not necessary.,120
6478,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.",120
6479,JERRY," I know that, Kramer.",120
6480,KRAMER," No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?",120
6481,JERRY," Yes I do, Kramer.",120
6482,KRAMER, Yeah?,120
6483,KRAMER," Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?",120
6484,JERRY, I didn't see anything.,120
6485,KRAMER," Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.",120
6486,GEORGE," Well, you know.  It's understandable.",120
6487,GEORGE, Warning signs?,120
6488,GEORGE,"  What?  Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem.  Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.",120
6489,GEORGE, All my friends do that.,120
6490,GEORGE, You see that woman on the horse? ,120
6491,GEORGE," She stole twenty dollars from me.  Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!",120
6492,GEORGE,"  Hey! Hey, you!  Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!",120
6493,JERRY, So you say she was on a horse?,120
6494,GEORGE," I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.",120
6495,JERRY," Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.",120
6496,ELAINE, Hey.,120
6497,JERRY," Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.",120
6498,ELAINE,  What?,120
6499,JERRY," I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.",120
6500,ELAINE,"  Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.",120
6501,JERRY, Maybe it's in the lost and found.,120
6502,ELAINE," Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.",120
6503,JERRY," You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.",120
6504,KRAMER," Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.",120
6505,KRAMER," Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?",120
6506,KRAMER, Brown?,120
6507,KRAMER," Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.",120
6508,GEORGE,  Alright. Alright.,120
6509,GEORGE,"  Hang on, it's warming up!",120
6510,GEORGE,  Oh you mother...,120
6511,GEORGE, Hey! What is your problem?,120
6512,GEORGE," Oh, hello, it's you!  Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars.  Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?",120
6513,GEORGE, Aah! Fire!,120
6514,GEORGE,  Fire!!,120
6515,GEORGE, Your hose! Where's your hose?!,120
6516,KRAMER," Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?",120
6517,GEORGE, The Jon Voight car is no more.,120
6518,KRAMER," Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.",120
6519,GEORGE, No kidding?,120
6520,KRAMER, No kidding.,120
6521,GEORGE," Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.",120
6522,KRAMER," Yeah, merry Christmas.",120
6523,GEORGE,  Whatever.,120
6524,JERRY," Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?",120
6525,KRAMER," What, he's not here yet?",120
6526,JERRY," Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!",120
6527,KRAMER," Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses.",120
6528,JERRY, Why?,120
6529,KRAMER, They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.,120
6530,KRAMER,"  Here, try this pair.",120
6531,JERRY," Aw, these are really strong glasses.",120
6532,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah.",120
6533,KRAMER,"  Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.",120
6534,KRAMER," Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.",120
6535,JERRY, Absolutely. Let's just stick around.,120
6536,KRAMER," Uh, yeah.",120
6537,KRAMER, Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?,120
6538,KRAMER," No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.",120
6539,KRAMER," No, no, no, no. I'll show you.  One hotdog please.",120
6540,KRAMER," Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?",120
6541,KRAMER," Yeah, here we go, yeah.  Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. ",120
6542,KRAMER," Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy.  I gotta get, some air.",120
6543,ELAINE," Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?",120
6544,ELAINE," Well, uhm... I...",120
6545,ELAINE, Uh... I...,120
6546,ELAINE," No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!",120
6547,ELAINE, Hey. Hey everybody.,120
6548,JERRY, Lloyd?,120
6549,JERRY, Lloyd?,120
6550,ELAINE,  What is Lloyd's problem?,120
6551,KRAMER," Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.",120
6552,ELAINE," Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose.",120
6553,KRAMER," Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.",120
6554,GEORGE, You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.,120
6555,GEORGE," No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.",120
6556,GEORGE, You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.,120
6557,GEORGE," No, she wasn't on the horse.",120
6558,GEORGE, That's right.,120
6559,GEORGE,  And him!,120
6560,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...",120
6561,GEORGE," I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.",120
6562,GEORGE, Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this.  Jerry.,120
6563,GEORGE, Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!,120
6564,GEORGE," Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're...",120
6565,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.",120
6566,GEORGE, I know. Don't you see.  He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!,120
6567,JERRY, Alright.,120
6568,JERRY,  Here.,120
6569,GEORGE," Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.",120
6570,GEORGE," Believe me, I am not crazy.",120
6571,JERRY,  Got all this?,120
6572,JERRY,  I gave you a hundred dollars?!,120
6573,JERRY, It's a lotta gum!,120
6574,KRAMER, Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses.,120
6575,KRAMER," Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W.",120
6576,KRAMER, Is that from Henry the Eighth?,120
6577,KRAMER," Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?",120
6578,KRAMER,  You don't say.,120
6579,KRAMER," You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.",120
6580,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.",120
6581,KRAMER," Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.",120
6582,GEORGE,"  Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.",120
6583,GEORGE,"  Can I get a pack of gum, please?",120
6584,GEORGE," What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that?  I guess I owe that cashier an apology.",120
6585,GEORGE," No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.",120
6586,GEORGE, Th... this isn't mine.,120
6587,GEORGE, I got it from the Institute. The Institute.,120
6588,GEORGE,  Dee... Deena!,120
6589,KRAMER," Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.",120
6590,KRAMER," Oh, he ran away.",120
6591,KRAMER, I need to talk to you.,120
6592,ELAINE," You know, that button looks very familiar.",120
6593,ELAINE," I, I think that's my button.  You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?",120
6594,ELAINE, Shall I undo it?,120
6595,ELAINE," Oh, thank you.",120
6596,ELAINE," Oh.  Tickle, tickle.",120
6597,KRAMER," Oh, tell me about it.",120
6598,ELAINE,"  I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.",121
6599,ELAINE," Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.",121
6600,JERRY, Maybe he'll write a song about you.,121
6601,ELAINE, Yeah. Right.  Like that really matters.,121
6602,JERRY, So I take it he's spongeworthy?,121
6603,ELAINE," Oh, yeah.",121
6604,JERRY," Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.",121
6605,ELAINE," Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.",121
6606,JERRY," Oh, no?",121
6607,ELAINE," Yeah. In fact, he....",121
6608,JERRY, Come on. Come on.,121
6609,ELAINE, I don't wanna!,121
6610,JERRY," Elaine, you're among friends.",121
6611,ELAINE,"  Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.",121
6612,JERRY, Oh.,121
6613,ELAINE, Yeah. It's surprising.,121
6614,JERRY," Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?",121
6615,ELAINE," No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.",121
6616,JERRY, Sure. Why not? You're there.,121
6617,ELAINE, Exactly.,121
6618,JERRY," But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.",121
6619,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.",121
6620,JERRY, What stuff?,121
6621,KRAMER," I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.",121
6622,JERRY," All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.",121
6623,KRAMER, Course I will. These are staples.,121
6624,JERRY, A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?,121
6625,KRAMER," Lindsay olives, Jerry.",121
6626,JERRY, A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?,121
6627,KRAMER, $17.50. You can't beat that.,121
6628,JERRY, Look...look at this can of tuna!,121
6629,KRAMER," Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.",121
6630,JERRY, This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.,121
6631,KRAMER," Hey, Clyde!",121
6632,KRAMER," Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here.",121
6633,JERRY, Hi.,121
6634,KRAMER," You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.",121
6635,JERRY, John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.,121
6636,JERRY," Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.",121
6637,KRAMER," Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.",121
6638,GEORGE," Yeah. Yeah, one second.",121
6639,GEORGE, All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.,121
6640,GEORGE," My in-laws. Oh, my....",121
6641,GEORGE, I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.,121
6642,GEORGE, This is gonna be fun.,121
6643,JERRY," Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.",121
6644,ELAINE, So what did he have to say?,121
6645,JERRY, Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.,121
6646,ELAINE, Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?,121
6647,JERRY, Yeah.,121
6648,ELAINE, What did you do that for?,121
6649,JERRY, What?,121
6650,ELAINE, What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.,121
6651,JERRY, Oh,121
6652,ELAINE," I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.",121
6653,JERRY," Well, Clyde might not tell him.",121
6654,ELAINE, How do you know that?,121
6655,JERRY, I should have helped Kramer with those packages.,121
6656,ELAINE, Ohh!,121
6657,KRAMER, Uh-huh.,121
6658,KRAMER, Yeah. Sure. Sure.,121
6659,KRAMER, Drive the horse?,121
6660,KRAMER," Oh, giddyup. Yeah.",121
6661,GEORGE," This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.",121
6662,GEORGE," It's, uh, it's not a little chicken.  Little chicken. It's a gamebird.",121
6663,GEORGE, Yeah.,121
6664,GEORGE," She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot.",121
6665,GEORGE, Why don't we talk about it another time.,121
6666,GEORGE, Did anybody see Firestorm?,121
6667,GEORGE, Yeah.,121
6668,GEORGE, Oh mother of God.,121
6669,KRAMER," Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!",121
6670,GEORGE, Thank God that's over.,121

7148,JERRY, Would you tell Susan about it?,124
7149,GEORGE,  Not necessarily.,124

7158,JERRY, You don't seem too bothered by it.,124
7159,KRAMER," You remember what they did to me ten years ago? ""Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one"", or ""We'll be there between two and six""!  And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors.  Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?",124
7160,JERRY," Boy, I've never seen you like this.",124
7161,KRAMER," Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.",124

7188,JERRY," Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.",124
7189,ELAINE," Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.",124
7190,JERRY," Ah, it's just money.",124
7191,ELAINE,"  So, when're you getting back from Florida?",124
7192,JERRY," Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?",124
7193,ELAINE," I don't know.  Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.",124
7194,JERRY, Are you okay?,124
7195,ELAINE,"  Sure, sure.",124
7196,JERRY, What was that?,124

7210,GEORGE," Yeah, what the hell?!",124
7211,ELAINE, George! It's cheating.,124
7212,GEORGE,  It's not cheating if there's no sex!,124

7233,JERRY, Just like that.,124
7234,JERRY, You wanna know? Come on outside.,124
7235,JERRY," C'mon, c'mon.",124
7236,JERRY," Well, what d'you think?",124
7237,JERRY, I bought it for you. It's yours.,124
7238,JERRY, I bought you a Cadillac.  Here you go.,124
7239,JERRY, What?,124
7240,JERRY, How d'you know?,124
7241,JERRY, Why can't I buy my father a car?,124
7242,JERRY,"  Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.",124
7243,JERRY, That's what I was thinking.,124
7244,JERRY," Hiya, Jack.",124
7245,JERRY, That's right. I bought it.,124
7246,JERRY, He doesn't wanna take a ride.,124
7247,JERRY, Aahh!,124
7248,GEORGE," Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.",124
7249,GEORGE," You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but  uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say.  Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say.  So, what d'you, what d'you think?",124
7250,GEORGE,"  Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?",124
7251,KRAMER, Y'hello.,124
7252,KRAMER," Hmm. Well, I haven't had any trouble.",124
7253,KRAMER,"  Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.",124
7254,KRAMER,"  Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.",124
7255,KRAMER, Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.,124
7256,KRAMER," Hey, McNab!",124
7257,KRAMER, Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?,124
7258,GEORGE,"  Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man.  Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner.  He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?",124
7259,GEORGE, Not in the last fifteen minutes.,124
7260,GEORGE," And I love you, Marisa.",124
7261,JERRY, Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.,124
7262,JERRY," You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!",124
7263,JERRY," Oh, hi Evelyn.",124
7264,JERRY, Who's she?,124
7265,JERRY, Hello?,125
7266,ELAINE,  Hi Jerry.,125
7267,JERRY, Elaine? Wh..what's going on?,125
7268,ELAINE,"  I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.",125
7269,JERRY,"  You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?",125
7270,ELAINE," Well, it's just two hours by plane...",125
7271,JERRY," Gee, I dunno what to tell you.",125
7272,ELAINE," Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.",125
7273,ELAINE, Yeah?,125
7274,GEORGE,  Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!,125
7275,ELAINE,"  Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.",125
7276,GEORGE, Yeahhh.,125
7277,ELAINE, Goodbye.,125
7278,ELAINE,  Hi.,125
7279,JERRY, Hi.,125
7280,ELAINE," So, what d'you think?",125
7281,JERRY," Uh, I don't think so.",125
7282,ELAINE,  Oh.,125
7283,JERRY, I'll be back on Monday.,125
7284,ELAINE," Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call.  Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.",125
7285,JERRY," Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you.",125
7286,ELAINE,  Jerry? Jerry?,125
7287,JERRY,  Yeah.,125
7288,ELAINE,  Bye.,125
7289,JERRY, Bye.,125
7290,KRAMER, Hello.,125
7291,KRAMER," Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it?",125
7292,KRAMER," Oh, you don't say.",125
7293,KRAMER,"  Ohh, you're good. You are really good.",125
7294,GEORGE," Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei!  And I wasn't even that nervous.",125
7295,GEORGE," You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...",125
7296,ELAINE,"  Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?",125
7297,GEORGE," Hey, where you going?",125
7298,ELAINE, I got stuff to do.,125
7299,GEORGE, What? You can't leave yet.,125
7300,ELAINE, Why not?,125
7301,GEORGE, We have to discuss my alibi.,125
7302,ELAINE, Alibi? What does that have to do with me?,125
7303,GEORGE," I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.",125
7304,ELAINE," Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?",125
7305,GEORGE, Yes.,125
7306,ELAINE,"  Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.",125
7307,GEORGE," Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?",125
7308,ELAINE, What is the difference?,125
7309,GEORGE," Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?",125
7310,GEORGE," Okay. Now, why do I have to see  you?",125
7311,ELAINE," Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.",125
7312,GEORGE,  It's no good.,125
7313,ELAINE,  Okay. Fine.,125
7314,GEORGE, What?,125
7315,ELAINE, I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.,125
7316,GEORGE," Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.",125
7317,ELAINE," I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.",125
7318,GEORGE,"  Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.",125
7319,ELAINE,  Okay.,125
7320,GEORGE, Alright?,125
7321,ELAINE, Okay.,125
7322,GEORGE, Okay.,125
7323,ELAINE, Fine.,125
7324,GEORGE, Good.,125
7325,ELAINE," Fine, fine, fine.",125
7326,GEORGE, Okay. How about this?,125
7327,ELAINE, What?,125
7328,GEORGE,  You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.,125
7329,ELAINE, I don't have a boyfriend.,125
7330,GEORGE,  She doesn't know that. We say that you do.,125
7331,ELAINE,  Ech.,125
7332,GEORGE, It's good. Believe me.,125
7333,ELAINE, I thought my idea was just as good.,125
7334,GEORGE, The dentist thing?,125
7335,ELAINE,"  Yeah, right. The dentist thing.",125
7336,GEORGE," Alright, the dentist thing was not good.",125
7337,ELAINE," Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?",125
7338,GEORGE,  Art Vandelay.,125
7339,ELAINE,  Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?,125
7340,GEORGE, That's your boyfriend.,125
7341,ELAINE, What does he do?,125
7342,GEORGE, He's an importer.,125
7343,ELAINE, Just imports? No exports?,125
7344,GEORGE,  He's an importer-exporter. Okay?,125
7345,ELAINE," Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?",125
7346,GEORGE,  Yes. Yes.,125
7347,ELAINE,  Yi-yi-yi.,125
7348,ELAINE," Ah!  How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?",125
7349,ELAINE,"  Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?",125
7350,GEORGE, It's very complicated.,125
7351,ELAINE,"  You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?",125
7352,JERRY, Gimme that rye!),125
7353,JERRY," Shut up, you old bag!",125
7354,JERRY, Nice to meet you.,125
7355,JERRY," Yeah, there's some sickos out there.",125
7356,JERRY, You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?,125
7357,JERRY,"  Well, it was nice meeting you.",125
7358,JERRY," Ah, I think I'll go.",125
7359,GEORGE, Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.,125
7360,GEORGE, I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.,125
7361,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.",125
7362,GEORGE, He's an importer-exporter.,125
7363,GEORGE,"  Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.",125
7364,GEORGE,"  Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.",125
7365,JERRY,  Dinner? W..What time is it?,125
7366,JERRY,  Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?,125
7367,JERRY, I don't understand why we have to eat now.,125
7368,JERRY," Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?",125
7369,JERRY,"  I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!",125
7370,GEORGE," ...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?",125
7371,GEORGE," What, you think I'm doing material here?",125
7372,GEORGE,  And I'm a little tired.,125
7373,GEORGE," Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.",125
7374,GEORGE," I'm, you know, engaged.",125
7375,JERRY, Jack.,125
7376,JERRY, Hi Doris.,125
7377,JERRY," Awright, let's eat already.",125
7378,ELAINE," Hi, Susan.",125
7379,ELAINE," Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.",125
7380,ELAINE," Oh, sure.",125
7381,ELAINE,"  Wha...?!  Ha ha ha. Ha, no.",125
7382,ELAINE,"  Don't be ridiculous!  I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...",125
7383,ELAINE," ...Well, obviously... You know...  Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?",125
7384,ELAINE,"  Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.",125
7385,ELAINE," Yeah, Art Vandelay.",125
7386,ELAINE,"  No, no.  Huh-hu-hu. It's okay.",125
7387,ELAINE, It is so forgotten.,125
7388,ELAINE," Okay.  Okay, no problem.",125
7389,ELAINE,"  Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful.  Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.",125
7390,ELAINE,"  Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.",125
7391,ELAINE, What'd I say?,125
7392,ELAINE,  I did. Uh...,125
7393,ELAINE,  Uh... chips.,125
7394,ELAINE, Potato.,125
7395,ELAINE,  Some corn.,125
7396,ELAINE, Diapers.,125
7397,ELAINE," Oh, no, it's okay.",125
7398,ELAINE, Okay.,125
7399,ELAINE,"  C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.",125
7400,GEORGE, Hi.,125
7401,GEORGE, Matches? Long matches.,125
7402,JERRY," Shut up, you old bag!",125
7403,JERRY," The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.",125
7404,ELAINE," Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.",126
7405,ELAINE, Right.,126
7406,GEORGE, You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.,126
7407,ELAINE," Oh, Come on.",126
7408,JERRY," Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?",126
7409,GEORGE," Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?",126
7410,JERRY," Yeah, sure. My parents will be there.",126
7411,ELAINE, The Tonight Show?,126
7412,JERRY," Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?",126
7413,ELAINE, Are you doing new material?,126
7414,JERRY, No.,126
7415,ELAINE, I don't think so.,126
7416,KRAMER, Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?,126
7417,JERRY," No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.",126
7418,KRAMER, Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.,126
7419,ELAINE, So what are your parents doing here in new York?,126
7420,JERRY," Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.",126
7421,ELAINE, So what are their plans?,126
7422,JERRY," Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.",126
7423,ELAINE, You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?,126
7424,JERRY," No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.",126
7425,GEORGE, Uncle Leo's having regular sex?,126
7426,JERRY," Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.",126
7427,JERRY,  Hello?,126
7428,JERRY, You gotta be there at 4,126
7429,JERRY," Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 11",126
7430,JERRY, 30 years.,126
7431,JERRY," All right, I'll see you later.",126
7432,ELAINE," Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?",126
7433,GEORGE," Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?",126
7434,JERRY," Yeah, it is.",126
7435,GEORGE," I mean, they're retired.",126
7436,JERRY, No economic reason for them to be here.,126
7437,GEORGE, They have no friends.,126
7438,JERRY, No social reason for them to be here.,126
7439,ELAINE, You're all grown up.,126
7440,GEORGE," Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.",126
7441,JERRY," I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?",126
7442,JERRY, You know Dad just called me.,126
7443,JERRY," Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.",126
7444,JERRY," All right, bye. ",126
7445,ELAINE, Ahh.,126
7446,JERRY," I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!",126
7447,ELAINE, They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?,126
7448,JERRY, The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.,126
7449,ELAINE, How's that gonna happen?,126
7450,JERRY,  Once a week?  So how's Lydia?,126
7451,JERRY, I don't know how you do it.,126
7452,JERRY," A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.",126
7453,JERRY, Well...,126
7454,JERRY," Hey, it happens.",126
7455,JERRY, He has no idea who you are.,126
7456,JERRY," All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, ""It's been real,"" move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.",126
7457,JERRY," Well, keep looking.",126
7458,ELAINE, What? Why not?,126
7459,ELAINE, Opium?,126
7460,ELAINE," Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.",126
7461,ELAINE," Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.",126
7462,ELAINE," Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman.  I'll be ready in three minutes.",126
7463,GEORGE," Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.",126
7464,GEORGE," You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.",126
7465,GEORGE," What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? ",126
7466,GEORGE," That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.",126
7467,GEORGE, What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.,126
7468,GEORGE, You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.,126
7469,GEORGE," Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.",126
7470,ELAINE, No?,126
7471,KRAMER, Jerry? Jerry!,126
7472,KRAMER," Wha, you too?",126
7473,JERRY, Yeah!,126
7474,KRAMER," These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.",126
7475,JERRY, Me either.,126
7476,KRAMER, If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.,126
7477,JERRY, You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.,126
7478,KRAMER,  Aw.,126
7479,JERRY, Where are you going?,126
7480,KRAMER, I gotta find another shower.,126
7481,KRAMER, They got you too?,126
7482,KRAMER," Oh, Elaine. Yeah.",126
7483,ELAINE," Kramer, you look terrible.",126
7484,KRAMER," Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.",126
7485,ELAINE, What's wrong with your shower?,126
7486,KRAMER, There's no water pressure.,126
7487,ELAINE, Why don't you just go see Jerry?,126
7488,KRAMER," Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.",126
7489,ELAINE, Mr Peterman! What are you doing?,126
7490,ELAINE, Huh?,126
7491,ELAINE," Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.",126
7492,JERRY, There's more food down the hall.,126
7493,JERRY," Oh, hi.",126
7494,JERRY," Actually, I'm drunk.",126
7495,GEORGE," Hey, hey, how was Florida?",126
7496,JERRY," I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.",126
7497,ELAINE," How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?",126
7498,ELAINE," I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.",126
7499,ELAINE, And the bush-women.,126
7500,ELAINE," Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.",126
7501,ELAINE,  Poppies!,126
7502,JERRY," Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo,  I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.",126
7503,JERRY," Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.",126
7504,JERRY," Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?",126
7505,KRAMER,"  Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.",126
7506,JERRY," Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?",126
7507,KRAMER," I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?",126
7508,JERRY, No good?,126
7509,KRAMER, It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.,126
7510,JERRY," Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?",126
7511,KRAMER," Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.",126
7512,JERRY,  Chicken?,126
7513,KRAMER," Oh, yeah.",126
7514,ELAINE," Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!",126
7515,JERRY, Poppy seeds!,126
7516,KRAMER," Well, that makes sense.  Want some chicken?",126
7517,ELAINE," Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.",126
7518,JERRY, Hello Newman.,126
7519,ELAINE," Oh c'mon, Newman.",126
7520,ELAINE, Jerry?,126
7521,JERRY, Not from the footage I've seen.,126
7522,KRAMER, I'm down.,126
7523,GEORGE, Big news?,126
7524,GEORGE,"  What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy!  For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?",126
7525,GEORGE, What do you mean?,126
7526,GEORGE, So you're moving there for spite!,126
7527,GEORGE," That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!",126
7528,GEORGE," Oh, every chance I get.",126
7529,GEORGE, Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!,126
7530,JERRY, What's going on?,126
7531,GEORGE, My parents are moving to Florida!,126
7532,JERRY, Are you kidding?,126
7533,GEORGE, Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!,126
7534,JERRY, Where are they moving to?,126
7535,GEORGE, Del Boca Vista!,126
7536,JERRY," Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!",126
7537,GEORGE, I know!,126
7538,JERRY, We could visit together!,126
7539,GEORGE, Every five years!,126
7540,JERRY, That's incredible!,126
7541,GEORGE," I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?",126
7542,JERRY, Why?,126
7543,GEORGE, To spite your parents!,126
7544,JERRY, To spite my parents?,126
7545,GEORGE, Yeah!,126
7546,JERRY, Your parents are crazy!,126
7547,GEORGE," I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!",126
7548,JERRY, My parents are moving back too!,126
7549,GEORGE, Beautiful!,126
7550,GEORGE, I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.,126
7551,JERRY, You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.,126
7552,JERRY, Hello.,126
7553,JERRY," Oh, hi dad.",126
7554,JERRY," Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?",126
7555,JERRY, But it's a big complex.,126
7556,JERRY," All right, fine. Come over here. ",126
7557,GEORGE, What?,126
7558,JERRY, They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.,126
7559,GEORGE, What? Why?,126
7560,JERRY, Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.,126
7561,GEORGE," Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.",126
7562,JERRY," You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.",126
7563,JERRY," C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody.",126
7564,JERRY," Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.",126
7565,JERRY, Can you blame her?,126
7566,ELAINE, Oh.,126
7567,ELAINE, Hello. Jerry's not here?,126
7568,ELAINE, Huh.  Oh my god.,126
7569,ELAINE," A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.",126
7570,ELAINE, It's a long story.,126
7571,ELAINE, What are you gonna do in there?,126
7572,ELAINE, You gotta do me a favor.,126
7573,ELAINE," Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.",126
7574,ELAINE, I need a clean urine sample from a woman.,126
7575,ELAINE," Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?",126
7576,ELAINE," Well, one of those glasses.",126
7577,ELAINE," Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.",126
7578,ELAINE," Yeah, a coffee cup's fine.",126
7579,ELAINE," Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.",126
7580,ELAINE, It doesn't matter.,126
7581,ELAINE," A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.",126
7582,ELAINE," Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!",126
7583,JERRY, What do you recommend?,126
7584,KRAMER," Power, man. Power.",126
7585,KRAMER, That's for radiation.,126
7586,KRAMER,"  Now, what is this?",126
7587,KRAMER," Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.",126
7588,KRAMER," He couldn't handle that, he's delicate.",126
7589,ELAINE, Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?,126
7590,ELAINE, What? Why not?,126
7591,ELAINE, But I wanted to see the bushmen.,126
7592,JERRY," Well, it's been a great visit.",126
7593,JERRY," Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.",126
7594,JERRY, You have no idea.,126
7595,JERRY, Thank you! Goodnight! ,127
7596,JERRY,  Hey. Hey!,127
7597,JERRY," Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?",127
7598,JERRY,"  Oh, thanks.",127
7599,JERRY,  I believe you.,127
7600,JERRY,"  Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.",127
7601,JERRY, Oh?,127
7602,JERRY, Uh-huh.,127
7603,GEORGE,  I am aware.,127
7604,GEORGE, A billiard parlor?,127
7605,GEORGE," Well, that's.. Elaine!",127
7606,ELAINE," Oh, hi, Frank.",127
7607,GEORGE,"  Sit down. Join us, please.",127
7608,ELAINE,"  Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.",127
7609,GEORGE,"  Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.",127
7610,ELAINE,"  Okay..  So..  Frank, did George ever show you that photo?",127
7611,GEORGE,  What photo?,127
7612,ELAINE," You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said ""Costanza""?",127
7613,ELAINE," I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.",127
7614,ELAINE, Who is that?,127
7615,GEORGE,"  When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.",127
7616,ELAINE," So, you weren't born here?",127
7617,GEORGE, I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-,127
7618,ELAINE," No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.",127
7619,ELAINE," He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.",127
7620,GEORGE, Really? Why?,127
7621,ELAINE,  Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.,127
7622,GEORGE, Who?,127
7623,ELAINE, You know the Three Tenors?,127
7624,GEORGE, Yeah..  Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.,127
7625,ELAINE,  The other guy.,127
7626,JERRY," Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.",127
7627,JERRY," Oh, okay..",127
7628,JERRY, Ohh.. look at this..,127
7629,KRAMER, What?,127
7630,JERRY, I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this,127
7631,KRAMER," Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..",127
7632,JERRY," I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.",127
7633,KRAMER,  I see..,127
7634,JERRY," No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.",127
7635,KRAMER," Well, why don't you do your material?",127
7636,JERRY, I'm out.,127
7637,KRAMER,"  Well, you better get to work.",127
7638,JERRY,  Thanks for the tip.,127
7639,GEORGE," Hey, buddies.",127
7640,JERRY," Hey. Hey, this is for you.  It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.",127
7641,GEORGE, Oh yeah..  Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.,127
7642,JERRY,  Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box.  What the hell are you doing?,127
7643,KRAMER,  I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? ,127
7644,JERRY,"  Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.",127
7645,KRAMER,"  Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?",127
7646,JERRY, Like what?,127
7647,KRAMER," Well, uh..  ""What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?""",127
7648,JERRY,  Where's the punchline?,127
7649,KRAMER, It's all attitude.. ,127
7650,GEORGE,"  Well, this is certainly a crappy gift..",127
7651,JERRY, A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!,127
7652,GEORGE," Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.",127
7653,JERRY, Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!,127
7654,KRAMER," Look, it's personalized.  ""The Costanzas""",127
7655,GEORGE," No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.",127
7656,KRAMER," Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.",127
7657,GEORGE, I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.,127
7658,KRAMER,"  Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..",127
7659,KRAMER," So, what's your game? What do you like to play?",127
7660,KRAMER," No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?",127
7661,KRAMER," Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..",127
7662,KRAMER, I'll break.,127
7663,GEORGE, What's all this?,127
7664,GEORGE,  More stuff..,127
7665,GEORGE, Oh my God! What is that?!,127
7666,GEORGE,  This doll  looks like my mother.,127
7667,GEORGE," I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!",127
7668,KRAMER,"  Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.",127
7669,KRAMER,  As soon as the game is over..,127
7670,KRAMER," Eleven, corner pocket. ",127
7671,GEORGE, What is this thing doing here?,127
7672,GEORGE," Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this..",127
7673,GEORGE, I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.,127
7674,JERRY," Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.",127
7675,ELAINE,  Oh yeah?,127
7676,JERRY," Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!",127
7677,ELAINE,"  Oh, that's dynamite.",127
7678,JERRY," Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?",127
7679,ELAINE, Who else is on the show?,127
7680,JERRY, Uh.. one of the three tenors.,127
7681,ELAINE,  The Three Tenors?  Which one?!,127
7682,JERRY, Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..,127
7683,ELAINE,  The other guy?!,127
7684,JERRY,"  Yeah, the other guy.",127
7685,ELAINE,  My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!,127
7686,JERRY, Why?,127
7687,ELAINE, Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?,127
7688,JERRY, Why not?,127
7689,ELAINE,  Wow! The other guy!,127
7690,JERRY," Hey, you look awful.",127
7691,GEORGE,"  I'm on no sleep, bro.",127
7692,JERRY, Problem in the bedroom?,127
7693,GEORGE,  Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.,127
7694,JERRY, Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?,127
7695,GEORGE,"  ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky.  It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.",127
7696,JERRY, I thought you didn't want the doormat.,127
7697,GEORGE, I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.,127
7698,JERRY," Sally?  Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?",127
7699,GEORGE," Yeah,  Susan said you'd be excited.",127
7700,JERRY, Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!,127
7701,ELAINE, Who's Sally?,127
7702,GEORGE, Susan's college roommate.,127
7703,JERRY, It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.,127
7704,GEORGE, So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.,127
7705,JERRY,"  I will - don't worry.  In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!",127
7706,ELAINE, That's sounds pretty juvenile.,127
7707,JERRY,  Hey! A dinosaur!,127
7708,KRAMER," Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.",127
7709,KRAMER, A billiard room.,127
7710,KRAMER,  What?,127
7711,KRAMER,  The Place To Be!,127
7712,KRAMER," Oh, yeah?",127
7713,KRAMER, Really?,127
7714,KRAMER, That's good thinking.,127
7715,GEORGE, You see?.. You see?!,127
7716,JERRY," Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.",127
7717,GEORGE," Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!",127
7718,JERRY, Why don't you just get rid of it?,127
7719,GEORGE," I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming.  Susan's so attached to this thing.",127
7720,JERRY," Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.",127
7721,GEORGE," Hi, Elaine.",127
7722,ELAINE, Did you see that?!,127
7723,JERRY, I'm just glad it's outta here.  What's that? ,127
7724,ELAINE," Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.",127
7725,JERRY, Oh.  Yeah?,127
7726,JERRY," Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?",127
7727,JERRY,"  Excellent.  So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?",127
7728,ELAINE,  No.,127
7729,JERRY, How come? I told you - It's fantastic.,127
7730,ELAINE," Eh, I like mine.",127
7731,JERRY," I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?",127
7732,ELAINE, I don't want it.,127
7733,JERRY,  I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.,127
7734,ELAINE,  It doesn't matter to me.,127
7735,JERRY, Come in.,127
7736,JERRY," Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.",127
7737,ELAINE, Hi.,127
7738,JERRY, How was your flight?  Pretty uncomfortable?,127
7739,JERRY,"  Oh..  Oh, wait..  This isn't the sauce that I asked for!",127
7740,JERRY,"  No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!",127
7741,JERRY, I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing.  Nothing!,127
7742,JERRY,  I don't have any material!,127
7743,ELAINE,  He's got nothin'!,127
7744,GEORGE,  Don't tell me how to eat!,127
7745,GEORGE,"  Because I like this one!  C'mon, let's go. Let's go!  Oh, hi.. ",127
7746,KRAMER," Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.",127
7747,KRAMER, Come on. Are you sure?,127
7748,KRAMER," Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot.",127
7749,KRAMER,"  Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.",127
7750,KRAMER," Right here, come on, I'll show you..  Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..",127
7751,JERRY,  That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.,127
7752,ELAINE," Well, have you ever considered writing new material?",127
7753,JERRY," Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.",127
7754,ELAINE,  Me? Are you talking about me?,127
7755,JERRY,  No. You're never here.,127
7756,ELAINE,"  Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?",127
7757,JERRY," Yeah. Really.  Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.",127
7758,ELAINE, What?,127
7759,JERRY, Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny.  I'm gonna call them.,127
7760,JERRY," Hello, Susan? It's Jerry.",127
7761,JERRY,  Oh. Is George there?,127
7762,JERRY," Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.",127
7763,JERRY,  Yes.,127
7764,KRAMER," Yeah..  See? This is no good..  Hey, the baton.  I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss.  13 in the side pocket.  Giddy-up.  Six in the corner.  This table's mine.  You know where it's going..",127
7765,ELAINE, Hey!,127
7766,JERRY, Hey!,127
7767,ELAINE, Is George here?,127
7768,JERRY, Not yet.  The other guy.,127
7769,ELAINE," It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?",127
7770,ELAINE,"  Oh, thank you so much.  Thank you so much, Mr..  Camaro.  Mr. Casea?  Well, whatever.  I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.",127
7771,JERRY,"  Well, that's one hell of a gig.  Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!",127
7772,ELAINE,  Ohh.. thank you.  Huh..  Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?,127
7773,JERRY," Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.",127
7774,ELAINE,  How am I supposed to carry this thing?  What are you doing?,127
7775,JERRY," Well, I want to sit down.",127
7776,ELAINE, So?,127
7777,JERRY, It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. ,127
7778,KRAMER,"  Aw, beautiful!",127
7779,JERRY,  Where's George?,127
7780,JERRY,  No! That's the wrong doll!,127
7781,JERRY,  This is a nightmare.,127
7782,JERRY, My pants!,127
7783,ELAINE," I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.",127
7784,ELAINE," No, no, no. Not the toothbrush..  this.",127
7785,ELAINE," Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..",127
7786,ELAINE," Oh, ok! ",127
7787,GEORGE, I just wanted a second opinion.,127
7788,GEORGE,  I told you it looked like her..,127
7789,JERRY,"The other thing I love is when you're in the middle of a dream, and the alarm goes off. You incorporate the sound of the alarm into the dream, so you can keep sleeping. And you'll make any adjustment in the dream to do it. I was with Marie Antoinette in a dream last night, and she was on the guillotine, the blade came down, her head fell into the basket, it rolled over and she started singing Neil Diamond's 'Solitary Man'. And, I thought, ""That is not my alarm going off. This is actually happening.""",128
7790,GEORGE,  June. It's June.,128
7791,GEORGE,  Hey!,128
7792,GEORGE, It's June. Mark's Michelle is a dog.,128
7793,GEORGE," June, June, June.",128
7794,GEORGE,"  Hey, he-hah. It's June, June.",128
7795,GEORGE, It's Juu-uu-une! Hey hay. Yes.,128
7796,GEORGE, I love Juu-uuu-uu-uune!,128
7797,GEORGE," June. Juune, baby!",128
7798,JERRY, What?,128
7799,GEORGE, The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.,128
7800,JERRY, Dead man walking.,128
7801,GEORGE,  Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.,128
7802,JERRY," Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.",128
7803,GEORGE," Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.",128
7804,JERRY, She did?,128
7805,GEORGE, Yeah.,128
7806,JERRY, So? Wheels?,128
7807,GEORGE, In motion. The wheels are in motion.,128
7808,JERRY, Beautiful.,128
7809,GEORGE," Aah, hey.  If this works out, forget about it. Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good as if I didn't get married.",128
7810,JERRY," So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.",128
7811,GEORGE, The Friars Club?,128
7812,JERRY," Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.",128
7813,KRAMER," Hey everybody.  Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright?",128
7814,JERRY, Catnap?,128
7815,KRAMER," No, no, no, no.  This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?",128
7816,JERRY,  That must be some book.,128
7817,KRAMER," Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years.",128
7818,JERRY, Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.,128
7819,KRAMER," Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.",128
7820,JERRY, I didn't know you had a hopper.,128
7821,KRAMER,"  Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.",128

7830,GEORGE," Hup, here we go. Here we go.",128
7831,GEORGE,"  Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard",128
7832,JERRY,  That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.,128
7833,GEORGE,"  Oh, get outta here.",128
7834,JERRY,"  I mean, come on.  No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.",128
7835,GEORGE,"  You watch the old videos.  I'm telling you, look at him.",128
7836,JERRY," Oh, come on.",128
7837,GEORGE, Look...,128

7845,JERRY,"  Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.",128
7846,KRAMER," Yeah, I like that crest.  Alright, here we go.",128
7847,JERRY, Breakfast?,128
7848,KRAMER,  Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.,128
7849,JERRY, So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?,128
7850,KRAMER,"  Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea.  A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. ",128
7851,JERRY, What d'you call it?,128
7852,KRAMER, P B and J's. What d'you think?,128
7853,JERRY,  I think you need more sleep.,128
7854,KRAMER,  Ahh.,128
7855,JERRY," So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?",128
7856,KRAMER," I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.",128
7857,JERRY," Oh, now you're being ridiculous.",128
7858,KRAMER,"  He he, yeah.",128
7859,JERRY,  No milk?,128
7860,KRAMER," Oh, I'll be back.",128

7869,KRAMER, Yeah.,128
7870,JERRY," Well, what's wrong with you?",128
7871,KRAMER," I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?",128
7872,JERRY, No. Would you just get out?,128
7873,KRAMER, You wanna rent a movie?,128
7874,JERRY, No!,128
7875,KRAMER," Well, what am I gonna do?",128
7876,JERRY, Ready for lunch?,128
7877,ELAINE,"  I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.",128
7878,ELAINE," Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.",128
7879,JERRY, You think he's faking?,128
7880,ELAINE," I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.",128
7881,ELAINE," Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?",128
7882,ELAINE,  I'm kind of swamped.,128
7883,ELAINE," Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?",128
7884,JERRY, That was him?,128
7885,ELAINE, Yes.,128
7886,JERRY, Somehow I thought he'd be taller.,128
7887,ELAINE," Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.",128
7888,JERRY,"  Alright, I'll see you later.",128

7903,JERRY," Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.",128
7904,ELAINE,  And?,128
7905,JERRY," Well, he flinched, sort of.",128
7906,ELAINE," What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?",128
7907,JERRY," Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.",128
7908,ELAINE, So you don't know anything?,128
7909,JERRY," Actually, no.",128
7910,ELAINE,"  Alright, good job.",128
7911,JERRY, Right.,128
7912,JERRY, Come in.,128

7916,JERRY,  Fantastic. Fantastic woman.,128
7917,GEORGE, I told you.,128
7918,JERRY, I'm nuts about her.,128
7919,GEORGE, You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?,128
7920,JERRY, She could be an 'it'.,128
7921,GEORGE,  We might have an 'it'!,128
7922,JERRY, She's got 'it' written all over her.,128
7923,GEORGE," She's got everything, right?  She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.",128
7924,JERRY," Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.",128
7925,GEORGE," Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.",128
7926,JERRY, Whatever.,128
7927,GEORGE,"  Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?",128
7928,JERRY, That doesn't sound right.,128
7929,GEORGE," No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.",128
7930,JERRY, Flying Sandos. Beautiful.,128
7931,GEORGE," Great. Seven-thirty, alright?",128
7932,JERRY, Walk me down to the Friars.,128
7933,GEORGE," Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...",128
7934,JERRY, It's not here.,128

7944,JERRY,  Great.,128
7945,KRAMER,  Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.,128

7947,KRAMER," Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.",128
7948,JERRY, Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.,128

7968,JERRY,  I don't think so.,128
7969,JERRY, My jacket?,128
7970,GEORGE, Give him the jacket.,128
7971,JERRY,  Alright.,128
7972,GEORGE, This is very exciting. The inner sanctum.,128
7973,JERRY, Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.,128
7974,JERRY,"  I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.",128
7975,JERRY," Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.",128
7976,JERRY, It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.,128
7977,JERRY,  I'm sure it won't.,128
7978,GEORGE,"  Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back.  So, let's go get some coffee, huh?",128
7979,JERRY,"  No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.",128
7980,GEORGE, Really?,128
7981,JERRY," Yeah, we'll do it another time.",128
7982,GEORGE," I, uh, oh, broke a shoelace today.",128

7994,ELAINE,"  Of course, Mr Peterman.",128
7995,JERRY,"  Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye.  Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!",128
7996,JERRY,"  Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!",128
7997,GEORGE," It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.",128
7998,JERRY,"  Uhh, I don't think so.",128
7999,GEORGE,  Why not?,128

8005,GEORGE, Don't be soured.,128
8006,JERRY, I'm sorry. I'm soured.,128
8007,GEORGE,  What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?,128
8008,JERRY," Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.",128
8009,GEORGE,  What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.,128
8010,JERRY,"  Yeah, we'll see.",128
8011,GEORGE,"  Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?",128
8012,JERRY, I'll try and de-sour.,128
8013,GEORGE,"  Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!",128
8014,JERRY,  I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.,128
8015,GEORGE, I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.,128
8016,JERRY, I still don't know what that means.,128
8017,GEORGE,"  Yeah, well.",128

8023,JERRY, What'd she do?,128
8024,KRAMER," I don't know!  But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.",128
8025,JERRY,  Why would she try and kill you?,128
8026,KRAMER,"  Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!",128
8027,KRAMER,  Gah!,128
8028,JERRY," Hey, there's uncle Milty.",128
8029,GEORGE,"  Yeah, it is.",128

8383,ELAINE,  Whose tonsils grow back? ,13
8384,JERRY," Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.",13
8385,ELAINE," I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.",13
8386,JERRY,"  Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.",13
8387,GEORGE,  Excuse me!,13
8388,GEORGE, What? You mean with a knife?,13
8389,GEORGE,"  Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.",13
8390,ELAINE,"  Oh, I'm sorry.  I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. ",13
8391,JERRY, Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.,13
8392,KRAMER, Hey.,13
8393,JERRY, Hey.,13
8394,KRAMER," Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital!  So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.",13
8395,JERRY,  Kramer.,13
8396,KRAMER," The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.",13
8397,JERRY," Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.",13
8398,KRAMER, No? That's good.,13
8399,GEORGE, I have to have my tonsils taken out.,13
8400,KRAMER," Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.",13
8401,JERRY,  It's routine surgery.,13
8402,KRAMER," Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, ""My name is Bob"" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..",13
8403,GEORGE," Well, what should I do, Kramer?",13
8404,JERRY," Well, for one think, don't listen to him.",13
8405,KRAMER," I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.",13
8406,JERRY, Eckman? I thought he was doing time?,13
8407,KRAMER," No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.",13
8408,JERRY," A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.",13
8409,KRAMER," He's holistic, George. He's holistic.",13
8410,GEORGE, Holistic.. that sounds right.,13
8411,JERRY," George, you need a medical doctor.",13
8412,GEORGE,  Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?,13
8413,JERRY," Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.",13
8414,GEORGE, Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?,13
8415,KRAMER, First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.,13
8416,GEORGE," Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.",13
8417,GEORGE," So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?",13
8418,JERRY," Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.",13
8419,GEORGE," All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.",13
8420,JERRY,  I've never had a really good pickle.,13
8421,GEORGE," Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?",13
8422,JERRY, Sorry.,13
8423,GEORGE, April.,13
8424,GEORGE, Really?,13
8425,GEORGE, Yes.,13
8426,GEORGE, ..Okay.,13
8427,KRAMER, I'm off hot water.,13
8428,GEORGE," Yes, yes I am.",13
8429,GEORGE,  Can I use hot water on my face?,13
8430,JERRY,"  And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.",13
8431,GEORGE,  What about shaving?,13
8432,GEORGE, I guess so.,13
8433,JERRY,  There's some hot air blowing in here..,13
8434,GEORGE,  Could it be lukewarm?,13
8435,JERRY, Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?,13
8436,ELAINE, Uh-huh.,13
8437,JERRY, I love crampbark.,13
8438,JERRY," Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.",13
8439,JERRY," Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.",13
8440,KRAMER," Go ahead, drink it, George.",13
8441,JERRY," Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-",13
8442,KRAMER," Go ahead, drink it, George.",13
8443,GEORGE,"  Hey, it's not too bad..",13
8444,GEORGE,  I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!,13
8445,JERRY,  Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.,13
8446,GEORGE, My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!,13
8447,JERRY,  I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?,13
8448,JERRY, You're gonna fight?,13
8449,GEORGE, Now?! I'm a mutant!,13
8450,KRAMER,"  Hey, let me drive.",13
8451,JERRY,"  Really, gentlemen, please.",13
8452,GEORGE, My heart! My heart!  Where you going? Are you crazy?!,13
8453,KRAMER,"  Hey, you have keys?",13
8454,GEORGE, You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!,13
8455,JERRY, All this for a Chuckle.,13
8456,KRAMER, What's a Chuckle?,13
8457,JERRY, It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.,13
8458,ELAINE, Can you let go of my tongue now?,13
8459,ELAINE, Let go of my tongue!,13
8460,ELAINE," Well, I should get going..  What are you doing?",13
8461,ELAINE," A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. ",13
8462,JERRY, You just can't leave him out there.,13
8463,KRAMER," Well, can you call him an ambulance?",13
8464,KRAMER," hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!",13
8465,JERRY, Watch out!,13
8466,KRAMER, Watch out!,13
8467,JERRY," How ya doing?  Can't talk?  Hey, how'd you get the plastic one?  I like that.  So how's life without tonsils?  What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?..  Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy..  What are you doing?",13
8468,ELAINE," Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something.  Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.",13
8469,JERRY," Hey, check the TV.",13
8470,JERRY,  That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.,13
8471,JERRY," I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. ""Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life."" Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, ""I had a heart attack this big  ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear!  Brrhht.. and it's gone!""",13
8472,GEORGE," I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors......",130
8473,GEORGE," It's a calzone, sir.",130
8474,GEORGE," Uh. Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant.",130
8475,ELAINE, One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.,130
8476,JERRY, What bet?,130
8477,ELAINE, He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.,130
8478,JERRY, Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.,130
8479,ELAINE, That's what I said.,130
8480,JERRY, So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?,130
8481,ELAINE, Yeah.,130
8482,JERRY, Huh.,130
8483,ELAINE, What?,130
8484,JERRY, No. nothing.,130
8485,JERRY, What's with you?,130
8486,KRAMER, Feel this.,130
8487,JERRY, Wow.That's hot.,130
8488,KRAMER, Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants.,130
8489,ELAINE, I'll see you later.,130
8490,KRAMER, Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer.,130
8491,JERRY, So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.,130
8492,KRAMER," Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later?",130
8493,JERRY, I got a date with Nikki.,130
8494,KRAMER, Oh yeah she's a beauty.,130
8495,JERRY, She's also quite bold.,130
8496,KRAMER, Oh bold and beautiful.,130
8497,GEORGE, You know a lost and found could be a good idea.,130
8498,GEORGE, Definitely.,130
8499,JERRY," Hey, Elaine.",130
8500,ELAINE, Hi Jerry!,130
8501,JERRY, This is Nikki.,130
8502,ELAINE, Hello. This is Todd Gack.,130
8503,JERRY, Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.,130
8504,ELAINE, So what movie are you guys seeing?,130
8505,ELAINE," Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see""Blame it on the Rain""",130
8506,JERRY, Why don't you see what you can do?,130
8507,ELAINE, What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.,130
8508,JERRY, We'll see.,130
8509,JERRY, Yeah. Why?,130
8510,JERRY," Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.",130
8511,JERRY, Sure. If there cheap Why not.,130
8512,JERRY, Told you.,130
8513,ELAINE, How did you do that?,130
8514,JERRY," All right. Enjoy""Blame it on the Rain""",130
8515,GEORGE, There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.,130
8516,JERRY, There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.,130
8517,GEORGE, Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.,130
8518,JERRY, With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.,130
8519,GEORGE, So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.,130
8520,JERRY, So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.,130
8521,GEORGE, Not bills.,130
8522,JERRY, So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.,130
8523,GEORGE, Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.,130
8524,JERRY, She's like a beautiful Godzilla.,130
8525,GEORGE, Without thousands of fleeing Japanese.,130
8526,KRAMER, Hey buddy.,130
8527,JERRY, What the hell is all this?,130
8528,KRAMER, I am looking for quarters for the dryer.,130
8529,JERRY, Why can't you do this on your table?,130
8530,KRAMER, Because I don't have a table.,130
8531,ELAINE, Hey.,130
8532,JERRY," Hey. So how was""Blame it on the Rain?""",130
8533,ELAINE, Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.,130
8534,JERRY, Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?,130
8535,ELAINE, No. We were both in the mood for one.,130
8536,JERRY," You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....",130
8537,ELAINE, Oh is that so.,130
8538,JERRY, Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.,130
8539,ELAINE, What are you talking about?,130
8540,JERRY, Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner,130
8541,ELAINE, If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.,130
8542,JERRY, Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.,130
8543,ELAINE, I don't buy it.,130
8544,JERRY, So what happened after the movie?,130
8545,ELAINE, Nothing. He walked me home.,130
8546,JERRY, To the door?,130
8547,ELAINE, Yeah.,130
8548,JERRY, That's a date.,130
8549,ELAINE, No it's not.,130
8550,JERRY, But I never walk you home.,130
8551,ELAINE, That's just because your a jackass.,130
8552,KRAMER, Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?,130
8553,JERRY," No, no.",130
8554,ELAINE," No, no.",130
8555,JERRY, So how did you leave it with him?,130
8556,ELAINE, I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.,130
8557,JERRY, That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.,130
8558,ELAINE, Your crazy!,130
8559,JERRY, Crazy like a man.,130
8560,GEORGE, You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!,130
8561,GEORGE, And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. ,130
8562,GEORGE, No no. That's not what I was trying to do.,130
8563,GEORGE, I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner.,130
8564,GEORGE, I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.,130
8565,GEORGE, How about Chinese?,130
8566,GEORGE, I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.,130
8567,ELAINE, Thanks for the dinner.,130
8568,ELAINE, Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?,130
8569,ELAINE, I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?,130
8570,ELAINE," Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight.",130
8571,ELAINE, See what is that? Is that a date?,130
8572,ELAINE, All right. I am sorry it's not a date.,130
8573,ELAINE, All right.,130
8574,JERRY, I was got to be 55.,130
8575,JERRY, A lot faster than that!,130
8576,JERRY, Okay dokey,130
8577,JERRY, Absolutely. Nikki!,130
8578,JERRY, Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?,130
8579,JERRY, You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.,130
8580,JERRY, All right Nik. That's it.,130
8581,KRAMER, Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.,130
8582,JERRY, You got your shirt in my oven!?!,130
8583,KRAMER, I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.,130
8584,JERRY, For both of us.,130
8585,KRAMER, And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.,130
8586,JERRY, What's wrong with your oven?,130
8587,KRAMER, I am baking a pie!,130
8588,JERRY, Yeah.,130
8589,GEORGE, Yeah.,130
8590,JERRY, Come on up.,130
8591,KRAMER," You got cigars, huh.",130
8592,JERRY, I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!,130
8593,KRAMER," Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?""Perducto de Peru""Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.",130
8594,JERRY, Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!,130
8595,KRAMER, You got ripped buddy.,130
8596,JERRY, I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.,130
8597,KRAMER, That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch?  Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma. Hey George hey.,130
8598,GEORGE, Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.,130
8599,JERRY, so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?,130
8600,GEORGE, What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.,130
8601,JERRY, Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?,130
8602,GEORGE, Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.,130
8603,JERRY, No. I never had a job.,130
8604,KRAMER, I decided to go with the brown one 's. ,130
8605,GEORGE, What the hell is this?,130
8606,JERRY, Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.,130
8607,GEORGE, There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.,130
8608,KRAMER, Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?,130
8609,GEORGE, Yeah. You've heard of it?,130
8610,KRAMER, Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.,130
8611,GEORGE, I'll see you guys later.,130
8612,JERRY, What kind of pie are you cooking?,130
8613,KRAMER, Huckleberry.,130
8614,GEORGE, Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.,130
8615,GEORGE, Are you going to help me or not?,130
8616,GEORGE, What?,130
8617,GEORGE, All right.,130
8618,GEORGE, That's a little steep don't you think?,130
8619,GEORGE," All right, all right.",130
8620,GEORGE, But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.,130
8621,ELAINE, This is nice.,130
8622,ELAINE, Party of four? Who are we meeting?,130
8623,ELAINE, Hellllllooooo.,130
8624,ELAINE, What the hell was that?,130
8625,ELAINE, Why did you introduce me to your parents?,130
8626,ELAINE," Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.",130
8627,ELAINE, Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.,130
8628,ELAINE, Well if it's not a date then what is it?,130
8629,ELAINE, I don't believe this.,130
8630,ELAINE, No. I'll just walk home.,130
8631,ELAINE, Now what was that?,130
8632,GEORGE, Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?,130
8633,GEORGE, Soooooo,130
8634,GEORGE," You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman.""Neither rain nor sleet nor snow.....""It's the first one.",130
8635,GEORGE, You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!,130
8636,GEORGE, But I'm paying you!,130
8637,GEORGE, Newman!!,130
8638,JERRY, I did.,130
8639,JERRY, Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.,130
8640,GEORGE, Kramer!,130
8641,KRAMER, Hey you!,130
8642,GEORGE, Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.,130
8643,KRAMER, What happened to Newman?,130
8644,GEORGE, He called in sick.,130
8645,KRAMER, Oh yeah right it's raining.,130
8646,GEORGE, Can you do it?,130
8647,KRAMER, What time do you need it at?,130

8654,KRAMER, All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.,130
8655,KRAMER, Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.,130
8656,ELAINE, Hey Todd.,130
8657,ELAINE, Yeah sure.,130
8658,ELAINE, Milhouse.,130
8659,KRAMER, Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.,130
8660,KRAMER, That's all I got.,130
8661,KRAMER, I told you this is all I got.,130
8662,GEORGE, What happened? Where have you been?,130
8663,KRAMER, The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.,130
8664,GEORGE, What the hell happened to your shirt?,130
8665,KRAMER, He overcooked it. It's ruined.,130
8666,GEORGE, Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.,130
8667,JERRY, Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.,130
8668,ELAINE, These are terrible.,130
8669,JERRY, It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.,130
8670,ELAINE, What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.,130
8671,JERRY, I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.,130
8672,ELAINE, Where are you going?,130
8673,JERRY, I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.,130
8674,ELAINE, But she broke up with you.,130
8675,JERRY," I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.",130
8676,ELAINE, It smells like a rubber fire.,130
8677,JERRY,What's that?,130
8678,ELAINE, I said rubber fire.,130
8679,JERRY, Oh.,130
8680,ELAINE, Did you ever pay Todd for these things?,130
8681,JERRY, Actually it's being taken care of right now.,130
8682,KRAMER, You Gack?,130
8683,KRAMER, Here's your money.,130
8684,GEORGE, Because they were heated up there.,130
8685,JERRY,"I love it when you get your car back from the car place, and it's got that paper mat on the floor. Like they're so obsessed with cleanliness, they don't even want their shoes to touch the carpet. Meanwhile, the mechanic comes out; he looks like Al Jolson. He's covered in goo, from head to toe. You can't even see him. Although, I prefer that to when they have the lab coat, The clipboard and the nice glasses. Now you know you're getting screwed.  'Can I see it?'  'You better not. It's idling quietly right now. I think it should stay overnight. We wanna keep an eye on it, and we wanna keep the bill running up.'",131
8686,GEORGE," Sorry, the players will be reimbursed?",131
8687,GEORGE," Sorry, Mr Wilhelm.",131
8688,GEORGE," I know, sir. It won't happen again.",131
8689,ELAINE," Hi, Mr Peterman.",131
8690,ELAINE, I do.,131
8691,ELAINE, The pygmy pullover.,131
8692,ELAINE, Whatever.,131
8693,ELAINE," Oh.  Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing?  I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?",131
8694,ELAINE, Wow.,131
8695,GEORGE," Yes, sir.",131
8696,GEORGE," I will, sir. Top priority.",131
8697,GEORGE, Top priority.,131
8698,GEORGE," So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.",131
8699,JERRY, He pulled an LBJ on you.,131
8700,GEORGE, LBJ?,131
8701,JERRY," Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.",131
8702,GEORGE, No kidding?,131
8703,JERRY, Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.,131
8704,GEORGE," Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.",131
8705,JERRY, Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.,131
8706,GEORGE," I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.",131
8707,JERRY," You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.",131
8708,GEORGE," Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work.",131
8709,KRAMER, Hey buddy.,131
8710,JERRY, Hey.,131
8711,GEORGE, Hey.,131
8712,JERRY, Can I have my keys...,131
8713,KRAMER,  Yeah.,131
8714,JERRY,"  ...back, please?",131
8715,KRAMER," You shoulda come, Jerry.",131
8716,GEORGE, Where'd you go?,131
8717,KRAMER, Price club.,131
8718,GEORGE, Why didn't you take your car?,131
8719,KRAMER," Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.",131
8720,KRAMER, What're you doing.  Don't throw that away.,131
8721,KRAMER," You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here.  Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund,  vrrup, five cents.",131
8722,KRAMER, Yes.,131
8723,JERRY," Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?",131
8724,GEORGE," Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?",131
8725,JERRY, No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.,131
8726,GEORGE," Awright, I'll see you later.",131
8727,KRAMER, That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.,131
8728,KRAMER, Yeah.,131
8729,KRAMER," No, it doesn't work.",131
8730,KRAMER," Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.",131
8731,JERRY,"  Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?",131
8732,KRAMER," No, no, I'm off that.",131
8733,KRAMER, Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.,131
8734,JERRY,  You two keep an eye on each other?,131
8735,JERRY, Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.,131
8736,ELAINE," No, I didn't hear anything.  Oh, my God, look who's here.",131
8737,JERRY," Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.",131
8738,ELAINE, Hi Sue Ellen.,131
8739,JERRY, Hi Sue Ellen.,131
8740,ELAINE,"  Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.",131
8741,JERRY, I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.,131
8742,ELAINE,  I... hate that woman.,131
8743,KRAMER," No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.",131
8744,ELAINE,"  Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.",131
8745,ELAINE,  What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now?  Eighty-five hundred!,131
8746,JERRY, Think she wants those clubs.,131
8747,ELAINE, Ninety-five hundred.,131
8748,JERRY," Well, that's your ceiling.",131
8749,ELAINE,  Eleven thousand!,131
8750,ELAINE,  Thirteen thousand!,131
8751,ELAINE,  Fifteen thousand!!,131
8752,ELAINE, Peterman is gonna kill me.,131
8753,JERRY, I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.,131
8754,ELAINE, Why didn't you stop me?,131
8755,JERRY, Do you hear this clunking?,131
8756,ELAINE,  A little.,131
8757,ELAINE," Oh. You know what?  I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.",131
8758,JERRY, Okay.,131
8759,ELAINE," Alrighty, bye.",131
8760,JERRY, Bye.,131
8761,JERRY, What's going on here?,131
8762,JERRY, Oh God!,131
8763,JERRY,"  Oh, you idiots!",131
8764,KRAMER," Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon.  Hey, there he is.",131
8765,JERRY, Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?,131
8766,KRAMER,"  Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.",131
8767,JERRY," And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?",131
8768,KRAMER, We ran outta space.,131
8769,JERRY, Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.,131
8770,KRAMER," Ah, Tony, he's good.",131
8771,JERRY," Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.",131
8772,KRAMER,  'Choke?',131
8773,JERRY," No, thank you.",131
8774,JERRY," Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...",131
8775,JERRY, There's really nothing wrong on the inside.,131
8776,JERRY," No, I hadn't noticed.",131
8777,JERRY, Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.,131
8778,JERRY, The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.,131
8779,JERRY, Try to.,131
8780,ELAINE," I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them.  You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...",131
8781,ELAINE,  They should be here today.,131
8782,GEORGE," Uh, Mr Wilhelm.",131
8783,GEORGE," Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment.",131
8784,GEORGE," Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?",131
8785,GEORGE," Well, I was wondering...",131
8786,GEORGE," Payroll? No, no, I haven't done that.",131
8787,GEORGE, Payroll!!,131
8788,GEORGE, Hello there. I'm George Costanza.,131
8789,GEORGE," Assistant to the travelling secretary.  I'm uh, working on the project.",131
8790,GEORGE," Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.",131
8791,GEORGE," You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while.  I'll just browse around.",131
8792,GEORGE," Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.",131
8793,GEORGE,"  You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here.  Then you can tell me.",131
8794,GEORGE, So he explained it all to you?,131
8795,GEORGE, What'd he tell you?,131
8796,KRAMER, Wha...?,131
8797,KRAMER," Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.",131
8798,KRAMER,  Uh-huh.,131
8799,KRAMER,  Mother's Day.,131
8800,KRAMER," A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.",131
8801,KRAMER," Newman, you magnificent bastard, you did it!",131
8802,GEORGE,"  Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.",131
8803,GEORGE," Oh, yeah. Downtown. Definitely.",131
8804,GEORGE,"  Yeah, you said it.  Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?",131
8805,GEORGE, The song?,131
8806,GEORGE,  Downtown.,131
8807,JERRY, The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?,131
8808,GEORGE, Yeah.,131
8809,JERRY, You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?,131
8810,GEORGE," I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.",131
8811,JERRY," Okay, so how does it go?",131
8812,GEORGE," 'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'",131
8813,JERRY, '... downtown.',131
8814,GEORGE," 'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'",131
8815,JERRY, '...downtown.',131
8816,GEORGE," Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?",131
8817,JERRY, Seven-eleven?,131
8818,GEORGE," 'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?",131
8819,JERRY," No, that's midtown.",131
8820,GEORGE," 'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'",131
8821,JERRY, '...down town.',131
8822,GEORGE," 'Things'll be great, when you're...'",131
8823,JERRY, '...downtown.',131
8824,GEORGE," I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing.",131
8825,JERRY," Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'",131
8826,GEORGE," You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?",131
8827,JERRY, How can you lose?,131
8828,JERRY, Hello.,131
8829,ELAINE," Hi, it's me.",131
8830,JERRY," Oh, hi.",131
8831,ELAINE," Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.",131
8832,JERRY," Oh, you know what?",131
8833,ELAINE,  Oh no. What?,131
8834,JERRY," Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.",131
8835,ELAINE, You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?,131
8836,JERRY, I forgot.,131
8837,ELAINE," Oh, go down and get them.",131
8838,JERRY, I can't. The car's at the mechanics.,131
8839,ELAINE," Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.",131
8840,JERRY," No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?",131
8841,ELAINE,"  Ugh, okay, alright, fine.",131
8842,JERRY," Hey, Tony.",131
8843,JERRY, Sure.,131
8844,JERRY," Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...",131
8845,JERRY, I really wanna...,131
8846,JERRY, How much money is this gonna cost me?,131
8847,JERRY, The washer fluid is fine.,131
8848,JERRY," Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.",131
8849,JERRY," Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.",131
8850,JERRY," Well, just get it down.",131
8851,JERRY," Okay. Thank you, very much.",131
8852,ELAINE, Hey. Where's the car?,131
8853,JERRY, He's bringing it.,131
8854,ELAINE, Good.,131
8855,JERRY," Okay, thank you. ",132
8856,ELAINE, So? What'd they say?,132
8857,JERRY, They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.,132
8858,ELAINE, What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!,132
8859,JERRY," Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?",132
8860,ELAINE, What kind of maniac is this guy?,132
8861,JERRY, He's a very special maniac.,132
8862,ELAINE, What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.,132
8863,JERRY, I don't know.,132
8864,ELAINE, Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!,132
8865,ELAINE," Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.",132
8866,ELAINE, It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.,132
8867,ELAINE, They happened to be in the back seat at the time.,132
8868,JERRY," You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?",132
8869,JERRY, Had I been taking...?,132
8870,JERRY," W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.",132
8871,JERRY, Not that I would think of doing such things.,132
8872,JERRY," Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks.",132
8873,GEORGE,"  Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...",132
8874,GEORGE, I did?,132
8875,JERRY," I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.",132
8876,GEORGE," Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.",132
8877,GEORGE," The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?",132
8878,JERRY, No. The police have no leads  and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.,132
8879,GEORGE, Why not?,132
8880,JERRY," They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.",132
8881,ELAINE,  Hey.,132
8882,GEORGE, Hey.,132
8883,ELAINE,  Hey. What did the detective say?,132
8884,JERRY, They're looking.,132
8885,GEORGE, I gotta go.,132
8886,JERRY, Y'hello.,132
8887,JERRY, Yeah.,132
8888,JERRY," Yeah, okay.  They may have found the car.",132
8889,ELAINE,  Are the clubs in it? Ask him.,132
8890,JERRY, Are there golf clubs in the back?,132
8891,JERRY,  This is Elaine Benes.,132
8892,ELAINE,"  We used to date, but now we're just friends.",132
8893,JERRY, Yeah.,132
8894,JERRY," Well, what's going on? What is this thing?",132
8895,ELAINE,  Huuh! ,132
8896,JERRY, Oh my God!,132
8897,ELAINE," Oh, my God.",132
8898,JERRY, What is that smell?,132
8899,ELAINE, Uuh.,132
8900,ELAINE, Uhh,132

8902,JERRY," No, it's a nine-hundred S.  It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!",132
8903,ELAINE,  It's a tu-hur-bo.,132

8906,JERRY," Tony, y-you better bring that car back!",132
8907,JERRY," Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!",132
8908,JERRY, Tony.,132
8909,JERRY,  Where do I find these guys?,132
8910,KRAMER, Three quarters of a tank.,132
8911,KRAMER, That's better than we estimated.,132
8912,KRAMER," Ah, no, that's not in the budget.",132
8913,KRAMER," That's not a good investment, that's a loss.",132
8914,KRAMER," Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate.",132
8915,KRAMER," Yeah, those are New York plates.",132
8916,KRAMER," I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.",132
8917,KRAMER, I'm calling Jerry.,132
8918,KRAMER, Brought my phone.,132
8919,JERRY,  Y'hello.,132
8920,KRAMER," Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?",132

8924,KRAMER,"  Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.",132
8925,JERRY," Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.",132
8926,KRAMER, Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.,132
8927,JERRY," Good work Kramer, this is incredible.",132
8928,KRAMER," Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.",132
8929,ELAINE, Elaine Benes.,132
8930,JERRY," Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!",132
8931,ELAINE," Oh my god, where is it?",132
8932,JERRY," It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.",132
8933,ELAINE, Are the clubs there?,132
8934,JERRY, I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.,132
8935,ELAINE," Alright, I'm heading over right now.",132
8936,ELAINE, What's the status?,132
8937,JERRY," Last check-in, they were still on him.",132
8938,ELAINE," Well, have they called the police yet?",132
8939,JERRY," No, they won't call the police.",132
8940,ELAINE, What? Why not?,132
8941,JERRY, They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.,132
8942,ELAINE, Kramer has a record.,132
8943,JERRY, Not a Federal record.,132
8944,JERRY, What's going on?,132
8945,KRAMER," Yeah, nothing. We're still following him.",132

8948,KRAMER," Alright, alright, I'll follow him.",132
8949,KRAMER," Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.",132
8950,ELAINE, I need those clubs.,132
8951,JERRY," Kramer, I want my car.",132
8952,KRAMER," Well, I don't know what to do.",132

9545,GEORGE, All the way?,135
9546,JERRY," Not our ""all the way"", their ""all the way."" I got the stink of responsibility on me.",135
9547,GEORGE," Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.",135
9548,JERRY, You stink worse than I do!,135
9549,GEORGE," I'm feeling something else here, Jerry!",135
9550,ELAINE,"  Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?",135
9551,ELAINE," What? Well, who's gonna do it?",135
9552,ELAINE, Me? Why me?,135
9553,ELAINE," Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.",135
9554,ELAINE, Burma?,135
9555,ELAINE, Mr. Peterman?,135
9556,JERRY, Where?,135
9557,ELAINE, Burma.,135
9558,JERRY, Isn't it Myanmar now?,135
9559,ELAINE," Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!",135
9560,JERRY," No, certainly not.",135
9561,ELAINE," I mean, I can't give people orders!",135
9562,JERRY, No one's gonna listen to you.,135
9563,ELAINE, I am not qualified to run the catalog!,135
9564,JERRY, You're not qualified to work at the catalog.,135
9565,KRAMER, Hey.  What's wrong?,135
9566,ELAINE," Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.",135
9567,KRAMER, Where?,135
9568,JERRY, Myanmar.,135
9569,KRAMER, The discount pharmacy?,135
9570,ELAINE," Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.",135
9571,KRAMER," Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult?  What, you don't have enough experience?  Oh, you're not smart enough?  Where's your confidence?  Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...",135
9572,ELAINE, Karate?,135
9573,KRAMER," Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.",135
9574,ELAINE, Katra?,135
9575,KRAMER," Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, ""Yes, I can!""",135
9576,JERRY, Sammy Davis had it.,135
9577,KRAMER, So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.,135
9578,ELAINE," Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.",135
9579,KRAMER, Sure you have.,135
9580,ELAINE," I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.",135
9581,KRAMER," You follow your katra, and you can do anything.  Now get out of here.",135
9582,ELAINE,  Okay.,135
9583,KRAMER, That kid is gonna be all right.,135
9584,JERRY," No, she's not.",135
9585,KRAMER, Hey there.,135
9586,KRAMER," Okay, Joey.",135
9587,JERRY, You guys both have class at the same time?,135
9588,KRAMER," No, we're in the same class.",135
9589,JERRY, What do you mean you're in the same class?,135
9590,KRAMER, He almost beat me.,135
9591,JERRY," Kramer, you're fighting children?!",135
9592,KRAMER," We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.",135
9593,JERRY," He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!",135
9594,KRAMER, I got carpool. ,135
9595,KRAMER," Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.",135
9596,ELAINE, You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 6,135
9597,GEORGE, It's open!,135
9598,GEORGE,  Rosses.,135
9599,GEORGE," Well, uh... come in, come, come in. ",135
9600,GEORGE," Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? ",135
9601,GEORGE," Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.",135
9602,GEORGE," Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.",135
9603,GEORGE," Oh, that's wonderful.",135
9604,GEORGE," Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?",135
9605,GEORGE,"  Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...",135
9606,GEORGE, I can't believe this is happening.,135
9607,GEORGE,  The second I see him.,135
9608,JERRY, Hey.,135
9609,GEORGE," Hey. How's your day, good?",135
9610,JERRY," Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.",135
9611,GEORGE," So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?",135
9612,JERRY, Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?,135
9613,GEORGE, What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?,135
9614,JERRY," No, no, no, it's... ""She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.""",135
9615,GEORGE, That's it. That's the line...  ...that destroyed my life.,135
9616,JERRY,  Problem?,135
9617,GEORGE," The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.",135
9618,JERRY," Hey, board of directors. Look at you!",135
9619,GEORGE," Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!",135
9620,JERRY," Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.",135
9621,GEORGE, Don't you see? I'm back in.,135
9622,JERRY, All because of Wrath of Khan?,135
9623,GEORGE, Yes!,135
9624,JERRY," Well, it was the best of those movies.",135
9625,GEORGE, KHAN!,135
9626,GEORGE,  Oh!,135
9627,GEORGE, Wink.,135
9628,GEORGE, Wyck.,135
9629,GEORGE, Oh. I know they have some monies.,135
9630,GEORGE," So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--",135
9631,GEORGE, And now?,135
9632,GEORGE, This townhouse?,135
9633,GEORGE, And now?,135
9634,GEORGE, Not.,135
9635,GEORGE," You know, it really can't.",135
9636,JERRY," Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.",135
9637,JERRY, I am. It was the world's first.,135
9638,JERRY," Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely...  Mulva!",135
9639,JERRY,  Hello?,135
9640,JERRY," Oh, I don't believe this.",135
9641,ELAINE,  Jerry!,135
9642,JERRY, Hey!,135
9643,ELAINE, Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.,135
9644,JERRY, How's it look?,135
9645,ELAINE,  It's a peach.,135
9646,JERRY, Huh?,135
9647,ELAINE," I say, it's a peach.",135
9648,JERRY," Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?",135
9649,ELAINE," No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.",135
9650,JERRY, I gotta do some research here.,135
9651,ELAINE," Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.",135
9652,JERRY," Oh, I'm the doofus?",135
9653,ELAINE," Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.",135
9654,JERRY," You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.",135
9655,ELAINE," Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.",135
9656,JERRY," Yeah, that's what I was thinking.",135
9657,ELAINE, Kramer!,135
9658,KRAMER," Oh, hey.",135
9659,ELAINE, What are you doing?,135
9660,KRAMER," Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating.",135
9661,ELAINE, You never said you were fighting children.,135
9662,KRAMER," Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.",135
9663,ELAINE, This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?,135
9664,KRAMER," No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.",135
9665,ELAINE, Search... for Spock?!,135
9666,KRAMER," Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...",135
9667,ELAINE,  You doofus!,135
9668,JERRY," Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.",135
9669,KRAMER, I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.,135
9670,KRAMER," What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?",135
9671,KRAMER, Aah! Aah! Mama!,135
9672,JERRY,"  Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.",135
9673,JERRY," Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. ",135
9674,JERRY, So... did you stop by the dojo?,135
9675,ELAINE, Yep.,135
9676,JERRY, How's your confidence level?,135
9677,ELAINE, Shot.,135
9678,JERRY, Self-esteem?,135
9679,ELAINE, Gone.,135
9680,JERRY, Doofus?,135
9681,ELAINE,  Yo.,135
9682,JERRY," All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?",135
9683,JERRY, What is that?,135
9684,ELAINE, It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.,135
9685,JERRY," Well, nobody sees the... cover.",135
9686,KRAMER, God!,135
9687,JERRY, What happened to you?,135
9688,KRAMER, Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh.  What is that?,135
9689,JERRY, It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.,135
9690,KRAMER, Oh I see.  Woof!,135
9691,ELAINE,  You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!,135
9692,KRAMER," Well, then I was way off!",135
9693,ELAINE," Well, I'll see ya... ",135
9694,JERRY, Vaya con dios.,135
9695,KRAMER,"  Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?",135
9696,JERRY," No, he's still stuck at the foundation.",135
9697,KRAMER," You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.",135
9698,JERRY, Widower? Wait a second. ,135
9699,GEORGE, Would I have had access to that?,135
9700,GEORGE, And now?,135
9701,GEORGE,  Not.,135
9702,GEORGE, Hello?,135
9703,JERRY," Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.",135
9704,GEORGE, My story?,135
9705,JERRY," Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof.  When are you getting out of there?",135
9706,GEORGE," Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?",135
9707,GEORGE,  I can't go.,135
9708,JERRY," What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!",135
9709,GEORGE, You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!,136
9710,GEORGE," I like, uh...",136
9711,GEORGE, ,136
9712,JERRY, He cleared his throat?,136
9713,GEORGE, Yes!,136
9714,JERRY, So?,136
9715,GEORGE," He did it right as he said ""her unfortunate accident.""",136
9716,JERRY, Not getting it.,136
9717,GEORGE," Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!",136
9718,JERRY," Oh, help me, Rhonda.",136
9719,GEORGE, What time is it?,136
9720,GEORGE, Right now?,136
9721,JERRY, I gotta go meet Pam.,136
9722,GEORGE," Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?",136
9723,JERRY, Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.,136
9724,GEORGE, Where's Elaine?,136
9725,JERRY," She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?",136
9726,GEORGE, What's with all these people having babies?,136
9727,JERRY, Perpetuation of the species.,136
9728,GEORGE, Yeah! Right!,136
9729,JERRY," By the way, just for the record -",136
9730,GEORGE," No, I did not! ",136
9731,ELAINE," Well, that's...that's sweet.",136
9732,ELAINE," Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...",136
9733,ELAINE, I really like the city.,136
9734,ELAINE," Uh, it was in the Hamptons.",136
9735,ELAINE," No, no, that's okay, it's uh...",136
9736,JERRY," So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...",136
9737,GEORGE, Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?,136
9738,JERRY," You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?",136
9739,GEORGE, Jerry Lewis?,136
9740,JERRY," I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.",136
9741,GEORGE, That's pretty paranoid.,136
9742,JERRY," Yes, it is.",136
9743,GEORGE, I like it!,136
9744,JERRY, I thought you might.,136
9745,JERRY," Hi, sorry I'm late.",136
9746,JERRY," You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.",136
9747,KRAMER," I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.",136
9748,KRAMER," Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.",136
9749,KRAMER, She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.,136
9750,KRAMER, I can't even speak in front of her. ,136
9751,KRAMER, She has delicate beauty.,136
9752,KRAMER," And yet, he's my friend.",136
9753,KRAMER," Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.",136
9754,KRAMER, I thought we were talking about me.,136
9755,KRAMER, Confront Jerry? I can't.,136
9756,KRAMER, I won't!,136
9757,GEORGE, Where are all the poetry magazines?,136
9758,ELAINE, The New Yorker has poetry.,136
9759,GEORGE, Yes. The New Yorker.,136
9760,JERRY, Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?,136
9761,ELAINE," They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.",136
9762,JERRY," C'mon, you want to have a baby.",136
9763,ELAINE, Why? Because I can?,136
9764,JERRY," It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?",136
9765,ELAINE, Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!,136
9766,ELAINE," Oh, I'm sorry.",136
9767,ELAINE," Yeah, like you must procreate.",136
9768,ELAINE," Oh, it's been done to death. ",136
9769,GEORGE," I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.",136
9770,GEORGE," No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad.  Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. ",136
9771,ELAINE," So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?",136
9772,ELAINE," 'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian.  You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot.  Right? Am I right?  Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin.  Oh, you got a little, uh...",136
9773,ELAINE, Oh. Are you alright?,136
9774,KRAMER," Yeah, I'll be okay.",136
9775,ELAINE," You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.",136
9776,KRAMER," Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.",136
9777,ELAINE," Oh, no...that won't last.",136
9778,KRAMER, What do you mean?,136
9779,ELAINE, He's not ga-ga.,136
9780,GEORGE," Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah!  Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.",136
9781,JERRY, How long did you leave it up there?,136
9782,GEORGE, Five minutes. What the hell happened here?,136
9783,JERRY," Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.",136
9784,GEORGE," I have to rewind it first.  Alright, alright.",136
9785,JERRY, Is that it?,136
9786,GEORGE, Stopped dead.,136
9787,JERRY, What do you make of it?,136
9788,GEORGE, I don't know. ,136
9789,KRAMER," Jerry. Uh, can we talk?",136
9790,KRAMER, I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.,136
9791,GEORGE, Why can't I stay?,136
9792,KRAMER, Because it doesn't concern you.,136
9793,GEORGE," Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. ",136
9794,JERRY," So, what's on your mind?",136
9795,KRAMER, It's Pam.,136
9796,JERRY, Pam? What about Pam?,136
9797,KRAMER," I love her, Jerry!",136
9798,JERRY, You what?,136
9799,KRAMER, I love her!,136
9800,JERRY, Is that right?,136
9801,KRAMER," Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.",136
9802,JERRY, What does that mean?,136
9803,KRAMER," Oh, and that voice!",136
9804,JERRY, What about her name?,136
9805,KRAMER," Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name.  Pam. Pam. Pam!",136
9806,JERRY, She's got really nice hair.,136
9807,KRAMER," Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.",136
9808,JERRY, You've got really specific tastes.,136
9809,KRAMER," Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.",136
9810,JERRY, She's got nice calves.,136
9811,KRAMER," Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...",136
9812,JERRY," Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.",136
9813,KRAMER," No you can't, Jerry.",136
9814,JERRY, But I might.,136
9815,KRAMER," Oh, no you don't.",136
9816,JERRY, Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?,136
9817,KRAMER, What...?,136
9818,JERRY, I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!,136
9819,JERRY, Pam!,136
9820,KRAMER, Huh?,136
9821,JERRY, Pam!,136
9822,KRAMER, Huh-yah! ,136
9823,KRAMER, So now he wants her more than ever!,136
9824,KRAMER," What am I gonna do, huh?",136
9825,KRAMER," What, again with you?",136
9826,KRAMER, If only I could say things like that around her.,136
9827,ELAINE," Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...",136
9828,GEORGE," Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!",136
9829,ELAINE, ...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.',136
9830,GEORGE," It's baffling, isn't it?",136
9831,ELAINE," Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?",136
9832,GEORGE," They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. ",136
9833,JERRY, That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!,136
9834,ELAINE, Ga-ga? When did that happen?,136
9835,JERRY, Yesterday. Six-ish.,136
9836,ELAINE," Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.",136
9837,JERRY, You just met the guy yesterday.,136
9838,ELAINE," Yeah, but we have a common goal.",136
9839,JERRY," A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?",136
9840,GEORGE, And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.,136
9841,ELAINE," Yeah, of course.",136
9842,JERRY," Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.",136
9843,ELAINE," Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.",136
9844,GEORGE," Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, ""Pardon my French.""",136
9845,JERRY, I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.,136

9849,KRAMER, Do I smell?,136
9850,KRAMER," Uh, Pantene.",136
9851,KRAMER, Newman! ,136
9852,KRAMER," Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.",136
9853,KRAMER, Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...,136
9854,KRAMER, ...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.,136
9855,KRAMER, It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.,136
9856,KRAMER, Newman. ,136
9857,ELAINE," Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.",136
9858,ELAINE," Although, I have a hunch you mean it.",136
9859,JERRY," I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.",136
9860,JERRY, Kramer!,136

9862,JERRY, Wait a minute! ,136
9863,JERRY," Alright, Newman! This is it! ",136
9864,JERRY, Why not?,136
9865,JERRY, I can't believe I'm losing Pam!,136
9866,JERRY, I thought we were talking about me.,136
9867,JERRY," Anyway, I don't need your help. ",136
9868,JERRY," Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?",136
9869,JERRY," C'mon, out with it.",136
9870,JERRY, Elaine? What does she have to -  Oh no...,136
9871,ELAINE," I know, I don't want......kids.",136
9872,ELAINE," Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.",136
9873,ELAINE, What?,136
9874,ELAINE, Really?,136
9875,ELAINE," You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...",136
9876,ELAINE, Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.,136
9877,ELAINE, Yeah!,136
9878,GEORGE, This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.,136
9879,JERRY, When did you build this thing?,136
9880,GEORGE," Yesterday, took the day off.  Now, from the time I left the room...",136
9881,GEORGE, Yeah.,136
9882,JERRY, And?,136
9883,GEORGE, Okay. That's what we know.,136
9884,JERRY, But we already knew that.,136
9885,GEORGE," Well, yeah.",136
9886,JERRY, Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.,136
9887,GEORGE, I don't know if you're ready for it.,136
9888,JERRY, Please.,136
9889,GEORGE," I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -",136
9890,JERRY," Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this.  Yeah?",136
9891,JERRY," C'mon up.  Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'",136
9892,GEORGE," I'm not through here, Jerry.  I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. ",136
9893,JERRY, We were just playin.',136
9894,JERRY, Uh huh...,136
9895,KRAMER, I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!,136
9896,KRAMER, How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.,136
9897,JERRY, Why can't I be a soul mate?,136
9898,KRAMER," Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?",136
9899,GEORGE," There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.",136
9900,GEORGE," You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard.  That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out...""Dear God!"" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.",136
9901,GEORGE," Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.",136
9902,ELAINE, What are you guys doing here?,136
9903,JERRY, We're getting vasectomies.,136
9904,ELAINE, Why?,136
9905,ELAINE, What?,136
9906,ELAINE, I cut it.,136
9907,JERRY, It's a little short.,136
9908,ELAINE, Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.,136
9909,GEORGE, ...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.,136
9910,GEORGE," No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. ",136
9911,JERRY, All right. How 'bout this one,137
9912,GEORGE, Fine.,137
9913,JERRY," They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now",137
9914,GEORGE, I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.,137
9915,JERRY," But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!",137
9916,GEORGE," I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..",137
9917,JERRY,  At least it's show business..,137
9918,GEORGE," But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.",137
9919,JERRY, What if she's got no interest in you?,137
9920,GEORGE, W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.,137
9921,KRAMER," George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?",137
9922,GEORGE," Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!",137
9923,KRAMER,  Wha??,137
9924,JERRY,  He knows.,137
9925,GEORGE,"  on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine!  Ha ha!",137
9926,KRAMER,"  Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.",137
9927,GEORGE, You sure?,137
9928,JERRY,  He knows.,137
9929,GEORGE, Wow. Nice.,137
9930,JERRY, Why don't you try your engagement story?,137
9931,GEORGE,  Won't work.,137
9932,JERRY, Are you sure?,137
9933,GEORGE,  He knows.,137
9934,ELAINE," Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. ",137
9935,ELAINE," Well. I mean.  Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.",137
9936,KRAMER," You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. ",137
9937,KRAMER,"  Oh, yeah--yeah.. ",137
9938,ELAINE,"  Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.",137
9939,JERRY,"  I don't know, do you have a--",137
9940,JERRY, Not bad. Wuh--what does she--,137
9941,ELAINE,  I put her stats on the back.,137
9942,JERRY," Pretty impressive--""Serious boyfriend '92 to '95."" Owns her own car.. ""Favorite president",137
9943,GEORGE, Hnn! Let me see that.,137
9944,JERRY,"  So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?",137
9945,ELAINE,  You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.,137
9946,JERRY, Why would anybody want a friend.,137
9947,ELAINE,"  Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.",137
9948,JERRY, I mean all that stuff is so small.. ) stupid..,137
9949,GEORGE,"  You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancée..",137
9950,JERRY, What?,137
9951,GEORGE," Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!",137
9952,ELAINE,"  Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. ",137
9953,GEORGE,  Can I keep this?,137
9954,ELAINE," No, I need it.",137
9955,GEORGE,  Thanks.,137

9966,ELAINE,"   would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?",137
9967,JERRY, Would she have hooks?,137

10124,ELAINE," Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?",137
10125,ELAINE,  It's locked..,137
10126,JERRY," So this is it, huh?",137
10127,GEORGE," But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..",137
10128,JERRY,  I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?  Let's get out of here George.,137
10129,KRAMER, I wouldn't walk over there.,138
10130,JERRY, Why not?,138
10131,KRAMER," It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.",138
10132,JERRY, What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.,138
10133,KRAMER, I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.,138
10134,JERRY," No, cab's comin' in right here  Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.",138
10135,KRAMER," Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.",138
10136,JERRY," You were livin' in the village then, right?",138
10137,KRAMER, Don't really remember.													 ,138
10138,ELAINE,  Toxic waste green.,138
10139,JERRY, That is disgusting.,138
10140,ELAINE," You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.",138
10141,JERRY," Well, then you're drivin' me wild.",138
10142,ELAINE, I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.,138
10143,JERRY,"  Oh, why you havin' a party?  ",138
10144,ELAINE," I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.",138
10145,JERRY, Like with dogs.,138
10146,ELAINE, Exactly.,138
10147,GEORGE, Party?,138
10148,ELAINE, Yeah.,138
10149,GEORGE, Food?,138
10150,ELAINE, Uh huh.,138
10151,GEORGE, Bar?,138
10152,ELAINE, Yeah.,138
10153,GEORGE, George?,138
10154,JERRY, He's gonna show up anyway.,138
10155,ELAINE," George, I just don't want you interfering.",138
10156,GEORGE, How could I possibly interfere?,138
10157,JERRY, Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?,138
10158,GEORGE,"  Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic.  You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out?   She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?",138
10159,GEORGE," Hi ah, My name is George.",138
10160,GEORGE," No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.",138
10161,GEORGE, So...,138
10162,ELAINE," Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! ",138
10163,GEORGE, Sweet Fancy Moses!,138
10164,KRAMER, You get the tickets?,138
10165,JERRY, Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.,138
10166,KRAMER, Death Blow,138
10167,JERRY," Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?",138
10168,KRAMER," Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.",138
10169,JERRY, Yeah I guess I do owe you.,138
10170,KRAMER," Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?",138
10171,JERRY," No, I'm okay.",138
10172,KRAMER," There's no problem, really.",138
10173,JERRY, I'm fine.  How was the party?,138
10174,GEORGE, Food was good.,138
10175,JERRY," Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?",138
10176,GEORGE," Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment.  Have you ever seen Elaine dance?",138
10177,JERRY, Elaine danced?,138
10178,GEORGE, It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.,138
10179,JERRY, Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?,138
10180,GEORGE," What, you mean you know about this?",138
10181,JERRY, For some time...  It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.,138
10182,GEORGE," Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.",138
10183,JERRY, And by then you've lost interest.,138
10184,GEORGE," Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.",138
10185,JERRY, What made him get that thing?,138
10186,GEORGE, During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.,138
10187,JERRY, Not a very long trip. ,138
10188,KRAMER, Brody's in.,138
10189,JERRY, I don't even have the extra ticket yet.,138
10190,KRAMER," Well, you better get on the horn.",138
10191,ELAINE," I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. ",138
10192,JERRY, How could that be?,138
10193,ELAINE," Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?",138
10194,JERRY," No, George was there, he said he had a great time.",138
10195,ELAINE," Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.",138
10196,JERRY," Oh, what are you talkin' about?",138
10197,ELAINE," He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.",138
10198,JERRY, Now you're talkin' crazy!,138
10199,ELAINE," All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?",138
10200,JERRY,"  Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.													 ",138
10201,ELAINE," Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?",138
10202,ELAINE," Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?",138
10203,ELAINE," Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.",138
10204,ELAINE, Oh he's not. He's very harmful.,138
10205,ELAINE, Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.,138
10206,ELAINE," Yeah, we're good friends.",138
10207,GEORGE, So this Anna called me from out of the blue.,138
10208,JERRY, Really? I thought you were rebuffed.,138
10209,GEORGE, With extreme prejudice.,138
10210,JERRY, Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.,138
10211,GEORGE," No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.",138
10212,JERRY," Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.",138
10213,GEORGE, I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.,138
10214,JERRY," You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...",138
10215,GEORGE," Yes ... yes, yes",138
10216,JERRY," The bad fiancé&Mac226, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...",138
10217,GEORGE," Okay, the point is made.",138
10218,JERRY," The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen...  The bad tipper!",138
10219,JERRY, Half of show business is here.,138
10220,KRAMER, There's Brody. Brody! Over here.,138
10221,JERRY, That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.,138
10222,KRAMER," Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.",138
10223,JERRY, I'm a joke maker.,138
10224,KRAMER," All right, here we go, Death Blow. ",138
10225,JERRY,"  Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?",138
10226,KRAMER," Relax, he does that all the time.													 													JERRY",138
10227,KRAMER," He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?",138
10228,JERRY, May I see you outside for a moment please?,138
10229,KRAMER, But I want to--,138
10230,JERRY, Outside!,138
10231,ELAINE," Hey, have you seen Anna?",138
10232,ELAINE, To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?,138
10233,ELAINE," Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!",138
10234,JERRY, What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?,138
10235,KRAMER," Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.",138
10236,JERRY, It's not legitimate.,138
10237,KRAMER, It's a business.,138
10238,JERRY, Where did you meet this guy?,138
10239,KRAMER, He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--,138
10240,JERRY, Kramer. ,138
10241,KRAMER," Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!",138
10242,JERRY, I don't believe this. ,138
10243,GEORGE," No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?",138
10244,GEORGE," Yeah, she's a sweet ride.",138
10245,GEORGE, Maybe.,138
10246,GEORGE, Guess not.,138
10247,ELAINE,  Stay away from her.,138
10248,GEORGE, I didn't do nothin'.,138
10249,ELAINE,  Get in the car.,138
10250,ELAINE," You heard me young lady, get in the car.  And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.",138
10251,GEORGE, Lighten up.,138
10252,KRAMER," Go get 'em, Death Blow!  You okay?",138
10253,KRAMER," Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.",138
10254,JERRY," Hey, what is going on over there?",138
10255,JERRY, Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.,138
10256,KRAMER," Jerry, if the man is in pain...",138
10257,JERRY," Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.",138
10258,KRAMER," Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.",138
10259,JERRY," All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera.",138
10260,KRAMER,"  C'mon, let's go.",138
10261,JERRY, Oh man...,138
10262,KRAMER," Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?",138
10263,JERRY, How was the rest of Death Blow?,138
10264,KRAMER," Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!",138
10265,JERRY," Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!",138
10266,KRAMER," He's quite a character, isn't he?",138
10267,JERRY," You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!",138
10268,KRAMER, I got it. Yep.,138
10269,KRAMER, Come on up. It's Brody.,138
10270,JERRY," What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.",138
10271,KRAMER," Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.",138
10272,JERRY, What if I didn't do it right?,138
10273,KRAMER, It's your first time. He'll understand.,138
10274,JERRY, People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.,138
10275,KRAMER," Hey, Brody!",138
10276,JERRY, Hi.,138
10277,JERRY, Yeah.,138
10278,JERRY, What?,138
10279,JERRY," Well, I did the best I could.",138
10280,KRAMER, Uh yeah. It's under the couch.,138
10281,KRAMER, Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.,138
10282,JERRY, I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.,138
10283,KRAMER," But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.",138
10284,JERRY, We're talkin' federal crime here.,138
10285,KRAMER," Sure, do you need a glove?",138
10286,ELAINE, What? What is so funny?,138
10287,ELAINE, At Yankee Stadium?,138
10288,ELAINE," Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.",138
10289,ELAINE, Who did that? Who did that?!?,138
10290,KRAMER,"  The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. ",138
10291,JERRY," No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?",138
10292,KRAMER, That's fine.,138
10293,JERRY, Do you even know what this scene is about?,138
10294,KRAMER, It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.,138
10295,JERRY," No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.",138
10296,KRAMER, Wha? Where?,138
10297,JERRY, Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.,138
10298,KRAMER," Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.",138
10299,JERRY," I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.",138
10300,KRAMER, So you'll do the movie? ,138
10301,JERRY, I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?,138
10302,KRAMER, Right here. ,138
10303,ELAINE," Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing.  What?",138
10304,KRAMER,  This umpf thing.,138
10305,ELAINE, It's dancing.,138
10306,KRAMER," No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally.",138
10307,ELAINE, I dance fine.													 													KRAMER,138
10308,ELAINE," He doesn't know what he's talkin' about.  Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?",138
10309,JERRY, I forgot to make my bed. ,138
10310,ELAINE," Jerry, do I stink?",138
10311,JERRY," All right, you're beyond stink.",138
10312,ELAINE, But I really enjoy dancing.,138
10313,JERRY," And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.",138
10314,ELAINE, It's that bad?,138
10315,JERRY," Have you ever seen yourself?  Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.",138
10316,ELAINE," George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.",138
10317,GEORGE," Yo, Anna.",138
10318,GEORGE,  You don't wanna know.,138
10319,ELAINE," Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.",138
10320,GEORGE," What, wha, what're you talkin' about?",138
10321,ELAINE," Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.",138
10322,GEORGE," Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!",138
10323,ELAINE, I never should have given Anna the impression--,138
10324,GEORGE," Pick it up, pick it up!",138
10325,ELAINE," --that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.",138
10326,GEORGE," Elaine, get off the speaker! ",138
10327,ELAINE, What?,138
10328,GEORGE, You are ruinin' everything.,138
10329,ELAINE, I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?,138
10330,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.",138
10331,ELAINE," George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?",138
10332,ELAINE," No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.",138
10333,GEORGE, I'm a bad man!,138
10334,JERRY," No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.",138
10335,JERRY," You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.",138
10336,JERRY, Kramer...,138
10337,KRAMER," I know, Jerry. It's okay.  Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.",138
10338,JERRY," All right. That's it, I can't work like this.",138
10339,KRAMER, Jerry...,138
10340,JERRY, I'm off the project. ,138
10341,KRAMER, Jerry!,138
10342,KRAMER, Yeah.,138
10343,GEORGE," Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?",138
10344,JERRY, They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.,138
10345,GEORGE, Anna actually has respect for me now.  It's all over.,138
10346,JERRY," Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. ",138
10347,KRAMER," Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!",138
10348,JERRY," Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...",138
10349,GEORGE, Did you say dangerous?,138
10350,GEORGE, I'm a bootlegger.,138
10351,GEORGE," I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!",138
10352,GEORGE, I can do hard time for this one. And community service!,138
10353,GEORGE,  Get outta my way!,138
10354,KRAMER," Jerry, George got arrested.",138
10355,JERRY, What?,138
10356,KRAMER," Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him.",138
10357,JERRY, Oh now I see.  Yeah.,138
10358,JERRY, What're we gonna do?,138
10359,KRAMER," Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?",138
10360,JERRY, I think that's it.  Sweet fancy Moses!													 													KRAMER,138
10361,JERRY," Uh, well. It, uh...",138
10362,KRAMER," Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.",138
10363,KRAMER, Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.													 													JERRY,138
10364,KRAMER," Yeah, it's a disturbing image.",138
10365,JERRY," Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.",138
10366,GEORGE, Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? ,138
10367,ELAINE, Anna...,138
10368,ELAINE," All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. ",138
10369,GEORGE, Oh my God.,138
10370,GEORGE, Ow! Dad...,138
10371,ELAINE, All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.,138
10372,ELAINE, You got that right.,138
10373,ELAINE, That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.,138
10374,ELAINE, I could drop you like a bag of dirt.,138
10375,JERRY," But he's an old man, Elaine.",138
10376,ELAINE," Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.",138
10377,JERRY,"  Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.",138
10378,ELAINE," Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.",138
10379,JERRY, No you don't.,138
10380,JERRY, Yeah.,138
10381,JERRY, Thank you. ,138
10382,ELAINE, You were big.,138
10383,JERRY, I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?,138
10384,ELAINE," Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.",138
10385,JERRY, I wouldn't worry about it. ,138
10386,ELAINE, Difficult? ,139
10387,ELAINE," Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper. ",139
10388,ELAINE, But it was in pen. You fake erase. ,139
10389,ELAINE, What are you writing? Doctor. ,139
10390,GEORGE, Thanks. ,139
10391,GEORGE, Ohhhhhh ,139
10392,JERRY, No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver. ,139
10393,GEORGE, Smile ,139
10394,JERRY, What are you doing? ,139
10395,GEORGE," I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something ",139
10396,JERRY, Extra teeth. I love that look. ,139
10397,GEORGE," Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says "" I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."" ",139
10398,JERRY, What mustard stain? ,139
10399,GEORGE, Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures. ,139
10400,JERRY, Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain? ,139
10401,GEORGE, That's got nothing to do with it. ,139
10402,JERRY, I see. She's looking. ,139
10403,GEORGE, Yesssss. ,139
10404,KRAMER," Hey, you got to get this thing fixed. ",139
10405,JERRY, They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same. ,139
10406,KRAMER, Would you like a refund? ,139
10407,JERRY, Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago. ,139
10408,KRAMER, Would you be interested? ,139
10409,JERRY, Well how are you going..... ,139
10410,KRAMER, Would you? ,139
10411,JERRY, I guess I would. ,139
10412,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. ",139
10413,ELAINE, You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today. ,139
10414,JERRY, Not the gown again. ,139
10415,ELAINE," No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that? ",139
10416,JERRY, They have gotten to know you. ,139
10417,ELAINE, Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash. ,139
10418,GEORGE, Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult. ,139
10419,ELAINE, Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy. ,139
10420,JERRY, Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys. ,139
10421,ELAINE, Listen to me you little shi........ ,139
10422,GEORGE, Smile. ,139
10423,ELAINE, Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on. ,139
10424,ELAINE, Where did you get my chart? ,139
10425,ELAINE, You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just....... ,139
10426,ELAINE," Please, please. It's really, really itchy. ",139
10427,JERRY, Yeah. ,139
10428,JERRY, Who's it from? ,139
10429,JERRY, What if I don't want it? ,139
10430,JERRY, Maybe I am. ,139
10431,JERRY, I've never done it before. ,139
10432,JERRY, Why not? ,139
10433,GEORGE, Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package. ,139
10434,JERRY, I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from. ,139
10435,GEORGE, What do you think it's a bomb? ,139
10436,JERRY, It's not totally impossible. ,139
10437,GEORGE, Oh the ego on you. ,139
10438,JERRY, Why can't I be bombable? ,139
10439,GEORGE, Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes. ,139
10440,JERRY, I suppose you think your bombable. ,139
10441,GEORGE, Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way. ,139
10442,JERRY, There's more than a couple. ,139
10443,GEORGE, Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these. ,139
10444,JERRY, You don't have a Mercedes. ,139
10445,GEORGE, I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine. ,139
10446,JERRY, The driver seems a little put out. ,139
10447,GEORGE, No. He was fine with it. Check that out. ,139
10448,JERRY, Is that Burt Reynolds? ,139
10449,GEORGE, Wax Museum. ,139
10450,JERRY, Oh. ,139
10451,GEORGE, Oh. What is this? ,139
10452,JERRY, That's a lot of skin. ,139
10453,GEORGE, This must be Sheila from the photo place. ,139
10454,JERRY, You can barely see her face. ,139
10455,GEORGE, She must have slipped it in here. ,139
10456,KRAMER, I I I ,139
10457,GEORGE, Photo store Sheila. ,139
10458,KRAMER, Well hello Photo store Sheila. ,139
10459,GEORGE, All right. I will see you boys later. ,139
10460,JERRY, Where are you going? ,139
10461,GEORGE, To ask her out. ,139
10462,KRAMER," No, no. Your not playing the game. ",139
10463,GEORGE, What game? ,139
10464,KRAMER," She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is "" Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. "" ",139
10465,GEORGE, No good? ,139
10466,KRAMER," George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back. ",139
10467,GEORGE," Oh, I don't know. ",139
10468,KRAMER, Well as you know I've always been something of a photog. ,139
10469,JERRY, Oh yeah I like this idea. ,139
10470,ELAINE, And then he starts writing on my chart. ,139
10471,GEORGE, Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like. ,139
10472,ELAINE, You can't change your chart. It's your chart. ,139
10473,GEORGE, I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time. ,139
10474,ELAINE, You are!?! ,139
10475,GEORGE," Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone? ",139
10476,ELAINE, Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card. ,139
10477,GEORGE, Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work? ,139
10478,ELAINE, Actually I thought he was very professional. ,139
10479,GEORGE, So it was a good experience. ,139
10480,ELAINE, Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID. ,139
10481,GEORGE, Nice. ,139
10482,ELAINE, Yeah it is nice actually. ,139
10483,ELAINE, I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading. ,139
10484,ELAINE, Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious ,139
10485,ELAINE, Come on. Move.  Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh.... ,139
10486,ELAINE, Oh please no more. ,139
10487,JERRY, Hey ,139
10488,GEORGE, Where's Kramer? ,139
10489,JERRY, He went to get some steak sauce. Why? ,139
10490,GEORGE, Personal matter. ,139
10491,JERRY, Hello ,139
10492,JERRY, Hello Leo. You don't have to yell. ,139
10493,JERRY, How did you get my package? ,139
10494,JERRY, I don't know what you should do with it. ,139
10495,GEORGE, Tell him to open it. ,139
10496,JERRY, I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot. ,139
10497,JERRY, Open the package Leo. ,139
10498,JERRY, Opening. ,139
10499,ELAINE, So it wasn't a bomb. ,139
10500,JERRY," No, No bomb. ",139
10501,ELAINE, Well then what? ,139
10502,JERRY, Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up. ,139
10503,ELAINE, But he's okay? ,139
10504,JERRY," Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal. ",139
10505,ELAINE, Yeah I am still holding. ,139
10506,JERRY, Is this my stereo? ,139
10507,KRAMER, Hey you got it. ,139
10508,JERRY, What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up. ,139
10509,KRAMER, That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400. ,139
10510,JERRY, But you were supposed to get me a refund. ,139
10511,KRAMER, You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago. ,139
10512,JERRY, So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo? ,139
10513,KRAMER, It's just a write off for them. ,139
10514,JERRY, How is it a write off? ,139
10515,KRAMER, They just write it off. ,139
10516,JERRY, Write it off what? ,139
10517,KRAMER, Jerry all these big companies they write off everything ,139
10518,JERRY, You don't even know what a write off is. ,139
10519,KRAMER, Do you? ,139
10520,JERRY, No. I don't. ,139
10521,KRAMER, But they do and they are the ones writing it off. ,139
10522,JERRY, I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back. ,139
10523,ELAINE," What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello. ",139
10524,JERRY, Still no luck ,139
10525,ELAINE, Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet. ,139
10526,JERRY, There's no Zorn or Zoutraph. ,139
10527,ELAINE, There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .,139
10528,JERRY, Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .,139
10529,ELAINE, Dr. Resnick. He's not listed. ,139
10530,JERRY, He's not that good. ,139
10531,GEORGE, Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff. ,139
10532,KRAMER, Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her. ,139

10538,KRAMER, I don't know it's up to you. ,139
10539,GEORGE, Do you think it would be better if I did? ,139
10540,KRAMER, It might be. I mean whatever you want. ,139

10549,ELAINE, Oh uh uh... ,139
10550,ELAINE, Leo. Has the doctor been in yet? ,139
10551,ELAINE," Okay listen Leo. Your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay. ",139
10552,ELAINE, I should have never left him alone. ,139

10564,GEORGE, So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday. ,139
10565,GEORGE, And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy. ,139
10566,GEORGE, Shall we say an hour. ,139
10567,JERRY, Define rarely. ,139
10568,JERRY, Are we about throw here Newman? ,139
10569,JERRY, Actually I am quite comfortable. ,139
10570,JERRY, No. ,139
10571,JERRY, You can't prove anything. ,139
10572,JERRY, No in a matter of fact it isn't. ,139
10573,ELAINE, Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it. ,139

10580,KRAMER, I like what you've done with that. ,139
10581,KRAMER," Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy. ",139
10582,KRAMER, That's correct. ,139
10583,KRAMER, From The Hoffer-Mandale Clinic in Belgium. ,139
10584,KRAMER, The Netherlands? ,139
10585,ELAINE, Where's my chart? Did you get it? ,139
10586,KRAMER, No. ,139
10587,ELAINE, What? What happened? ,139
10588,KRAMER, I don't know. But now they got a chart on me. ,139
10589,GEORGE, Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues. ,139
10590,GEORGE, And maybe we could go out and do something. ,139
10591,GEORGE, Hi. ,139
10592,GEORGE, I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for. ,139
10593,JERRY, I'm clean and you know it. ,139
10594,JERRY, Where did you get that? ,139
10595,GEORGE, I think that's one of mine. ,139
10596,JERRY, I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation. ,139
10597,JERRY, Okay. ,139
10598,GEORGE, Can we go now? ,139
10599,JERRY, Oh my god!! ,139
10600,GEORGE, OH MY GOD!!! ,139
10601,JERRY, I have some questions of my own. ,139
10602,GEORGE, Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful. ,139
10603,JERRY, The timeless art of seduction. ,139
10604,GEORGE, SHEILA!!! ,139
10605,JERRY,"I've been watching women in the department stores. They're trying on clothes, and I've noticed that they do it differently from men. Women don't try on the clothes, they get behind the clothes, you see? They take a dress off the rack, and they hold it up against themself. They can tell something from this. They stick one leg way out 'cause they nedd to know, if some day I'm one-legged, and at a fourty-five degree angle, what am I gonna wear? You never see a man do that. You never see a guy take a suit off the rack, put his head in the neck, and go, ""What do you think about this suit? I think I'll get it. Yeah, it looks fine. Put some shoes by the bottom of the pants, I wanna make sure. Yeah, perfect. And what if I'm walking? Move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes.",14
10606,JERRY," What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?",14
10607,ELAINE," Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?",14
10608,JERRY, He was good in Man From Uncle.,14
10609,ELAINE, Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?,14
10610,JERRY," I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.",14
10611,ELAINE," Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious.  Hey, look at naked people.",14
10612,JERRY," No, I don't wanna see the naked people.",14
10613,ELAINE, Been a while?,14
10614,JERRY," I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.",14
10615,ELAINE, I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.,14
10616,JERRY," I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. ",14
10617,ELAINE, What?,14
10618,JERRY, What?,14
10619,ELAINE, What was that look?,14
10620,JERRY, What look?,14
10621,ELAINE, The look you just gave me.,14
10622,JERRY, I gave a look?,14
10623,ELAINE, Yes.,14
10624,JERRY, What kind of look?,14
10625,ELAINE, I know that look.,14
10626,JERRY, Then what was it?,14
10627,ELAINE, Why should I tell you?,14
10628,JERRY," Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.",14
10629,ELAINE, Trust me. I know the look.  So...,14
10630,JERRY, What?,14
10631,ELAINE, What about the look?,14
10632,JERRY, I don't know.,14
10633,ELAINE, You got something on your mind?,14
10634,JERRY, No. Things pop into your head. You?,14
10635,ELAINE, Things occur to me from time to time.,14
10636,JERRY," Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.",14
10637,ELAINE," No, of course not.",14
10638,JERRY," I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?",14
10639,ELAINE, Thirty-seven.,14
10640,JERRY," Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. ",14
10641,ELAINE, We know the terrain.,14
10642,JERRY, No big surprises.,14
10643,ELAINE, Nope.,14
10644,JERRY, What do you think?,14
10645,ELAINE, I don't know. What do you think?,14
10646,JERRY," Well, it's something to consider.",14
10647,ELAINE, Yeah.,14
10648,JERRY," I mean, let's say we did.",14
10649,ELAINE, What if.,14
10650,JERRY, Is that like the end of the world or something?,14
10651,ELAINE, Certainly not.,14
10652,JERRY, Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?,14
10653,ELAINE, I know.,14
10654,JERRY," I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there.  We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.",14
10655,ELAINE, It's almost stupid if we didn't.,14
10656,JERRY, It's moronic.,14
10657,ELAINE, Absurd!,14
10658,JERRY," Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.",14
10659,ELAINE," We, there are always a few.",14
10660,JERRY," I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.",14
10661,ELAINE, Devastating.,14
10662,JERRY, Because this is very good. ,14
10663,ELAINE, And that would be good. ,14
10664,JERRY, That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.,14
10665,ELAINE," Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.",14
10666,JERRY," But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.",14
10667,ELAINE, Huh.,14
10668,JERRY," For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.",14
10669,ELAINE, Right.,14
10670,JERRY," But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.",14
10671,ELAINE," Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.",14
10672,JERRY, Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.,14
10673,ELAINE," All right, sir.",14
10674,JERRY, Now here's another little rule.,14
10675,ELAINE, Yeah.,14
10676,JERRY," When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.",14
10677,ELAINE," Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!",14
10678,JERRY, Well now we're gettin' somewhere.,14
10679,ELAINE, What about the kiss goodnight?,14
10680,JERRY, Tough one. You're call.,14
10681,ELAINE, It's brug-wa .,14
10682,JERRY, Fine. Well.,14
10683,ELAINE, Well.,14
10684,JERRY, You ready?,14
10685,ELAINE, Ready.,14
10686,JERRY, So think you can handle this?,14
10687,ELAINE, Definitely. ,14
10688,KRAMER, Hey.,14
10689,JERRY, Hey.,14
10690,KRAMER, Got the paper?,14
10691,JERRY, Not yet.,14
10692,KRAMER, No paper?,14
10693,JERRY, I haven't been out yet.,14
10694,KRAMER," Well, what's taking you so long?  Uh? Oh, well, yeah... ",14
10695,GEORGE," What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?",14
10696,JERRY," No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?",14
10697,GEORGE, Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?,14
10698,JERRY, Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.,14
10699,GEORGE, Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.,14
10700,JERRY, I thought you'd like that.,14
10701,GEORGE," Oh, this is huge!",14
10702,JERRY, I know.,14
10703,GEORGE," All right, okay. Let's go, details.",14
10704,JERRY," No, I can't do details.",14
10705,GEORGE, You wha?,14
10706,JERRY, I can't give details.,14
10707,GEORGE, No details?,14
10708,JERRY, I'm not in the mood.,14
10709,GEORGE," You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!",14
10710,JERRY," All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.",14
10711,GEORGE, Where are you sitting?,14
10712,JERRY, On the couch.,14
10713,GEORGE, Next to each other?,14
10714,JERRY," No, separated.",14
10715,GEORGE, Time?,14
10716,JERRY, Around eleven.,14
10717,GEORGE," Okay, go ahead.",14
10718,JERRY," So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.",14
10719,GEORGE," Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.",14
10720,JERRY," And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.",14
10721,GEORGE," Boy, these are really bad details.",14
10722,JERRY," It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.",14
10723,GEORGE, Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.,14
10724,JERRY, Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.,14
10725,GEORGE, Better than before?,14
10726,JERRY, She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.,14
10727,GEORGE, This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?,14
10728,JERRY, Not exactly.,14
10729,GEORGE, Not exactly. What does that mean?,14
10730,JERRY," Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. ",14
10731,GEORGE, Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.													 Thousands of years people have been trying to have their cake and eat it too. So all of a sudden the two of you are going to come along and do it. Where do you get the ego? No one can do it. It can't be done.,14
10732,JERRY, I think we've worked out a system.,14
10733,GEORGE," Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.",14
10734,JERRY," No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.",14
10735,GEORGE," Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.",14
10736,JERRY, Okay. No calls the next day.,14
10737,GEORGE,"  So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good.  Go ahead.",14
10738,JERRY, You ready for the second one?,14
10739,GEORGE," I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.",14
10740,JERRY, Spending the night. Optional.,14
10741,GEORGE," No, you see? You got greedy.",14
10742,JERRY," No, that's the rule. It's optional.",14
10743,GEORGE," I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide  You're not going anywhere.",14
10744,JERRY, I think you're wrong.,14
10745,GEORGE, I hope I am.,14
10746,JERRY, Is this yours or the roommate's?,14
10747,ELAINE, The roommate's.,14
10748,JERRY, Would she mind?,14
10749,ELAINE, She keeps track of everything.,14
10750,JERRY," Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.",14
10751,ELAINE, Thanks.,14
10752,JERRY," Well, guess I'll get going.",14
10753,ELAINE, Oh.,14
10754,JERRY," Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.",14
10755,ELAINE," Fine, go away.",14
10756,JERRY, I don't understand. Is there a problem?  I'm getting the impression there's a problem.,14
10757,ELAINE, Just go.,14
10758,JERRY, I'm having surgery tomorrow.,14
10759,ELAINE," Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.",14
10760,JERRY," But you said, it can be very serious.",14
10761,ELAINE," Okay, so fine. Go.",14
10762,JERRY, What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.,14
10763,ELAINE," Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.",14
10764,JERRY, It has nothing to do with whose house it is.,14
10765,ELAINE," Oh, of course it does. ",14
10766,JERRY, Hi.,14
10767,ELAINE, Oh really?,14
10768,ELAINE," Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?",14
10769,ELAINE, What are you doing?,14
10770,JERRY, I can't go if you're mad.,14
10771,ELAINE, I'm not mad.,14
10772,JERRY, You seemed a little mad.,14
10773,ELAINE," No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.",14
10774,JERRY, So you're okay with everything?,14
10775,ELAINE, Definitely. Are you?,14
10776,JERRY," Definitely. Well, goodnight.",14
10777,ELAINE, Goodn--  What're you doing?,14
10778,JERRY, What?,14
10779,ELAINE, Rules.,14
10780,GEORGE, What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.,14
10781,JERRY," No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.",14
10782,GEORGE, Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.,14
10783,JERRY," No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.",14
10784,GEORGE," What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?",14
10785,JERRY," You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.",14
10786,GEORGE, What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.,14
10787,JERRY, I think I heard her say something about a bench.,14
10788,GEORGE, A bench? What kind of a bench?,14
10789,JERRY," I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.",14
10790,GEORGE," What, like at a bus stop?",14
10791,JERRY, I don't know.,14
10792,GEORGE, Like a park bench?,14
10793,JERRY, I have no idea.,14
10794,GEORGE, Who puts a bench in their house?,14
10795,JERRY, Forget the bench.,14
10796,GEORGE, I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?,14
10797,JERRY," No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.",14
10798,GEORGE," Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.",14
10799,JERRY, Nice looking fellow.,14
10800,GEORGE, What about candle holders?,14
10801,JERRY, Too romantic.,14
10802,GEORGE, Lingerie?,14
10803,JERRY, Too sexual.,14
10804,GEORGE, Waffle maker.,14
10805,JERRY, Too domestic.,14
10806,GEORGE, Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.,14
10807,JERRY, Too Gubernatorial. ,14
10808,GEORGE, Let's work on the card.,14
10809,JERRY, Maybe you won't like it.,14
10810,ELAINE," Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.",14
10811,JERRY, You could not like it.,14
10812,ELAINE, Just the fact that you remembered means everything.,14
10813,JERRY," Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. ",14
10814,ELAINE, Cash?,14
10815,JERRY, Would do you think?,14
10816,ELAINE, You got me cash?,14
10817,JERRY, Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?,14
10818,ELAINE," Who are you, my uncle?",14
10819,JERRY, Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.,14
10820,ELAINE," Let me see the card.  To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? ",14
10821,KRAMER," Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. ",14
10822,ELAINE, Pal? You think I'm your pal?,14
10823,JERRY," I said, ""and more.""",14
10824,ELAINE, I am not your pal.,14
10825,JERRY, What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? ,14
10826,ELAINE," Oh, what is this? You got me something?",14
10827,KRAMER, Yeah. Open it.,14
10828,ELAINE, Oh Kramer...  The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! ,14
10829,KRAMER," That's pretty good, huh?",14
10830,JERRY, Great.,14
10831,KRAMER, Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.,14
10832,JERRY, Well goody for you.,14
10833,KRAMER," Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?",14
10834,JERRY, 182 bucks.,14
10835,KRAMER, Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.,14
10836,ELAINE,  Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.,14
10837,KRAMER,  Yates.,14
10838,ELAINE, Oh Kramer. ,14
10839,JERRY, Could you excuse us please?,14
10840,KRAMER, What?,14
10841,JERRY, We're talking.,14
10842,KRAMER," Oh, the relationship. ",14
10843,JERRY," You know, we never had one fight before this deal.",14
10844,ELAINE, I know.,14
10845,JERRY, Never.,14
10846,ELAINE, Ever.,14
10847,JERRY, We got along beautifully.,14
10848,ELAINE, Like clams.,14
10849,JERRY, It was wonderful.,14
10850,ELAINE, A pleasure.,14
10851,JERRY," So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.",14
10852,ELAINE, I can't do it.,14
10853,JERRY, You what?,14
10854,ELAINE, I can't do that.,14
10855,JERRY," You mean it's...  No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?",14
10856,ELAINE," This, that, and the other.",14
10857,JERRY," Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?",14
10858,ELAINE, You.,14
10859,JERRY,  Well...,14
10860,GEORGE," Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.",14
10861,JERRY, I never should have made up those rules.,14
10862,GEORGE, What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?,14
10863,JERRY, It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.,14
10864,GEORGE, You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.,14
10865,JERRY, Why?,14
10866,GEORGE," It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.",14
10867,JERRY, What did you end up giving her?,14
10868,GEORGE, 91 dollars.,14
10869,JERRY, Sorry about that.,14
10870,GEORGE, So what're you gonna do?,14
10871,JERRY," Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.",14
10872,GEORGE," So, maybe this should be it.",14
10873,JERRY, Could be it.,14
10874,GEORGE, She seems like an it.,14
10875,JERRY," She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...",14
10876,GEORGE, We'd have to kill him.,14
10877,JERRY," We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.",14
10878,GEORGE, I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.,14
10879,JERRY," Plus, you know what else.",14
10880,GEORGE, You better call her.,14
10881,KRAMER, Hey.,14
10882,JERRY, Hey.,14
10883,KRAMER, You got the paper yet?,14
10884,JERRY, Yeah.,14
10885,KRAMER," Well where is it?  Hey, you done with that?",14
10886,ELAINE, No.,14
10887,KRAMER," Well, you're not reading it now.",14
10888,ELAINE," All right, you can take it. But I want it back.",14
10889,KRAMER," Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?",14
10890,ELAINE," Ah, this. And that.",14
10891,JERRY, And the other.,14
10892,KRAMER," Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. ",14
10893,JERRY, My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.,140
10894,JERRY, Mentor? You mean your boss.,140
10895,JERRY, Hmm. So Cynthia's your mentor.,140
10896,JERRY," Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.",140
10897,GEORGE, I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?,140
10898,JERRY, Yes. And the mentor advises the protégé.,140
10899,GEORGE, Is there any money involved?,140
10900,JERRY, No.,140
10901,GEORGE, So what's in it for the mentor?,140
10902,JERRY," Respect, admiration, prestige.",140
10903,GEORGE, Pssh. Would the protégé pick up stuff for the mentor?,140
10904,JERRY," I suppose if it was on the protégé's way to the mentor, they might.",140
10905,GEORGE, Laundry? Dry cleaning?,140
10906,JERRY," It's not a valet, it's a protégé.",140
10907,GEORGE," Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.",140
10908,JERRY,  Risk management?,140
10909,GEORGE, Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.,140
10910,JERRY, Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?,140
10911,GEORGE, I guess it's on my resume.,140
10912,JERRY, Hello?,140
10913,GEORGE," You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice.",140
10914,JERRY, So get this book on tape.,140
10915,GEORGE," You can't, it's a textbook.",140
10916,ELAINE," Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?",140
10917,JERRY, Am I going? It was three nights ago.,140
10918,ELAINE," What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.",140
10919,JERRY," Oh, it was a lovely affair.",140
10920,ELAINE," Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time.  Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?",140
10921,ELAINE," Alright, send him up here.",140
10922,JERRY, You gonna do a little yelling?,140
10923,ELAINE, I'm gonna do a little firing.,140
10924,JERRY," That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?",140
10925,ELAINE," Oh yeah, sure.  Gimme a break.",140
10926,JERRY," Hey, Copernicus?",140
10927,ELAINE," Oh, great. Send him in.",140
10928,ELAINE," Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you.",140
10929,JERRY," So, what did you say?",140
10930,ELAINE," Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.",140
10931,JERRY, What? What did you--,140
10932,ELAINE, Copywriter.,140
10933,JERRY, He's writing copy?,140
10934,ELAINE, Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.,140
10935,KRAMER, Yowza yowza. Check it out.,140
10936,JERRY,  Jewish singles night?,140
10937,KRAMER, I expect you both to be there.,140
10938,ELAINE, I'm not Jewish.,140
10939,KRAMER, Well neither am I.,140
10940,JERRY, Well why are you going?,140
10941,KRAMER," I'm not, I'm running it.",140
10942,JERRY, What are you talking about?,140
10943,KRAMER," Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.",140
10944,JERRY, Lomez is Jewish?,140
10945,KRAMER," Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.",140
10946,ELAINE,  At the Knights of Columbus?,140
10947,KRAMER," Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.",140
10948,JERRY," Kramer, you know, I--",140
10949,KRAMER," No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.",140
10950,ELAINE,  A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.,140
10951,KRAMER, Do you like tsimmis?,140
10952,JERRY," I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.",140
10953,JERRY, Hello.,140
10954,JERRY, No kidding?,140
10955,JERRY, Bania?,140
10956,GEORGE," Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?",140
10957,GEORGE," I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.",140
10958,JERRY, Reading for the Blind?,140
10959,GEORGE," I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.",140
10960,JERRY," So, I finally met the mentor.",140
10961,GEORGE, What's she like? Impressive?,140
10962,JERRY," Oh yeah, she's dating Bania.",140
10963,GEORGE, Bania?,140
10964,JERRY, Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.,140
10965,GEORGE, What did you have?,140
10966,JERRY," Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?",140
10967,GEORGE, Marsala?,140
10968,JERRY," Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.",140
10969,JERRY," Hey, good luck with that.",140
10970,GEORGE, Thank you.,140
10971,GEORGE, Dad.,140
10972,GEORGE, What are you doing here?,140
10973,KRAMER," Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.",140
10974,JERRY," Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?",140
10975,KRAMER," Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?",140
10976,KRAMER, What's the matter with him?,140
10977,GEORGE," My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.",140
10978,KRAMER, Shell-shocked?,140
10979,GEORGE," Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.",140
10980,ELAINE," That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.",140
10981,ELAINE," Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day.",140
10982,ELAINE," Oh, okay.",140
10983,ELAINE, What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.,140
10984,JERRY," Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.",140
10985,ELAINE," You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.",140
10986,GEORGE, Nothing at all.,140
10987,GEORGE," You're a very handsome man, by the way.",140
10988,JERRY, What the hell is going on here?,140
10989,JERRY, What are you doing?,140
10990,KRAMER," I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.",140
10991,JERRY," No, I don't want to.",140
10992,KRAMER," Eat, eat! You're skin and bones.",140
10993,KRAMER, Hah?,140
10994,JERRY," Oh, this is awful.",140
10995,KRAMER," Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.",140
10996,JERRY, Did you follow the recipe?,140
10997,KRAMER, The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.,140
10998,JERRY, It tastes like dirt.,140
10999,KRAMER," Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.",140
11000,JERRY," Kramer, you can't talk to Frank.",140
11001,KRAMER," No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.",140
11002,KRAMER, My stuffed cabbage!,140
11003,JERRY," Yeah, it was alright.",140
11004,JERRY," No. No, no way, no Bania.",140
11005,JERRY," Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.",140
11006,JERRY, Would. Does. Is.,140
11007,ELAINE," Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.",140
11008,ELAINE," He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.",140
11009,ELAINE," Well, no, I would hardly--",140
11010,ELAINE, Relax--,140
11011,ELAINE," Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!",140
11012,GEORGE, This guy sounds just like me.,140
11013,GEORGE, This is horrible.,140
11014,GEORGE,  Stop it! Stop it!,140
11015,KRAMER," C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.",140
11016,KRAMER," Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?",140
11017,KRAMER, What happened?,140
11018,KRAMER," Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.",140
11019,KRAMER," Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.",140
11020,JERRY, So you saw Bania's act?,140
11021,JERRY," I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.",140
11022,JERRY, He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.,140
11023,JERRY, No more mentor?,140
11024,JERRY, Well at least you and I are okay again.,140
11025,JERRY, Why?,140
11026,JERRY, I can tell you what to do.,140
11027,JERRY, I can tell you what to think.,140
11028,JERRY, Oh.,140
11029,GEORGE," I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.",140
11030,JERRY," Kind of in the middle of something here, George.",140
11031,JERRY, George?,140
11032,JERRY, I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.,140
11033,JERRY," Yeah, see ya.",140
11034,JERRY, What's your problem.,140
11035,GEORGE, No problem.,140
11036,ELAINE, Oh.,140
11037,ELAINE," You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.",140
11038,GEORGE," I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.",140
11039,GEORGE," I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.",140
11040,GEORGE, Okay.,140
11041,JERRY," Oh, hey Bania.",140
11042,JERRY," Oh, that's too bad.",140
11043,JERRY," Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestlé's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--",140
11044,KRAMER, Hey.,140
11045,KRAMER," Oh yeah, come on in, Frank.",140
11046,KRAMER, Keflon.,140
11047,ELAINE," Let's just replace ""hail of shrapnel"" and ""scar tissue"" with ""string of pearls"" and ""raspberry scones"".",140
11048,JERRY, George Costanza is your mentor?,140
11049,JERRY, About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?,140
11050,JERRY," As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protégé of my own.",140
11051,JERRY, A Mister Kenneth Bania.,140
11052,JERRY, I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.,140
11053,JERRY," Well, I don't think I want to date a protégé whose mentor is a Costanza.",140
11054,ELAINE," I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.",140
11055,ELAINE," Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?",140
11056,ELAINE," Come on, don't be a baby.",140
11057,ELAINE, That's it?,140
11058,ELAINE, Mm. This food is fantastic.,140
11059,JERRY, Have you tried the hamentashen?,140
11060,ELAINE, I can't get off the kishkas.,140
11061,JERRY, Bania?,140
11062,JERRY, Risk management?,140
11063,KRAMER, Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.,140
11064,KRAMER," You know Frank, you could take a break.",140
11065,ELAINE, You're quitting?,140
11066,ELAINE," Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!",140
11067,GEORGE, Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?,140
11068,GEORGE, They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.,140
11069,JERRY," Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.",141
11070,ELAINE," Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.",141
11071,JERRY," Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?",141
11072,ELAINE," What is this, a 'bit'?",141
11073,JERRY, No.,141
11074,ELAINE, 'Cos I'm not in the mood.,141
11075,JERRY," We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!",141
11076,ELAINE," Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.",141
11077,JERRY, They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.,141
11078,ELAINE,"  Alright, are you done with your little amusement?",141
11079,JERRY,  Then you admit it was amusing?,141
11080,ELAINE," It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.",141
11081,JERRY,  Great. Thanks.,141
11082,ELAINE," So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?",141
11083,ELAINE,"  Oh, Farbman.",141
11084,ELAINE," Mm, love Farbman.",141
11085,ELAINE," Wuh, if you call that living.  Ahaha.",141
11086,ELAINE, Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?,141
11087,ELAINE, Brett? Don't you think that would be great?,141
11088,ELAINE, Brett?,141
11089,ELAINE, Huh?,141
11090,JERRY, So when do I meet this jerk?,141
11091,ELAINE," He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.",141
11092,JERRY, Who?,141
11093,ELAINE,"  I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.",141
11094,JERRY, What song?,141
11095,ELAINE, Desperado.,141
11096,JERRY, Desperado?,141
11097,ELAINE, Uh huh.,141
11098,JERRY, And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.,141
11099,JERRY,"  See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.",141
11100,ELAINE, Uh huh.,141
11101,JERRY, I invented that.,141
11102,ELAINE," That, had to be invented?",141
11103,JERRY," When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.",141
11104,ELAINE,"  Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?",141
11105,JERRY, Elaine.,141
11106,ELAINE," Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.",141
11107,JERRY," Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.",141
11108,ELAINE,  Ohh.,141
11109,JERRY, I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.,141
11110,JERRY, In his dreams.,141
11111,ELAINE," Alright, can we  go?",141
11112,JERRY,"  By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.",141
11113,JERRY, It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.,141
11114,GEORGE,  I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.,141
11115,JERRY,  Those belong to people.,141
11116,KRAMER, Hey. Well.  This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.,141
11117,JERRY,"  Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.",141
11118,GEORGE, What checks?,141
11119,KRAMER," Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.",141
11120,JERRY, I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.,141
11121,KRAMER," Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.",141
11122,JERRY,"  They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.",141
11123,GEORGE, Look at all of those! You're rich!,141
11124,JERRY, Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.,141
11125,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?",141
11126,JERRY, Why?,141
11127,KRAMER,"  Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.",141
11128,GEORGE, He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?,141
11129,JERRY," Ah, who are any of her losers?",141
11130,GEORGE,  You're on that list.,141
11131,GEORGE," Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.",141
11132,KRAMER," Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?",141
11133,KRAMER, They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.,141
11134,GEORGE," So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.",141
11135,JERRY," I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.",141
11136,JERRY, Signed over a hundred checks this morning.,141
11137,KRAMER," Hello, twelve dollars.",141
11138,KRAMER,"  Oh, yeah, sure.",141
11139,JERRY, I'm gonna ask this guy something.,141
11140,JERRY,"  Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?",141
11141,KRAMER,"  Hey, are you folks from Japan.",141
11142,KRAMER,  You recognise that mug?,141
11143,KRAMER, That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.,141
11144,KRAMER," Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him.",141
11145,KRAMER," Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.",141
11146,KRAMER," Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.",141
11147,KRAMER," Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.",141
11148,GEORGE,  Here it comes.,141
11149,GEORGE,"  Sorry.  You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?",141
11150,GEORGE,"  So, that's it?",141
11151,GEORGE,"  I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.",141
11152,JERRY, Hey.,141
11153,ELAINE, What's with the claw?,141
11154,JERRY, Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.,141
11155,ELAINE," Oh, Brett.  This is Jerry.",141
11156,JERRY, Hi.,141
11157,JERRY," Ah, I'm one kind.",141
11158,ELAINE, Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?,141
11159,JERRY, The Fleckman.,141
11160,JERRY, Right.,141
11161,ELAINE, You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.,141
11162,JERRY,"  Oh, I'm sure they are.",141
11163,JERRY," No. I'm fine, thank you.",141
11164,JERRY,  I don't write skits.,141
11165,ELAINE," Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.",141
11166,ELAINE," Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?",141
11167,JERRY," Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?",141
11168,JERRY, You look like you could use a...,141
11169,ELAINE,  Jerry.,141
11170,KRAMER,"  Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?",141
11171,KRAMER,  Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.,141
11172,KRAMER, Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.,141
11173,ELAINE, Why? Why d'you think he's upset?,141
11174,ELAINE,"  We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?",141
11175,ELAINE,  Brett? Everything alright?,141
11176,ELAINE,  Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?,141
11177,ELAINE,"  Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...",141
11178,ELAINE,  Sorry.,141
11179,JERRY, No spiel?,141
11180,GEORGE,  Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!,141
11181,JERRY, So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?,141
11182,GEORGE, They could've at least tried!,141
11183,JERRY," You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?",141
11184,GEORGE, Please.,141
11185,JERRY, Too dumb?,141
11186,JERRY,  Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.,141
11187,KRAMER," Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends.  They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.",141
11188,JERRY, Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.,141
11189,KRAMER," Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?",141
11190,KRAMER, That's right.,141
11191,GEORGE, How'd you hook up with these guys?,141
11192,KRAMER," Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.",141
11193,JERRY, What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?,141
11194,KRAMER,"  Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.",141
11195,GEORGE,"  Yeah, the pilot!",141
11196,KRAMER," That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.",141
11197,GEORGE,"  And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!",141
11198,JERRY, Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.,141
11199,GEORGE,"  It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!",141
11200,KRAMER," George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.",141
11201,GEORGE,  So? What d'you think?,141
11202,GEORGE," Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.",141
11203,JERRY, No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.,141
11204,GEORGE," Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long.  You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.",141
11205,JERRY,  Sorry. My hand is numb.,141
11206,GEORGE,  Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. ,141
11207,ELAINE," Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.",141
11208,JERRY,  What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?,141
11209,ELAINE," He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.",141
11210,JERRY," You know, what you need is a song you can share.",141
11211,ELAINE, Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.,141
11212,JERRY," Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?",141
11213,ELAINE,  I like Witchy Woman.,141
11214,JERRY, Witchy Woman?,141
11215,ELAINE," You know, Witchy Woman.  'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.",141
11216,JERRY,  Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.,141
11217,KRAMER,"  Hey, man.",141
11218,ELAINE, Hey.,141
11219,JERRY, Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?,141
11220,KRAMER," Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.",141
11221,JERRY, Ah.,141
11222,KRAMER," Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?",141
11223,JERRY, What for?,141
11224,JERRY, I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?,141
11225,KRAMER," Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.",141
11226,JERRY," Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?",141
11227,KRAMER," Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.",141
11228,ELAINE, Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?,141
11229,KRAMER," Evidently.  Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.",141
11230,ELAINE, In them?!,141
11231,JERRY, You have them sleeping in drawers?!,141
11232,KRAMER," Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.",141
11233,JERRY, This has 'international incident' written all over it.,141
11234,KRAMER,"  Oh yeah, yeah.",141
11235,KRAMER," Goodnight, Mr Tanaka.",141
11236,KRAMER," Goodnight, Mr Oh.",141
11237,KRAMER," Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi.MR YAMAGUCHI",141
11238,JERRY, What is this?,141
11239,KRAMER," Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry.",141
11240,JERRY," Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.",141
11241,KRAMER,  Sayonara.,141
11242,JERRY,  Konichi-wa.,141
11243,ELAINE, Shh-shh!  What d'you think?,141
11244,ELAINE, What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.,141
11245,ELAINE," Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado?  We can share it.",141
11246,KRAMER," Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop.",141
11247,KRAMER,"  Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.",141
11248,JERRY,"  Hey, I'll take one.",141
11249,JERRY," Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see.  What've you got in a push-button mini.",141
11250,JERRY," Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?",141
11251,JERRY," Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?",141
11252,JERRY," So, could I...",141
11253,JERRY, Could I just buy an umbrella?,141
11254,JERRY,  What?!,141
11255,KRAMER," Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.",141
11256,GEORGE,"  Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.",141
11257,KRAMER,"  Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.",141
11258,GEORGE," Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.",141
11259,KRAMER,"  That's perfect.  Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?",141
11260,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.",141
11261,KRAMER,"  Hey, peanuts!",141
11262,GEORGE, Are they here?,141
11263,GEORGE,"  They haven't said anything to you, have they?",141
11264,GEORGE,"  What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!",141
11265,JERRY," Oh, hi Brett.",141
11266,JERRY," Ah, I didn't have enough money.",141
11267,JERRY," No, it's not that, it's the...",141
11268,JERRY," Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!",141
11269,JERRY," No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.",141
11270,JERRY,"  Not at the moment, Brett.",141
11271,JERRY,  Thanks for stopping!,141
11272,ELAINE," Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.",141
11273,JERRY, Boogeyman.,141
11274,ELAINE, Boogey?,141
11275,JERRY," I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?",141
11276,ELAINE," No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?",141
11277,JERRY,  Eehh.,141
11278,ELAINE,"  Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!",141
11279,JERRY, Hey.,141
11280,GEORGE,  Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!,141
11281,JERRY, Really? They bought the butler character?,141
11282,GEORGE,  Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.,141
11283,JERRY, NBC?,141
11284,GEORGE,  Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.,141
11285,JERRY, Ah. But they told us we must go now.,141
11286,GEORGE," But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.",141
11287,JERRY," Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is.  Just take it!",141
11288,GEORGE," Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?",141
11289,JERRY, Who?,141
11290,GEORGE, The network executive. You think she liked me?,141
11291,KRAMER, Heyy! Look who's here.,141
11292,KRAMER,"  Come on, I want you to come in here.",141
11293,GEORGE," Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas.  Big day tomorrow!",141
11294,JERRY,  Last one.,141
11295,JERRY,  Uugh! Ahh.,141
11296,KRAMER, There you are.,141
11297,GEORGE, Uh.  Where's the boys?,141
11298,KRAMER," Uh, no, I let 'em sleep in.",141
11299,KRAMER, I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.,141
11300,GEORGE,  But that meeting starts in ten minutes!,141
11301,KRAMER," No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.",141
11302,GEORGE,  I'm calling Jerry.,141
11303,JERRY, Yeah?,141
11304,GEORGE,"  Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!",141
11305,JERRY,  Uncle Leo?,141
11306,GEORGE,  Jerry!!,141
11307,JERRY," Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up.",141
11308,JERRY,"  Hmm, testy.",141
11309,JERRY, Hello?,141
11310,JERRY, It's stuck.  Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.,141
11311,JERRY, I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.,141
11312,JERRY,"  Don't worry, I'll get you out.",141
11313,ELAINE," Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.",141
11314,ELAINE," Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.",141
11315,ELAINE, Jerry?,141
11316,ELAINE, Jerry.,141
11317,GEORGE," So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?",141
11318,GEORGE,  Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?,141
11319,GEORGE, Mr Wilhelm? Wha..what're you doing here?,141
11320,GEORGE,  Him you brainwashed!  What's he got that I don't have?!,141
11321,GEORGE,"  Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!",141
11322,JERRY,"  Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.",141
11323,JERRY,  At least it was just the handle!,141
11324,JERRY, Fleckman?,141
11325,ELAINE," Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down.  'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'",141
11326,GEORGE," Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.",143
11327,JERRY, Why are we flyin' over the Andes?,143
11328,GEORGE," We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?",143
11329,JERRY, Kramer.,143
11330,GEORGE, So fast? What about me?,143
11331,JERRY, No.,143
11332,GEORGE," Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.",143
11333,JERRY," Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.",143
11334,GEORGE, Well I would eat you.,143
11335,JERRY," That's very nice, I guess.",143
11336,GEORGE, I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.,143
11337,JERRY," Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.",143
11338,GEORGE, Thank you.,143
11339,JERRY, Can I have a piece of that?,143
11340,GEORGE, No.,143
11341,GEORGE, With me or in general?,143
11342,GEORGE, Nucleosis.,143
11343,GEORGE," No, no, pff...",143
11344,JERRY, Six weeks?,143
11345,GEORGE," Yeah, six weeks.",143
11346,JERRY," Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.",143
11347,GEORGE, I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.,143
11348,JERRY," Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?",143
11349,GEORGE, I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.,143
11350,JERRY, What guys?,143
11351,GEORGE, Like us. ,143
11352,JERRY, Yeah.,143
11353,GEORGE, So it's just mono.,143
11354,ELAINE," Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.",143
11355,JERRY, I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.,143
11356,ELAINE," No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.",143
11357,JERRY," Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.",143
11358,GEORGE, No something is bunk and then you debunk it.,143
11359,JERRY, What?,143
11360,ELAINE, Huh?,143
11361,GEORGE, I think. ,143
11362,ELAINE," Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. ",143
11363,JERRY, Hello?,143
11364,JERRY," Oh hi, Katie.",143
11365,JERRY," I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.",143
11366,JERRY," Yes, all right, Katie.",143
11367,JERRY," Yes, bye.",143
11368,GEORGE, They asked you to do career day?,143
11369,JERRY," Yeah, it's no big deal.",143
11370,GEORGE," Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.",143
11371,JERRY, And you were integral.,143
11372,JERRY," I'm on next, right?",143
11373,JERRY, The guy with the lizard.,143
11374,JERRY, I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?,143
11375,ELAINE, So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?,143
11376,ELAINE," Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.",143
11377,ELAINE, When do you take this exam?,143
11378,ELAINE," Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.",143
11379,ELAINE," Well, can I introduce you as doctor?",143
11380,ELAINE," All right, that's all I wanted to know.",143
11381,GEORGE," It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.",143
11382,JERRY, So you're enjoying the not enjoying.,143
11383,GEORGE," you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.",143
11384,JERRY, I'm finding that out. ,143
11385,KRAMER," Hey, buddy. How was career day?",143
11386,JERRY," Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.",143
11387,GEORGE, You got bumped from career day?,143
11388,JERRY," It was a mix-up, I'm sure.",143
11389,KRAMER, They're trying to screw with your head.,143
11390,JERRY, Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?,143
11391,KRAMER, Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.,143
11392,GEORGE," Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.",143
11393,KRAMER," No, come on. ",143
11394,KRAMER," Come on, Larry. You know me.",143
11395,JERRY," You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.",143
11396,KRAMER," What, did they kick you out too?",143
11397,JERRY," No, let's just do it.  What? What is going on? What is that about?",143
11398,JERRY, But I was promised this slot.,143
11399,JERRY," Fire drill, can you believe that?",143
11400,GEORGE, What is Pericles?,143
11401,JERRY, Like fire in a school is such a big deal. ,143
11402,KRAMER," Hey, you got any matches?",143
11403,JERRY, Middle drawer.,143
11404,GEORGE, Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?,143
11405,KRAMER, Thanks. ,143
11406,JERRY, Hello?,143
11407,JERRY," Oh hi, Katie.",143
11408,JERRY," Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem.",143
11409,GEORGE, What is Borax?,143
11410,KRAMER, Ashtrays?,143
11411,JERRY," No, I don't have any ashtrays.",143
11412,KRAMER," Ooh, cereal bowls.",143
11413,JERRY," No, Katie, don't-- ",143
11414,KRAMER," All right, thanks. ",143
11415,GEORGE, What is Tungsten or Wolfram?,143
11416,JERRY, Is this a repeat?,143
11417,GEORGE," No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon,  what is chicken Kiev,  I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.",143
11418,JERRY," Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.",143
11419,GEORGE, You think?,143
11420,JERRY," Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain.  Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts",143
11421,GEORGE, Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. ,143
11422,KRAMER, Need some more matches.,143
11423,JERRY, What is goin' on in there?,143
11424,KRAMER," I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.",143
11425,JERRY, Why?,143
11426,KRAMER," Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.",143
11427,JERRY, It doesn't?,143
11428,KRAMER," Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.",143
11429,JERRY, All right.,143
11430,KRAMER, Yeah.,143
11431,ELAINE," So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?",143
11432,ELAINE, Oh my God.,143
11433,ELAINE," It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. ",143
11434,ELAINE," Oh hi, Sue Ellen.",143
11435,ELAINE," Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.",143
11436,ELAINE," Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.",143
11437,ELAINE," Well, there's a doctor right here.",143
11438,ELAINE, Can't you at least tell him what to do?,143
11439,ELAINE, I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.,143
11440,ELAINE," Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor.  George. ",143
11441,GEORGE, Of course. Absolute zero!,143
11442,ELAINE, What? What is with all these books?,143
11443,GEORGE, I stopped having sex.,143
11444,KRAMER," All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section.  Hey.",143
11445,JERRY," Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?",143
11446,KRAMER," Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. ",143
11447,JERRY, I was out.,143
11448,JERRY, An assembly?,143
11449,JERRY, I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?,143
11450,JERRY, Superfreak?,143
11451,ELAINE, What is your answer to number 74?,143
11452,ELAINE," No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!",143
11453,ELAINE, Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.,143
11454,GEORGE," Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant.  It's not complicated.",143
11455,GEORGE," George Costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary.",143
11456,GEORGE," Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?",143
11457,GEORGE, In six games.,143
11458,JERRY," ...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.",143
11459,GEORGE, Nine minutes.,143
11460,JERRY, How am I gonna fill two hours?,143
11461,GEORGE, Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.,143
11462,JERRY, And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. ,143
11463,GEORGE," Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?",143
11464,GEORGE, Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.,143
11465,GEORGE," Eh, don't mention it.",143
11466,ELAINE, Portuguese?,143
11467,GEORGE," Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.",143
11468,ELAINE, How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?,143
11469,JERRY, Are you all right?,143
11470,ELAINE," I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.",143
11471,JERRY," Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.",143
11472,ELAINE, What? What are you talking about?,143
11473,JERRY," To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.",143
11474,ELAINE, I don't understand.,143
11475,JERRY, Exactly.,143
11476,KRAMER, Hey buddy.,143
11477,JERRY, Hey.,143
11478,KRAMER," Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.",143
11479,JERRY, What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.,143
11480,KRAMER," What?  My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.",143
11481,JERRY, It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?,143
11482,KRAMER," Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.",143
11483,JERRY," And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.",143
11484,KRAMER," Look away, I'm hideous.",143
11485,ELAINE," Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.",143
11486,ELAINE, Pooh...,143
11487,JERRY, So what did you do?,143
11488,GEORGE, I told her I would have to think about it.,143
11489,JERRY," But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?",143
11490,GEORGE, I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.,143
11491,JERRY," You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.",143
11492,GEORGE, Simple joke from a simple man.,143
11493,JERRY, So you're never gonna have sex again?,143
11494,GEORGE," Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.",143
11495,JERRY, So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?,143
11496,GEORGE," Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.",143
11497,JERRY, I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.,143
11498,KRAMER, Jackie we gotta talk.,143
11499,KRAMER, But Jackie--,143
11500,KRAMER," Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.",143
11501,KRAMER, The tobacco companies.,143
11502,KRAMER," No, it didn't say anything.",143
11503,KRAMER," So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?",143
11504,JERRY, How ya doin'?,143
11505,ELAINE, Not good. I'm a moron.,143
11506,JERRY," Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.",143
11507,ELAINE," Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?",143
11508,JERRY, What for? Oh come on.,143
11509,ELAINE, I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.,143
11510,JERRY, I think it has something to do with me.,143
11511,ELAINE, You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.,143
11512,JERRY,"  No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.",143
11513,ELAINE," Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?",143
11514,GEORGE," You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--",143
11515,GEORGE," I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.",143
11516,GEORGE, What a fascinating turn of events. ,143
11517,GEORGE," Si, por favor.",143
11518,KRAMER, Who could love me?,143
11519,KRAMER," Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich.",143
11520,ELAINE, Congratulations! You passed!,143
11521,ELAINE, What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?,143
11522,ELAINE," Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?",143
11523,GEORGE, Hey.,143
11524,JERRY," Where have you been? You know, you're on next.",143
11525,GEORGE, I got lost on the way over.,143
11526,JERRY, Got lost? We went to school here for three years.,143
11527,GEORGE, What are these?  Take me to your leader.,143
11528,JERRY, Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!,143
11529,GEORGE," No, the Portuguese waitress.",143
11530,JERRY, The Portuguese waitress?,143
11531,GEORGE," I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.",143
11532,GEORGE," No, no. I'm not going on.",143
11533,JERRY, Then what'd you come down here for?,143
11534,GEORGE, Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.,143
11535,JERRY, It's good to have you back.,143
11536,JERRY," All right, I'll do it.  Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! ",143
11537,KRAMER," It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks.",143
11538,KRAMER," Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.",143
11539,KRAMER, She made an offer. I took it.,143
11540,KRAMER," No, no, no. There was no money.",143
11541,KRAMER, Check it out. ,143
11542,JERRY, Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.,143
11543,JERRY," Actually, it was a ********.",143
11544,JERRY, Jerry.,143
11545,GEORGE, Jerry!  Georgie's moving out!,144
11546,JERRY,  Get out!,144
11547,GEORGE," I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.",144
11548,JERRY,  Is it better than mine?,144
11549,GEORGE,  Oh yeah.,144
11550,JERRY," So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?",144
11551,GEORGE," You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. ",144
11552,JERRY, She's out.,144
11553,GEORGE,"  Oh right, the blind date.",144
11554,JERRY," Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.",144
11555,GEORGE, Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.,144
11556,JERRY, I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.,144
11557,GEORGE,"  Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. ",144
11558,JERRY,"  Oh, this is really annoying.",144
11559,GEORGE,  It's working already! ,144
11560,JERRY,  What is with that?!,144
11561,KRAMER," Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. ",144
11562,JERRY,  Where is your key?,144
11563,KRAMER," Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.",144
11564,JERRY," You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.",144
11565,KRAMER," Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. ",144
11566,JERRY,  Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?,144
11567,KRAMER,  Evidently.,144
11568,GEORGE,"  Yeah, uh, no menus. ",144
11569,GEORGE," Oh, right!  Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball",144
11570,GEORGE,"  Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.",144
11571,GEORGE,"  Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. ",144
11572,GEORGE, I remember.. ,144
11573,ELAINE," Where is this guy?!  I hate this!  I shoulda brought something to read..  ""Cancer in labratory animals"".. huh.",144
11574,ELAINE, Yeah?,144
11575,ELAINE,  Stabbed?!,144
11576,JERRY,  You ate more bread?,144
11577,ELAINE, That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!,144
11578,JERRY, Did you find out who stabbed him?,144
11579,ELAINE," Yeah,  It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.",144
11580,JERRY,"  Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.",144
11581,ELAINE," Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion.  I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.",144
11582,JERRY,"  Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.",144
11583,KRAMER,  Hey. How's everybody? ,144
11584,JERRY, Hey.,144
11585,ELAINE, Hey.,144
11586,KRAMER, Ehh..  No expiration date on this.. ,144
11587,JERRY," There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.",144
11588,KRAMER,"  Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line..  Plus, the botched my vasectimy.",144
11589,JERRY,  The botched it?,144
11590,KRAMER,  I'm even more potent now!,144
11591,GEORGE, Hey.,144
11592,JERRY, Hey. How's the new place?!,144
11593,GEORGE, Gone.  The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..,144
11594,ELAINE, Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?,144
11595,JERRY,  Edmund Fitzgerald.,144
11596,ELAINE, I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.,144
11597,JERRY,"  No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.",144
11598,GEORGE,  You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..,144
11599,ELAINE, I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.,144
11600,JERRY,"  Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.",144
11601,KRAMER,  The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. ,144
11602,GEORGE, How do you know?,144
11603,KRAMER," it's in my book - ""Astonishing Tales of the Sea"" 51 people died.",144
11604,GEORGE," 51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!",144
11605,KRAMER," There were 1,650 survivors.",144
11606,GEORGE," That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? ",144
11607,KRAMER," Oh yeah. I also got ""Astounding Bear Attacks""",144
11608,JERRY," Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?",144
11609,KRAMER," Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. ",144
11610,JERRY, Newman?,144
11611,JERRY," Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.",144
11612,JERRY,  What are you talking about?,144
11613,JERRY," ""Transfer""?",144
11614,JERRY, You quit the post office?,144
11615,JERRY," Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.",144
11616,JERRY,"  Well, a law's a law. ",144
11617,KRAMER," Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?",144
11618,ELAINE," I love shrimp!  I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me,  and I will eat it until my stomach pops!  Oh.. ",144
11619,ELAINE,"  Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?",144
11620,ELAINE, What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?,144
11621,ELAINE,  Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!,144
11622,JERRY, There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?,144
11623,ELAINE," Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.",144
11624,JERRY, Mmm.. Bad how?,144
11625,ELAINE,"  Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.",144
11626,JERRY,  I follow. So what are you gonna do?,144
11627,ELAINE," Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.",144
11628,JERRY,  What's more important?,144
11629,KRAMER,  Hey.,144
11630,GEORGE, What's with the dog?,144
11631,KRAMER,"  Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. ",144
11632,GEORGE, Oh..,144
11633,KRAMER,"  Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.",144
11634,GEORGE, A vet?,144
11635,KRAMER," Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a  lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog  - all on the same day.",144
11636,GEORGE," So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?",144
11637,KRAMER,"  You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers?  I'll see ya.",144
11638,GEORGE, Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.,144
11639,GEORGE," I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships.  The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? ",144
11640,GEORGE," Well, all vacations have to end eventually.",144
11641,GEORGE,"  According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence.  So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?",144
11642,GEORGE,"  It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!",144
11643,KRAMER," Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice.  I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice.  What's worse - he has a nagging cough.  Yeah, that's it. That's it.",144
11644,KRAMER,  What? No. That's disgusting..,144
11645,ELAINE,  What? Break-up? We went out on one date.,144
11646,ELAINE,"  Alright, good. Good.",144
11647,ELAINE, Pardon?,144
11648,ELAINE,  That's it?!  That's the best you got?! ,144
11649,GEORGE," So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!",144
11650,JERRY," You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the ""Astonishing Tales of Costanza"".",144
11651,GEORGE,  I should!,144
11652,JERRY," I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.",144
11653,GEORGE, I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!,144
11654,JERRY, You're the man!,144
11655,JERRY," I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment.  So, you want a protein shake, or something?",144
11656,GEORGE," Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. ",144
11657,JERRY,  Hello.. Newman.,144
11658,JERRY, What's the difference?,144
11659,JERRY," Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.",144
11660,JERRY, You're giving up that easy?,144
11661,JERRY,"  No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!",144
11662,JERRY,"  Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!",144
11663,JERRY,  An alliance.  Now get the hell outta here. ,144
11664,ELAINE, Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?,144
11665,JERRY,"  Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.",144
11666,ELAINE," Well, anyway, get this",144
11667,JERRY," ""Big head""  That's almost a compliment.",144
11668,ELAINE,  It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.,144
11669,JERRY, Hello?,144
11670,GEORGE,  Hey.,144
11671,JERRY," Hey, George.",144
11672,GEORGE," Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.",144
11673,JERRY, You can't make it?,144
11674,GEORGE," Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.",144
11675,JERRY, Alright. ,144
11676,ELAINE, Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?,144
11677,JERRY,  Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.,144
11678,ELAINE,"  Alright, well, I'll see ya. ",144
11679,JERRY," Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?",144
11680,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah.  I got some pilss. They taste terrible.",144
11681,JERRY,  Just swallow 'em.,144
11682,KRAMER,"  No, my throat's too tender.",144
11683,JERRY," Alright, sit down, sit down. ",144
11684,KRAMER, I don't want to!,144
11685,JERRY, C'mon. Just sit down!,144
11686,KRAMER,  Jerry! What?!,144
11687,JERRY, Sit down! Sit down!,144
11688,KRAMER,  Hey!,144
11689,JERRY, Lean your head back. Open your mouth!  Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!,144
11690,JERRY,"  What kind of pills are these, anyways?! ""For Smuckers""? ""May cause panting and loss of fur""?  These are dog pills!",144
11691,KRAMER, Whe have the same symptoms.,144
11692,JERRY," But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.",144
11693,KRAMER," No, no. No doctors.",144
11694,JERRY, Alright.. ,144
11695,KRAMER, Where are you going?,144
11696,JERRY, I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?,144
11697,KRAMER, I don't know..,144
11698,JERRY,"  C'mon, you wanna go for a ride?  Huh? C'mon! C'mon!",144
11699,ELAINE, What?,144
11700,KRAMER, I don't see any tissues back her..  Wait a minute!..  This isn't the way to the park!  Where are we going?.. I recognize this block!  You're taking me to the doctor!,144
11701,GEORGE," So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..",144
11702,GEORGE,  Mom.. dad.,144
11703,GEORGE,"  Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.",144
11704,JERRY," Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!",144
11705,KRAMER," No, Jerry!",144
11706,JERRY," Alright, that's it.. ",144
11707,KRAMER, No! Don't!,144
11708,JERRY," Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!",144
11709,JERRY," Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered?  What happened?",144
11710,JERRY, Bit you?!,144
11711,JERRY,"  Well, what if I deliver it?",144
11712,JERRY," Well, why not?",144
11713,JERRY, What am I gonna wear?,144
11714,JERRY,  I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!,144
11715,JERRY,  There you go. Merry Chirstmas!,144
11716,JERRY,  Oops. ,144
11717,GEORGE," I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear,  where I remained..  She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi..  The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage..  Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole..  In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man.  Thank you.  Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out.  Thanks again. ",144
11718,JERRY," Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, ""Photographs - Do not bend"".",144
11719,JERRY, What?,144
11720,JERRY, How did they know?!,144
11721,JERRY,  I tried my best!,144
11722,JERRY," You know, this is your coat.",144
11723,ELAINE,  Really?,144
11724,GEORGE," It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.",144
11725,JERRY," Boy, he didn't know what he was up against.  So, when do you move into the apartment?",144
11726,GEORGE, They're making their decision today.,144
11727,JERRY, What's the matter with you?,144
11728,ELAINE, Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. ,144
11729,JERRY, What giant freak-head?,144
11730,ELAINE,  The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!,144
11731,JERRY," So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!",144
11732,ELAINE,"  What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.",144
11733,JERRY,  Either way.,144
11734,ELAINE,  Alright.,144
11735,ELAINE,"  Oh, please.",144
11736,ELAINE,  So what?,144
11737,ELAINE,  What?!,144
11738,GEORGE," Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?",144
11739,GEORGE, What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!,144
11740,GEORGE," Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. ",144
11741,GEORGE, That's why they gave you the apartment?,144
11742,GEORGE," Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!",144
11743,JERRY," So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.",145
11744,ELAINE," I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?",145
11745,JERRY, Five minutes.,145
11746,ELAINE, Five minutes? That's it?,145
11747,JERRY, What's the difference? You never showed up.,145
11748,ELAINE," I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.",145
11749,JERRY," Well, we barely knew the guy.",145
11750,ELAINE," So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.",145
11751,JERRY, That's the way it works.,145
11752,ELAINE, When did you tell George to be here?,145
11753,JERRY, I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?,145
11754,ELAINE, About five.,145
11755,JERRY, That's enough. ,145
11756,KRAMER," So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.",145
11757,JERRY, How did you know about that?,145
11758,KRAMER," Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.",145
11759,JERRY, He can't do that.,145
11760,GEORGE, Fantastic day! Fantastic!,145
11761,JERRY, What happened?,145
11762,GEORGE,"  Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.",145
11763,JERRY, Fantastic.,145
11764,GEORGE," Then, I'm at The Foundation...",145
11765,JERRY, You're still doing that?,145
11766,GEORGE," Sometimes, once in a while.",145
11767,JERRY, When you feel guilty.,145
11768,GEORGE," No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.",145
11769,KRAMER, That's caged heat.,145
11770,GEORGE, Yeah-hah!,145
11771,JERRY, What are you gonna do there?,145
11772,GEORGE," Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight.  Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?",145
11773,JERRY," Yes, I know, I know.",145
11774,GEORGE," I noticed you eh, chose the eh ""clowns with balloons"" check design.",145
11775,JERRY," It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.",145
11776,ELAINE," Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.",145
11777,KRAMER," Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs.",145
11778,KRAMER, Yes! These are sweatshop eggs.,145
11779,JERRY, Is he from the future?,145
11780,ELAINE," No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.",145
11781,GEORGE," Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts.  This is guts.",145
11782,ELAINE, What? Clinging to some scraps?,145
11783,GEORGE," These are not ""scraps."" These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair.",145
11784,ELAINE," Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!",145
11785,JERRY," Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.",145
11786,JERRY, But it's your bodega.,145
11787,GEORGE, Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?,145
11788,GEORGE," Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in ""the box""?",145
11789,GEORGE," Thanks, Warden.",145
11790,GEORGE," Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me.  So you two uh, shop at the same store, ?",145
11791,GEORGE, Oh my God...You're in jail?  That is so cool!,145
11792,JERRY, You asked her out?,145
11793,GEORGE," Well...not ""out."" She's a prisoner.",145
11794,JERRY, How could you ask her out?,145
11795,GEORGE, Why not?,145
11796,JERRY, I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!,145
11797,GEORGE, That was different!,145
11798,JERRY, I'll say.,145
11799,GEORGE," Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?",145
11800,GEORGE," Yeah, no pop-in, no ""in the neighborhood,"" no ""I saw your light was on."" And the best part is, if things go really well...",145
11801,JERRY, Conjugal visit?,145
11802,KRAMER, Hey.,145
11803,GEORGE, Hey.,145
11804,KRAMER, What's up?,145
11805,JERRY, George is dating a convict.,145
11806,KRAMER, Oh? What's she in for? ,145
11807,GEORGE, Embezzlement.,145
11808,JERRY," Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?",145
11809,KRAMER," Well, not here.",145
11810,KRAMER, Okay ,145
11811,JERRY," Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?",145
11812,KRAMER," Well, it's chicken feed. ",145
11813,JERRY, I sense something is afoot.,145
11814,KRAMER," Yeah, I bought a chicken.",145
11815,GEORGE, Allow me. Why?,145
11816,KRAMER," Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.",145
11817,JERRY," Allow me. What are you, an idiot?",145
11818,KRAMER, No ,145
11819,ELAINE," Hm.  Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God.",145
11820,ELAINE," Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.",145

11883,JERRY, It's inhumane!,145
11884,KRAMER," No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.",145
11885,JERRY, It's two roosters peckin' at each other!,145
11886,KRAMER, What?,145
11887,JERRY, Yeah!,145
11888,KRAMER," Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like ""American Gladiators.""",145

11894,JERRY, You let him fight?,145
11895,KRAMER," Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.",145
11896,JERRY, How long do they usually last?,145
11897,KRAMER, Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.,145

11905,JERRY, O.K. ,145
11906,JERRY," Ah, I'm so sorry.",145
11907,GEORGE, She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies.  Talking...,145
11908,JERRY," In other words, a normal relationship.",145
11909,GEORGE," Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.",145
11910,JERRY," Well, she'll still be an ex-con.",145
11911,GEORGE, It's not the same.,145
11912,JERRY," Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.",145
11913,ELAINE, Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?,145
11914,ELAINE," You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.",145

11919,JERRY, 85 cents? That is Outrageous!,145
11920,JERRY," Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.",145
11921,KRAMER," Well, that's out of the question.",145
11922,JERRY," But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.",145
11923,KRAMER," Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!",145
11924,JERRY," No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!",145
11925,KRAMER," You know, I think you're jealous.",145
11926,JERRY, Of what?,145
11927,JERRY," Kramer, give me that rooster!",145
11928,KRAMER, Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! ,145
11929,GEORGE," Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.",145
11930,GEORGE," Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - ""the gang,"" as she likes to call them , you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that.",145
11931,JERRY, Kramer won't sell.,145
11932,JERRY," Oh well, thank you, Marcelino.",145
11933,JERRY, You want Little Jerry to take a dive?,145
11934,JERRY," First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.",145
11935,JERRY," Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.",145
11936,JERRY," We'll see about that.  Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!",145
11937,KRAMER, O.K.!,145
11938,GEORGE," No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.",145
11939,GEORGE, You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter -  - then you won't be Kurt anymore.,145
11940,GEORGE," Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is.  Excuse me.",145
11941,GEORGE, Celia? W-w-what are you doing here?,145
11942,ELAINE, Kurt!,145
11943,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy he's lookin' good, huh Jerry?",145
11944,JERRY," Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today.  Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine!  What are you doing with that?",145
11945,KRAMER, I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.,145
11946,JERRY," Hey, Kramer...?",145
11947,JERRY, Be careful.,145
11948,GEORGE, Hey.,145
11949,JERRY," Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!",145
11950,GEORGE, Is that good?,145
11951,JERRY, I don't know. Where have you been?,145
11952,GEORGE," Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!",145
11953,JERRY, Oh my God! “The break-out/pop-in!”,145
11954,GEORGE," Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -",145
11955,ELAINE," Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some ""fiance-time,"" I need some ""make-my-girlfriends-jealous"" time...",145
11956,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, that too.",145
11957,ELAINE,  I don't know...a year?,145
11958,ELAINE,  Could I see the ring again?,145
11959,ELAINE," Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.",145
11960,JERRY," Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.",145
11961,ELAINE," Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?",145
11962,GEORGE," Oh, hey, sorry I'm late.",145
11963,JERRY, Hey.,145
11964,GEORGE, Sorry I'm late.,145
11965,JERRY, Where's Celia?,145

11967,JERRY, hmm. ,145
11968,JERRY," Hey, how's he doin'?",145
11969,KRAMER," Ohh, He's got a big sweat going.  Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.",145
11970,KRAMER, There's Marcelino. ,145
11971,JERRY, Look at the size of his bird!,145
11972,KRAMER, That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.,145
11973,JERRY, He's a ringer!,145
11974,GEORGE, Where's the tamale guy?,145
11975,KRAMER, Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.,145

11979,ELAINE, Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!,145
11980,ELAINE," So, how long are you gonna be in here for?",145
11981,ELAINE,  So 10 to 14 months.,145
11982,KRAMER," Well, that was alright, huh?",146
11983,KRAMER," Well, um, goodnight.",146
11984,KRAMER,  Look at this.,146
11985,JERRY," Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.",146
11986,JERRY," Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.",146
11987,JERRY, Am I finally getting a baby brother?,146
11988,JERRY, What? The Cadillac I bought for you?,146
11989,JERRY," Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?",146

12032,GEORGE, Your parents'll never let you do it.,146
12033,JERRY, They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.,146

12112,JERRY,"  That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.",146
12113,ELAINE," Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.",146
12114,ELAINE," Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.",146
12115,ELAINE,  Where is your resume?,146
12116,ELAINE," Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?",146
12117,ELAINE, Yeah.,146
12118,ELAINE,"  Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.",146
12119,ELAINE, Uhm...,146
12120,ELAINE,  Mr Peterman. You're back.,146
12121,KRAMER,"  I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.",146
12122,KRAMER,  What?,146
12123,KRAMER, I do?,146
12124,KRAMER,"  There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.",146
12125,KRAMER," No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar.  Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth.  'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.",146
12126,JERRY, I live in New York.  What the hell happened?,146
12127,JERRY, What did you do?,146
12128,JERRY,"  You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.",146
12129,JERRY, My car? You drove it into the swamp!,146
12130,JERRY,"  You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.",146
12131,GEORGE,  Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?,146
12132,GEORGE, You bought that?,146
12133,KRAMER, Mornin'.,146
12134,KRAMER," Oh, boy.",146
12135,GEORGE, What the hell is going on here?,146
12136,KRAMER," I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.",146
12137,GEORGE,  Oh god.,146
12138,KRAMER," Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.",146
12139,GEORGE, Wait a minute.  You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!,146
12140,ELAINE,  What about my stock options?,146
12141,ELAINE," Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.",146
12142,ELAINE,"  It's, ah, Asian-Americans.",146
12143,ELAINE," Don't worry, I...",146
12144,ELAINE," Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...",146
12145,ELAINE,"  No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.",146
12146,ELAINE," So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.",146
12147,GEORGE,  But happy.,146
12148,ELAINE," Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...",146
12149,GEORGE, Obviously.,146
12150,ELAINE," Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.",146
12151,GEORGE," No, no. No, no, no.  We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.",146
12152,ELAINE," Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go.",146
12153,GEORGE," What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.",146
12154,ELAINE," Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...",146
12155,GEORGE,"  Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.",146
12156,ELAINE," Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.",146
12157,GEORGE," You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?",146
12158,ELAINE, What?,146
12159,GEORGE, You schedule a late meeting.,146
12160,ELAINE,  Huh? What does that do?,146
12161,GEORGE," These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped.  How did we get back onto you?!",146
12162,ELAINE,  I gotta split.,146
12163,GEORGE,"  You know, I got nothing outta this!",146
12164,KRAMER," Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.",146
12165,KRAMER," So, you sleep in separate beds.",146
12166,KRAMER,  Really?,146
12167,KRAMER, You can get that in your arms?,146
12168,JERRY," Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...",146
12169,JERRY, Well...,146
12170,JERRY, You didn't like that crack about the pen.,146
12171,GEORGE," Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...",146
12172,GEORGE,"  As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much.  So, I've decided, I want you to stay.",146
12173,GEORGE,  But you said it was my call.,146
12174,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.",146
12175,GEORGE,  You're letting him have a woman over?!,146
12176,ELAINE," Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.",146
12177,KRAMER, I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.,146
12178,KRAMER,  Yeah.,146
12179,KRAMER,"  Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.",146
12180,KRAMER, I've had it with 'em.,146
12181,KRAMER,"  Okay, okay. What time?",146
12182,KRAMER,  Ahh. That was alright.,146
12183,ELAINE," 'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'",146
12184,JERRY," Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...",146
12185,ELAINE,  Yeah.,146
12186,GEORGE,  That's a shame.,146
12187,ELAINE,"  What, are you sticking it to me?",146
12188,GEORGE,  What?,146
12189,ELAINE, I think you're sticking it to me.,146
12190,JERRY," Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.",146
12191,ELAINE,  Stickin' it!,146
12192,JERRY, You're not alone. I'm practically broke.,146
12193,ELAINE, Really?,146
12194,JERRY," No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.",146
12195,GEORGE,  Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious.,146
12196,JERRY," Well, you seem happy.",146
12197,GEORGE, I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away.  I'm basking in the buffer zone.  'Nother piece of pie here!,146
12198,ELAINE," So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?",146
12199,JERRY," Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet.",146
12200,ELAINE, Hmm.,146
12201,GEORGE,"  Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?",147
12202,GEORGE,  The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp!  Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said!  Dammit!,147
12203,JERRY," 'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?",147
12204,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'",147
12205,JERRY,  Really? That's great. You said that to him?,147
12206,GEORGE,"  Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.",147
12207,JERRY, Oh. That's not quite the same.,147
12208,GEORGE, No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.,147
12209,JERRY, I'm gonna grab a can of balls.,147
12210,GEORGE, Right.,147
12211,JERRY, I need a can of balls.,147
12212,KRAMER," Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes?",147
12213,ELAINE," Oh.  Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah.  This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.",147
12214,KRAMER," Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.",147
12215,ELAINE," Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream.",147
12216,KRAMER,"  I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.",147
12217,ELAINE,"  'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.",147
12218,KRAMER," Yeah, went straight to video.",147
12219,KRAMER,  That makes me the premiere.,147
12220,ELAINE,  Hah.,147
12221,KRAMER," Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?",147
12222,JERRY, No.,147
12223,KRAMER," It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.",147
12224,JERRY,"  'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'",147
12225,KRAMER," Can you do that for me, buddy?",147
12226,JERRY," Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.",147
12227,KRAMER," Well, I'm gonna type it up.",147
12228,JERRY," Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.",147
12229,KRAMER," Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me.  I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.",147
12230,KRAMER," Oh, hey, new racquet, huh?",147
12231,JERRY," Yeah.  I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.",147
12232,JERRY," In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.",147
12233,KRAMER,"  Well, you're not gonna need this any more.",147
12234,JERRY,"  Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.",147
12235,KRAMER,"  Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page.",147
12236,ELAINE,"  Oh. Oh, bravo, Vincent. Bravo. ",147
12237,ELAINE, What?,147
12238,ELAINE, Who is it?,147
12239,ELAINE, Of Vincent's picks?,147
12240,JERRY, He called you?,147
12241,ELAINE," He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.",147
12242,JERRY, To a guy you've never met?  Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.,147
12243,ELAINE, Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.,147
12244,ELAINE,  Yeah.,147
12245,ELAINE,"  Oh god, that guy's terrible.",147
12246,JERRY,  Mmm-hmm.,147
12247,ELAINE," Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?",147
12248,JERRY, George used up all my guest passes already.,147
12249,ELAINE, Ah.,147
12250,JERRY, Come on.,147
12251,JERRY,  Here you go.,147
12252,JERRY,  Milos?,147
12253,ELAINE, So he was bad. What d'you care?,147
12254,JERRY," Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.",147
12255,KRAMER," Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.",147
12256,ELAINE, The executor? Of what?,147
12257,JERRY, Kramer wants to die with dignity.,147
12258,ELAINE, There's a feather in your cap.,147
12259,KRAMER," I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. ",147
12260,GEORGE," Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.",147
12261,JERRY, D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?,147
12262,GEORGE," I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.",147
12263,ELAINE, Who's Reilly?,147
12264,JERRY," George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'",147
12265,GEORGE, Listen to the comeback.  'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.',147
12266,GEORGE,  Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!,147
12267,ELAINE," How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?",147
12268,GEORGE,  What does that mean?,147
12269,JERRY,"  Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'",147
12270,GEORGE,"  No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.",147
12271,KRAMER," Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.",147
12272,GEORGE,  I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.,147
12273,KRAMER," Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...",147
12274,GEORGE,"  Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!",147
12275,KRAMER,  Did you take this out of the garbage?,147
12276,JERRY," Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.",147
12277,KRAMER," Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk.  How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?",147
12278,KRAMER,  You see? You can't let go.,147
12279,JERRY," Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.",147
12280,KRAMER," I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?",147
12281,ELAINE, Me?,147
12282,KRAMER," Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.",147
12283,ELAINE,"  Oh, ho, c'mon.",147
12284,KRAMER," Well, would I be able to communicate?",147
12285,ELAINE," Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.",147
12286,KRAMER," Huhh, yeah, let's pull the cord.",147
12287,ELAINE, Yank it like  you're starting a mower.,147
12288,KRAMER," Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.",147
12289,KRAMER," Naw, that's not my style.",147
12290,ELAINE, Bore-ing.,147
12291,KRAMER,  Uhm...,147
12292,ELAINE, I'd stick.,147
12293,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. Stick.  'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.",147
12294,ELAINE,  That's right.,147
12295,JERRY, Hello Milos.,147
12296,JERRY,"  You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.",147
12297,JERRY, You can't even play.,147
12298,JERRY, You could do that?,147
12299,JERRY,"  Game, set and match, huh Milos?",147
12300,JERRY,"  You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...",147
12301,JERRY,"  Yeah, you'll make it up to me.",147
12302,JERRY," Tennis, anyone?",147
12303,ELAINE," Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning.  'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?",147
12304,KRAMER," That's a lotta yearning, huh?",147
12305,ELAINE," You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.",147
12306,KRAMER," Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.",147
12307,ELAINE, Really?,147
12308,KRAMER,"  See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh?  Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise.",147
12309,ELAINE,  Huh.  Well...,147
12310,KRAMER, Yeah. ,147
12311,ELAINE," Yeah, I could use a chuckle.",147
12312,KRAMER,  Yeah.,147
12313,ELAINE, What're you getting?,147
12314,KRAMER," Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.",147
12315,ELAINE, Oh. How much you got left?,147
12316,KRAMER," Yeah, about two hours.",147
12317,KRAMER," Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.",147
12318,ELAINE,"  Bernie is dead, you moron!  Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?!  Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway?  Ugh!",147
12319,ELAINE, Hello.,147
12320,ELAINE, Vincent?,147
12321,ELAINE,"  No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.",147
12322,ELAINE, Vincent?,147
12323,GEORGE," Wha..wait a minute, wha..what about Reilly?",147
12324,GEORGE,  What? I..I didn't hear about that.,147
12325,JERRY, Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?,147
12326,JERRY,"  Hoh, that Milos.  Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?",147
12327,JERRY,  Alright.,147
12328,JERRY,  Gotta be an easier way.,147
12329,JERRY," So, you play tennis?",147
12330,JERRY," Not for me, I love chatting.",147
12331,JERRY, Who?,147
12332,JERRY,  Your husband?!,147
12333,GEORGE," So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?",147
12334,JERRY,  He's new around here.,147
12335,GEORGE,"  So, details?",147
12336,JERRY,"  Well, I didn't sleep with her.",147
12337,GEORGE," Because of society, right?",147
12338,JERRY,"  Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?",147
12339,GEORGE, Reilly is no longer with the club.  You believe that?,147
12340,JERRY," Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.",147
12341,GEORGE," Yeah, I'm gonna let it go.",147
12342,JERRY," You never really had the right comeback, anyway.",147
12343,GEORGE,"  Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say.",147
12344,KRAMER," Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end.",147
12345,GEORGE,"  Ohh, I wanted to see that.  Thanks. Thanks a lot.",147
12346,KRAMER, I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.,147
12347,JERRY, I didn't know it was possible not to know that.,147
12348,KRAMER,"  Oh, unforgettable.",147
12349,KRAMER,"  I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug.",147
12350,ELAINE," What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...",147
12351,KRAMER," Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing.  Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.",147
12352,ELAINE," Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?",147
12353,ELAINE, What're you doing?,147
12354,ELAINE, Wha..wha...?,147
12355,ELAINE,"  Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?",147
12356,ELAINE,  Gene's trash.,147
12357,ELAINE,  Hi.,147
12358,JERRY," Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.",147
12359,JERRY, I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.,147
12360,JERRY,"  Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.",147
12361,JERRY, So you hurt Vincent's feelings?,147
12362,ELAINE,  Look what came in the mail today.,147
12363,JERRY,  Wh..What's this?,147
12364,ELAINE," It's the play button, off his VCR.",147
12365,JERRY,"  Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth.",147
12366,GEORGE,"  So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.",147
12367,ELAINE, Ohio?,147
12368,GEORGE, Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.,147
12369,JERRY,"  You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?",147
12370,GEORGE," Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.",147
12371,ELAINE," See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.",147
12372,GEORGE,"  It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it.  And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!",147
12373,GEORGE,  Not you.,147
12374,ELAINE, Hello.,147
12375,ELAINE,  Vincent.  Where are you? I have to meet you.,147
12376,ELAINE," Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive.  Now, let's have a look at you.",147
12377,KRAMER,"  Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed.",147
12378,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will.",147

12431,GEORGE,  Frog is wrong.,148
12432,GEORGE,"  I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.",148
12433,GEORGE,"  Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.",148
12434,GEORGE,  I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.,148

12444,KRAMER," Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic,  and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye.  So I give hime the crook-eye back,  you know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!",148
12445,JERRY, The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?,148
12446,KRAMER," Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know,  they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom.  I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.",148
12447,ELAINE, What? What happened?,148
12448,KRAMER, Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this  I'm only showing eight fingers.,148
12449,JERRY," Well, what does that mean?",148
12450,KRAMER," That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President..  They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!",148
12451,JERRY,  She coming of a bad break-up?,148
12452,JERRY, Any messages?,148
12453,JERRY, They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.,148
12454,GEORGE," So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. ",148
12455,JERRY, There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.,148
12456,GEORGE, Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?,148
12457,JERRY," No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!",148
12458,GEORGE,"  Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.",148
12459,JERRY, Yeah?,148
12460,GEORGE," I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..",148
12461,JERRY, Is he smart?,148
12462,GEORGE,  He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this,148
12463,JERRY, Hey! Just like you pretend to be.,148
12464,GEORGE," Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.",148
12465,JERRY, I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!,148
12466,ELAINE," Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. ",148
12467,ELAINE," Well,  what part of your life  do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?",148

12470,ELAINE," get, um, started..",148
12471,ELAINE,"  Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.",148
12472,ELAINE," You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?",148
12473,ELAINE, Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.,148
12474,ELAINE," But, that didn't happen to you.",148
12475,ELAINE," No, I - I really don't think you can do that.",148
12476,ELAINE, You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.,148
12477,JERRY, Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?,148
12478,JERRY," Actually, yeah.  Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?!  Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!",148
12479,JERRY, I guess that's all right.,148
12480,JERRY," No, absolutely nothing.  You're fantastic!  Hey guys!",148
12481,GEORGE, Hey.,148
12482,JERRY,"  Kramer, George, this is Ellen.",148
12483,GEORGE," Ladies and gentlemen, this  is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind.",148
12484,GEORGE, I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..,148
12485,GEORGE," Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be  an architect.",148
12486,GEORGE,"  Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.",148
12487,GEORGE,"  No, it's not.",148
12488,GEORGE,  It's called a T-square.,148
12489,KRAMER," And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.",148
12490,KRAMER," You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? ",148
12491,ELAINE," No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -",148

12495,KRAMER," Okay..  Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. ",148
12496,ELAINE, Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!,148
12497,KRAMER," Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.",148
12498,ELAINE, What happened to Bob Saccamano?,148
12499,KRAMER," Well, nothing. His part of the story is done.  So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.",148
12500,ELAINE," Alright, well, now that's something..",148
12501,KRAMER," Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..",148
12502,ELAINE,  A train is bearing down on you?!,148
12503,KRAMER," No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.",148
12504,ELAINE,  I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?,148
12505,KRAMER," Well, I guess I was..",148
12506,ELAINE,  What were you gonna wear on the way back?,148
12507,KRAMER," Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there!  All right, next story..",148

12512,ELAINE," Oh, thanks. I've got plans.",148
12513,KRAMER," Elaine, you should be there to document it.",148
12514,ELAINE,"  Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?",148
12515,KRAMER," Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.",148
12516,JERRY, So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?,148
12517,GEORGE," I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.",148
12518,JERRY," You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field.  Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.",148
12519,GEORGE, You're spending the weekend with Ellen?,148
12520,JERRY,"  Vermont!  With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to!  Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye.  What?  What is this?",148

12523,GEORGE," Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.",148
12524,JERRY, What?!,148
12525,KRAMER,"  Jerry, she's a loser. ",148
12526,JERRY, Where is this coming from? She's great!,148
12527,GEORGE,"  Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.",148
12528,JERRY, There's nothing wrong with my career!,148
12529,KRAMER,"  Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.",148
12530,GEORGE, I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!,148
12531,KRAMER," Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.",148
12532,GEORGE," Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!",148
12533,KRAMER," Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated.",148
12534,JERRY,  Alright! Excuse me!  I'm not buying any of this!,148
12535,KRAMER," All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!",148

12545,KRAMER," Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I- ",148
12546,ELAINE, You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.,148

12548,ELAINE, You signed the release.,148

12560,KRAMER," Uh.. ah,  Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying. ",148
12561,GEORGE,"  Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!",148
12562,KRAMER," Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.",148
12563,GEORGE," You mean, like, a former member?",148
12564,ELAINE," These Kramer stories are unusable!  I mean, some of them aren't even stories!  Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!",148
12565,JERRY, Is my toaster oven on there?,148
12566,ELAINE, How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?,148

12576,KRAMER," Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story!  So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! ",148

12677,JERRY, What for?,149
12678,KRAMER," Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!",149
12679,JERRY," But I don't want any ""sweet action.""",149
12680,KRAMER," Well, I couldn't do it",149

12694,GEORGE,"  Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball..  Ha ha!",149

12704,KRAMER,  Hey. ,149
12705,JERRY," Hey, I thought you went to the game.",149
12706,KRAMER, No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. ,149
12707,JERRY, Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!,149
12708,KRAMER,  W--Reggie Miller.,149

12710,KRAMER, Yeah. ,149
12711,JERRY," Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!",149
12712,KRAMER,"  Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. ",149
12713,ELAINE,"  --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--",149
12714,JERRY," Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean ""involved""?!",149
12715,KRAMER,"  Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. ""Involved."" An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.",149
12716,ELAINE, So that's it?,149
12717,KRAMER," Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. ",149
12718,JERRY, Can you believe that?,149
12719,ELAINE, I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.,149
12720,KRAMER,  The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!,149
12721,JERRY," What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!",149
12722,KRAMER," No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!",149
12723,JERRY, On what?!,149
12724,KRAMER,"  Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. ",149
12725,JERRY," Yeah, all right.",149

12735,JERRY, Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?,149
12736,JERRY, Why not?,149
12737,JERRY," Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. ""Phony""?",149
12738,JERRY," You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.",149
12739,JERRY,  Something wrong with this trunk.,149
12740,GEORGE," So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?  An' why Pomodoro?",149
12741,KRAMER,"  Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.",149
12742,GEORGE,  Uh-oh.,149
12743,KRAMER," We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.",149
12744,GEORGE, Can't we discuss this?,149
12745,KRAMER,  We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!,149
12746,GEORGE,  I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!,149
12747,KRAMER,"  So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. ",149
12748,GEORGE,  Are you?,149
12749,KRAMER, Wha--me? No! No. But she is.,149
12750,GEORGE," I, I can't believe this is happening!",149
12751,KRAMER," George, we're sorry.",149

12753,KRAMER,  Waaa-aa--aa! I'm sorry--,149
12754,ELAINE,"  Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. ",149
12755,ELAINE," Oh. No, we're not--",149
12756,ELAINE," Look.  We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..  name names!  Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--",149
12757,ELAINE," Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.",149
12758,ELAINE,  Her?,149
12759,ELAINE, Ah--this is part of the problem!,149
12760,ELAINE,"  You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!",149
12761,ELAINE,"  What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. ",149
12762,KRAMER, Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.,149
12763,JERRY, Well why doesn't he just come in?,149
12764,KRAMER," Because he's scared, Jerry.",149
12765,JERRY, Why is he scared.,149
12766,KRAMER,  Come on in. Did you do this? ,149
12767,JERRY," Yeah, but--",149
12768,KRAMER, Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.,149
12769,JERRY, It was an accident.,149
12770,KRAMER," Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?",149
12771,JERRY,  I don't want it that way.,149
12772,KRAMER," Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.",149
12773,JERRY,  Fine..,149
12774,KRAMER," See that was nice, Jerry.  Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.",149
12775,JERRY," Ah, it's just a car.",149

12785,JERRY,"  I don't know, I just see you guys together.",149
12786,JERRY, So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!,149
12787,ELAINE," Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.",149
12788,JERRY," Yeah, I know how you feel.",149
12789,ELAINE, Do you hear something?,149
12790,JERRY, What?,149
12791,JERRY," Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.",149
12792,ELAINE," Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!",149
12793,JERRY," Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.",149
12794,ELAINE, What?,149

12805,KRAMER," Oh. Oh, George.",149
12806,GEORGE, Please. Give me another chance.,149
12807,KRAMER,  Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this.  All right.,149

12813,KRAMER,  We're takin' George back--,149
12814,KRAMER, He's gonna make us very happy.,149
12815,ELAINE,  Look at this turnout.,149
12816,JERRY,  Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..,149
12817,ELAINE,  Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.,149
12818,ELAINE,"  Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.",149
12819,ELAINE, Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. ,149
12820,JERRY,  Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.  Her too.,149
12821,ELAINE, What can you say about a girl like Susie? ,149
12822,KRAMER, Hey.,149
12823,GEORGE," Where's uh, where's Allison..",149
12824,KRAMER," Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.",149
12825,GEORGE, But you took me back.,149
12826,KRAMER," Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. ",149
12827,GEORGE, Where are you goin'..,149
12828,KRAMER," The Ball, silly.",149
12829,GEORGE,"  No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.",149
12830,KRAMER, George. I thought you were gonna Change.,149
12831,GEORGE,  For her. Not for you.,149
12832,KRAMER,"  Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..",149
12833,GEORGE," All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!",149
12834,KRAMER," Oh, I'm with him.",149
12835,ELAINE," And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.",149
12836,ELAINE," Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. ",149
12837,JERRY,"  Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. ",149
12838,JERRY,"  Not only that, I broke his thumbs.",149
12839,ELAINE, Mr. Peterman..  I'm Susie.. She's me..,149
12840,ELAINE,  Suuuuuuuuuuze!,149
12841,JERRY," Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, ""Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. "" ""What are you watching?"" ""I don't care, I gotta keep going."" ""Who was that?"" ""I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going."" Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, ""Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel."" You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, ""Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed.""",15
12842,GEORGE,"  She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.",15
12843,JERRY," She's the performance artist, right?",15
12844,GEORGE,"  Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.",15
12845,JERRY," What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?",15
12846,ELAINE, Todd.,15
12847,JERRY, Todd. Oh yeah.  He's a Kennedy.,15
12848,ELAINE," No, he's not.",15
12849,JERRY," C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.",15
12850,ELAINE, By marriage.,15
12851,JERRY," Oh, by marriage.  We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.",15
12852,GEORGE, That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.,15
12853,ELAINE," Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.",15
12854,GEORGE," What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?",15
12855,JERRY," Thin ice, George. Thin ice..",15
12856,GEORGE,  Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.,15
12857,ELAINE, She stopped performing.,15
12858,GEORGE,"  Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.",15
12859,JERRY,  You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.,15
12860,GEORGE," She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her ""performances"".",15
12861,JERRY," Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?",15
12862,GEORGE," God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.",15
12863,ELAINE, It was an accident!,15
12864,GEORGE," Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. ""What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?""",15
12865,JERRY,  he thought he still had a shot.,15
12866,GEORGE," And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.",15
12867,JERRY, What ever happened with the shirt?,15
12868,GEORGE, I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.,15
12869,ELAINE, I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.,15
12870,JERRY, Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?,15
12871,ELAINE," anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.",15
12872,GEORGE, Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.,15
12873,JERRY, Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.,15
12874,GEORGE,  Ich bin ein sucker.,15
12875,ELAINE," Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..",15
12876,GEORGE, She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!,15
12877,ELAINE,"  I do have one teeny little problem, though.",15
12878,GEORGE, Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.,15
12879,ELAINE," See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..",15
12880,JERRY, But?,15
12881,ELAINE, My roommate has Lyme disease.,15
12882,JERRY, Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?,15
12883,ELAINE, She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.,15
12884,JERRY, How did she get Lyme disease?,15
12885,ELAINE," I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.",15
12886,JERRY, They still do that play?,15
12887,ELAINE, It's a classic.,15
12888,JERRY, With all the nudity?,15
12889,ELAINE, I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.,15
12890,GEORGE,  Never said goodbye. Goodbye!,15
12891,JERRY, Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.,15
12892,ELAINE, What do you wanna know?,15
12893,JERRY," Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?",15
12894,ELAINE, Rarely.,15
12895,JERRY," There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?",15
12896,ELAINE, No.,15
12897,JERRY, When is this suppose to be?,15
12898,ELAINE, Saturday.,15
12899,JERRY," Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?",15
12900,ELAINE, I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.,15
12901,JERRY," 'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.",15
12902,GEORGE," Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.",15
12903,JERRY, And if you do?,15
12904,GEORGE, I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.,15
12905,KRAMER, What are you doing this for? Look at you..,15
12906,JERRY, Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.,15
12907,KRAMER, But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.,15
12908,JERRY,  Leave me alone.,15
12909,KRAMER, It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!,15
12910,JERRY, I'm not getting illegal cable!,15
12911,KRAMER," Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.",15
12912,JERRY," No, I read in the paper..",15
12913,KRAMER,"  Oh, oh, the paper..",15
12914,JERRY," Well, they might hook us up again.",15
12915,KRAMER," Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the ""Big Mammoo.""  Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!",15
12916,JERRY, Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.,15
12917,KRAMER," Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!",15
12918,JERRY, What you're suggesting is illegal.,15
12919,KRAMER, It's not illegal.,15
12920,JERRY, It's against the law.,15
12921,KRAMER," Well, yeah.",15
12922,JERRY,"  Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?",15
12923,KRAMER,"  Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.",15
12924,JERRY," A real human rights nut, huh?",15
12925,KRAMER," Yeah. He's intense, man.",15
12926,JERRY, I don't know. What if I get caught?,15
12927,KRAMER," Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.",15
12928,JERRY," You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.",15
12929,KRAMER," No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.",15
12930,JERRY,"  Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..",15
12931,KRAMER," No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..",15
12932,JERRY,  Put it in.,15
12933,KRAMER," You won't regret it.  Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..",15
12934,JERRY, Seinfeld.,15
12935,JERRY, My cable hook-up? What about it?,15
12936,JERRY, It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?,15
12937,KRAMER," Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.",15
12938,JERRY," Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.",15
12939,KRAMER," No! Jerry!  Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..",15
12940,JERRY, Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?,15
12941,JERRY," What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?",15
12942,JERRY,  Are they gonna go over the instructions again?,15
12943,JERRY," I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, ""This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here.""",15
12944,GEORGE, Sounds like a rough trip.,15
12945,JERRY," Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.",15
12946,GEORGE," So, the college cancelled the gig?",15
12947,JERRY," Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.",15
12948,GEORGE,  Forget it.,15
12949,JERRY," No, really.. an airport run.",15
12950,GEORGE, It's nothing.,15
12951,JERRY," Hey, it's one thing if I asked you ""Could you do me a favor?"" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE",15
12952,JERRY,"  You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.",15
12953,GEORGE,  ..Ulterior motive.,15
12954,JERRY," Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.",15
12955,GEORGE,"  What, tonight? Now?",15
12956,JERRY," Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.",15
12957,GEORGE," My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.",15
12958,JERRY, You want to get a bite?,15
12959,GEORGE," Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.",15
12960,JERRY," Well, so what should we do?",15
12961,GEORGE, Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?,15
12962,JERRY, Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!,15
12963,GEORGE,  What are you talking about?,15
12964,JERRY, You're wearing the chocolate shirt!,15
12965,GEORGE, I am? What a strange coincidence..,15
12966,JERRY," A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..",15
12967,GEORGE,  You gotta let me go over there.,15
12968,JERRY," What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?",15
12969,GEORGE," No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, ""Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!""",15
12970,ELAINE," So, where's Todd?",15
12971,ELAINE," Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!",15
12972,ELAINE," Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?",15
12973,ELAINE,  What is this?! What are you doing here?,15
12974,KRAMER, We're putting in cable.,15
12975,ELAINE," The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!",15
12976,KRAMER," Oh, we have to do this now.",15
12977,ELAINE, Who's this guy?,15
12978,KRAMER, Which one?,15
12979,ELAINE, Both of the them.,15
12980,KRAMER," Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys.",15
12981,ELAINE, Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?,15
12982,KRAMER," Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah.",15
12983,ELAINE, You can't! You can't do this now!,15
12984,KRAMER," Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.",15
12985,ELAINE, Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.,15
12986,KRAMER,"  Anatoly!  Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.",15
12987,JERRY, And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?,15
12988,GEORGE,  What am I going to say?!,15
12989,JERRY, Yeah.,15
12990,GEORGE," What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!",15
12991,JERRY, You'll never say that to her face.,15
12992,GEORGE, Watch me.,15
12993,KRAMER,"  Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.",15
12994,ELAINE,"  Kramer, Kramer, look at him.  Look! He's eating all the food!",15
12995,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition.  Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?",15
12996,ELAINE, Kramer!,15
12997,KRAMER,  Uh.. Excuse me..,15
12998,ELAINE, What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.,15
12999,JERRY, The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.,15
13000,ELAINE," I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.",15
13001,JERRY," Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.",15
13002,ELAINE,"  George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!",15
13003,GEORGE,  About what?,15
13004,GEORGE, Leslie.,15
13005,GEORGE, George..  George Costanza.,15
13006,GEORGE,"  You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?",15
13007,GEORGE, You took me to one of your shows..,15
13008,GEORGE," And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..",15
13009,JERRY," I'm sorry, I..",15
13010,JERRY,"  Oh, I, I, think I remember..",15
13011,JERRY," Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..",15
13012,JERRY," No, I don't think that..",15
13013,GEORGE," Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..",15
13014,ELAINE, I'm sorry you have to go.,15
13015,JERRY," Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.",15
13016,KRAMER, Don't be a fool.,15
13017,JERRY," No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..",15
13018,JERRY,  Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!,15
13019,ELAINE," Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..",15
13020,ELAINE,"  Oh, thank you.  ""Like you were in college""?",15
13021,GEORGE,  I'll be right back. ,15
13022,JERRY,  I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!,15
13023,GEORGE," Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?",15
13024,ELAINE," Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.",15
13025,JERRY," Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?",15
13026,KRAMER,"  Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! ",15
13027,JERRY," What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. ""I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around."" ""Take care now."" Did you ever say that to somebody? ""Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now."" ""Take care. Take care."" What does this mean? ""Take off!"" Isn't that what you really want to say? ""Take off now.""",15
13028,JERRY, Morning.,150
13029,JERRY,"  Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?",150
13030,JERRY, Ooh-ooh,150
13031,GEORGE, So?,150
13032,JERRY, So? She used the toothbrush!,150
13033,GEORGE," You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?",150
13034,JERRY, Yeah.,150
13035,GEORGE," So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.",150
13036,JERRY, How many years of med school did you have?,150
13037,GEORGE, Was she mad?,150
13038,GEORGE, You didn't tell her.,150
13039,JERRY, Jenna's like me. She's very... ,150
13040,GEORGE, Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?,150
13041,JERRY, I'll take fastidious.,150
13042,JERRY, What is that?,150
13043,GEORGE," Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.",150
13044,JERRY," They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?",150
13045,GEORGE, Just the last few innings of a double-header.,150
13046,KRAMER," Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and  Dragged this thing for five exits.",150
13047,JERRY, Why didn't you pull over?,150
13048,KRAMER," Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.",150
13049,KRAMER," Well, look at that. A talking Nixon.",150
13050,ELAINE," Yeah, I'd like to place an order.",150
13051,ELAINE," This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?",150
13052,ELAINE, Forty-seven.,150
13053,ELAINE," Uh, that's it.",150
13054,ELAINE," Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E.",150
13055,ELAINE, I'm not below.,150
13056,ELAINE, Your guy can't cross to my side?,150
13057,ELAINE," Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.",150
13058,ELAINE,"  Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.",150
13059,KRAMER," Well, I'm a poppa.",150
13060,JERRY, Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.,150
13061,KRAMER,"  Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.",150
13062,JERRY," Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing.",150
13063,KRAMER," Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.",150
13064,JERRY," Aw, looks just like you.",150
13065,KRAMER," Aw, I'm beaming Jerry.",150
13066,JERRY, So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?,150
13067,KRAMER," They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.",150
13068,JERRY, That old scam.,150
13069,KRAMER," Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.",150
13070,JERRY," At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.",150
13071,KRAMER, Quality time.,150
13072,GEORGE, Keys. I can't find my keys.,150
13073,JERRY, You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!,150
13074,GEORGE, Have you seen 'em?,150
13075,JERRY, No.,150
13076,GEORGE, Dammit!,150
13077,KRAMER," C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?",150
13078,GEORGE," I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.",150
13079,KRAMER, Right.,150
13080,JERRY," Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.",150
13081,GEORGE, I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.,150
13082,JERRY, So?,150
13083,GEORGE, So you can't duplicate 'em.,150
13084,KRAMER, Sure you can.  Such a sweet kid.,150
13085,ELAINE," Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda?",150
13086,ELAINE, I... thought that I would meet you halfway.,150
13087,ELAINE," Oh yeah.  There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.",150
13088,ELAINE,  This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!,150
13089,JERRY," Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.",150
13090,GEORGE, So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?,150
13091,JERRY," By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?",150
13092,GEORGE," No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!",150
13093,GEORGE," Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.",150
13094,JERRY, You didn't look down?,150
13095,GEORGE, I was trying to stick the landing.  ...was right around here.,150
13096,GEORGE, No! No!!,150
13097,JERRY, Poor son of a bitch.,150
13098,JERRY, It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.,150
13099,JERRY, The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.,150
13100,JERRY," Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.",150
13101,JERRY,  When the battery runs out.,150
13102,JERRY," No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.",150
13103,JERRY, I don't know anything about that.,150
13104,JERRY, That's the idea.,150
13105,JERRY," You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.",150
13106,ELAINE, You still couldn't kiss her?,150
13107,JERRY," She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.",150
13108,ELAINE," Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.",150
13109,JERRY," Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.",150
13110,ELAINE," Jer, do you see where this is going?",150
13111,JERRY, Being really clean and happy?,150
13112,ELAINE," Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.",150
13113,JERRY, Disorder?,150
13114,ELAINE," And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.",150
13115,JERRY,"  Hmm, that could hurt me.  Hey, there it is.",150
13116,ELAINE, Shall we stop and say hi?,150
13117,JERRY," Nah, we've seen it.",150
13118,ELAINE, Yeah.,150
13119,KRAMER,"  Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!",150
13120,KRAMER," Mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle.",150
13121,ELAINE," Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh,  I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?",150
13122,ELAINE," You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.",150
13123,ELAINE," No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.",150
13124,ELAINE," No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.",150
13125,ELAINE," Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.",150
13126,JERRY, What's with the signs?,150
13127,KRAMER," Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts , I just rolled 'em into the woods.",150
13128,JERRY," Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.",150
13129,KRAMER,"  Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there.  Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.",150
13130,JERRY," Hey. So, keys?",150
13131,GEORGE, No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.,150
13132,JERRY, I guess they leave that up to the general population.,150
13133,GEORGE," I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!",150
13134,JERRY, Hard to say.,150
13135,KRAMER," Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.",150
13136,GEORGE, Really?,150
13137,KRAMER," Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.",150
13138,JERRY, Yeah?,150
13139,JERRY," If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.",150
13140,GEORGE, You think you could hook me up with these guys?,150
13141,KRAMER," Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.",150
13142,GEORGE, Seven-eight-four.,150
13143,JERRY, Hi.,150
13144,JERRY," Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.",150
13145,JERRY," Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip,  and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.",150
13146,JERRY, I'm sorry.,150
13147,JERRY, Obviously never.,150
13148,KRAMER, I need the yield sign.,150
13149,JERRY," Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?",150
13150,KRAMER, You could've introduced me.,150
13151,JERRY, I wouldn't know where to start.,150
13152,JERRY,"  Hey, Jenna. Hey!",150
13153,JERRY, What?! Wha... what'd you put in there?,150
13154,JERRY," Oh, man!",150
13155,JERRY,"  Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!",150
13156,ELAINE, She won't even give you a hint?,150
13157,JERRY, No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.,150
13158,ELAINE, You know what I bet it is?  Your remote.,150
13159,JERRY," Yes, that is a definite possibility.",150
13160,ELAINE,"  Or, could be your walkman there.",150
13161,JERRY, Are you just screwing with me?,150
13162,ELAINE," Yeah, I am.",150
13163,KRAMER, Hey ah.,150
13164,JERRY," Hey, how's life on the road?",150
13165,KRAMER," Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry.",150
13166,JERRY, I don't doubt it.,150
13167,KRAMER," You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.",150
13168,JERRY, What's this?,150
13169,KRAMER," Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? ",150
13170,JERRY, Isn't that some kind of safety thing?,150
13171,KRAMER," Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.",150
13172,JERRY, What the hell are you talking about?,150
13173,KRAMER," Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.",150
13174,ELAINE, How are you gonna widen the lanes?,150
13175,KRAMER," Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise.  So, you got any black paint?",150
13176,JERRY,"  Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.",150
13177,ELAINE,"  Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.",150
13178,JERRY, One-Q? Whose apartment is that?,150
13179,ELAINE," That's the janitor closet, across the street.",150
13180,JERRY," You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?",150
13181,ELAINE," It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.",150
13182,KRAMER, That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.,150
13183,ELAINE,  How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.,150
13184,KRAMER," Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.",150
13185,ELAINE," Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.",150
13186,KRAMER," Now, where's that tool shed of yours?",150
13187,ELAINE," Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.",150
13188,ELAINE, I'll see you.,150
13189,GEORGE," Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.",150
13190,GEORGE," Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.",150
13191,GEORGE," Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.",150
13192,GEORGE," Yeah, I know that.  Could you start, working?",150
13193,GEORGE,"  Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.  Is this about money?",150
13194,ELAINE," Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.",150
13195,ELAINE," Right, because... I'm the janitor. ",150
13196,ELAINE,  Yes ma'am.,150
13197,ELAINE, Oh it's you.,150
13198,JERRY, Is the flounder here yet?,150
13199,ELAINE," No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?",150
13200,ELAINE,  There's this.,150
13201,JERRY," Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.",150
13202,ELAINE,  The fish!,150
13203,ELAINE," Ah, what're you doing here?",150
13204,GEORGE, Hey.,150
13205,JERRY, Hey.,150
13206,GEORGE," Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.",150
13207,JERRY, Kramer's guys?,150
13208,GEORGE, Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.,150
13209,JERRY," Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.",150
13210,GEORGE, Ow!,150
13211,ELAINE," Uh, man!",150
13212,KRAMER," Huh, yeah.  Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.",150
13213,ELAINE, I'm plumb out.,150
13214,KRAMER," Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!",150
13215,ELAINE,"  Uh, Mrs Allister.  Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister.  Okay, I've gotta get out.",150
13216,ELAINE," Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.",150
13217,ELAINE," Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?",150
13218,ELAINE," Yeah, I am so sorry.",150
13219,ELAINE," Well, a lot of it is vegetable...",150
13220,ELAINE,  Yes ma'am.,150
13221,GEORGE, ...stop pushing.  Kramer spilled ammonia.,150
13222,JERRY, I don't feel like eating.,150
13223,KRAMER,"  I'm gonna borrow this, huh?",150
13224,ELAINE,  Janitor's meeting.,150
13225,JERRY," Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl.  Did you?",150
13226,JERRY," Well, whatever. So, how've you been?",150
13227,JERRY, Good.  Steak knife?,150
13228,JERRY, Nah.,150
13229,ELAINE, Hi.,150
13230,JERRY, Hi.,150
13231,ELAINE," Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?",150
13232,JERRY, For what?,150
13233,ELAINE, I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.,150
13234,JERRY," Dirt? That's alright,  because there's nothing wrong with dirt.",150
13235,ELAINE," Well, actually it's pretty grimy.",150
13236,JERRY," Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.",150
13237,ELAINE," Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.",150
13238,JERRY, Sure. Bye.,150
13239,ELAINE, Bye.,150
13240,ELAINE, Bye.,150
13241,JERRY," There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of...  Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!",150
13242,JERRY," Toilet brush, oh . Alright, I can replace that.",150
13243,JERRY," Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.",150
13244,JERRY, That's true.,150
13245,JERRY," But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.",150
13246,JERRY, I don't know what that could be.,150
13247,JERRY," Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.",150
13248,JERRY, Holy cow! Have a nice life.,150
13249,ELAINE," Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.",150
13250,KRAMER, Bugger!,150
13251,KRAMER, Double bugger!,150
13252,KRAMER, Hey buddy. What're you doing out here?,150
13253,KRAMER," Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.",150
13254,KRAMER," Hey, I gotta skedaddle. You wanna lift?",150
13255,KRAMER, Newman! Newman!!,150
13256,KRAMER," Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.",150
13257,JERRY," You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?",151
13258,ELAINE, Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?,151
13259,JERRY, He's wailing on that banjo.,151
13260,ELAINE, Yeah.,151
13261,JERRY, I just don't understand the raisinettes.,151
13262,ELAINE, The sax player?,151
13263,JERRY, Yeah.,151
13264,ELAINE, Yeah.,151
13265,JERRY," The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.",151
13266,ELAINE, So?,151
13267,JERRY, Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.,151
13268,ELAINE, HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.,151
13269,JERRY, Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.,151
13270,ELAINE, He's a musician.,151
13271,JERRY, Musicians. Get a real job.,151
13272,GEORGE," Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.",151
13273,GEORGE,  Really?,151
13274,GEORGE,  Like me?,151
13275,GEORGE,  Like me? But how?,151
13276,GEORGE," Yes, yes, I am.",151
13277,KRAMER," Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.",151
13278,KRAMER, Saved a fortune. Look at that. Heyy.,151
13279,JERRY,"  Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'.",151
13280,KRAMER, Yeah.,151
13281,JERRY,"  Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.",151
13282,KRAMER, Hey.,151
13283,GEORGE, Hey.,151
13284,JERRY, Hey.,151
13285,GEORGE, Hey. You ready?,151
13286,JERRY, Almost.,151
13287,KRAMER," Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house?",151
13288,JERRY,"  Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.",151
13289,KRAMER," Aw, c'mon man. Help a brother out.",151
13290,JERRY,  Alright.,151
13291,KRAMER, Yeahh. I owe you one.,151
13292,JERRY,  We're even.,151
13293,GEORGE," Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.",151
13294,JERRY,  That's a nice four seconds.,151
13295,GEORGE,  I look just like him. I. Me.  This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?,151
13296,JERRY, Maybe he has money.,151
13297,GEORGE,"  Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.",151
13298,JERRY,  Sometimes you do.,151
13299,GEORGE," Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.",151
13300,JERRY,  Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?,151
13301,GEORGE,"  She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.",151
13302,ELAINE,  What about Sack Lunch?,151
13303,ELAINE," Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.",151
13304,ELAINE,  Don't you wanna know how they got in there?,151
13305,ELAINE,  Aww. Sold out.,151
13306,ELAINE," So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?",151
13307,GEORGE,"  Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?",151
13308,GEORGE," Huh-Hi.  Uhm, is Neil here?",151
13309,GEORGE," Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.",151
13310,GEORGE,  Oh. Course not.,151
13311,GEORGE,"  Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...",151
13312,GEORGE, ...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?,151
13313,ELAINE,"  Why is everyone talking about ""The English Patient, it's so romantic"".  God, that movie stunk!",151
13314,ELAINE,  No you didn't.,151
13315,ELAINE," How about, it sucked?",151
13316,ELAINE,"  Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.",151
13317,JERRY, Stairmaster?,151
13318,JERRY, Nothin'.,151
13319,JERRY," Oh, did you get that outta my bag?",151
13320,JERRY," You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.",151
13321,JERRY," I could, but I choose not to.",151
13322,JERRY,  I..I didn't say that.,151
13323,JERRY,"  Actually, I am a comedian.",151
13324,JERRY,  Eighteen-fifties?,151
13325,JERRY,"  Mr Mandelbaum, I...",151
13326,JERRY,  Alright.,151
13327,JERRY, There. Alright?,151
13328,ELAINE,"  Okay, one for Sack Lunch.  It's good, right?  Yeah, good.",151
13329,ELAINE,"  Hey, what're you guys doing here?",151
13330,ELAINE, They make it longer?,151
13331,ELAINE,  Blaine!?,151
13332,ELAINE, I thought you were busy tonight.,151
13333,ELAINE, It's just a stupid movie.,151
13334,ELAINE,  I will!,151
13335,JERRY,  He egged me on.,151
13336,JERRY, He's eighty!,151
13337,JERRY,"  Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.",151
13338,JERRY," Ah, you must be Kramer's guys.  Come on in. You got the cigars?",151
13339,JERRY, Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.,151
13340,KRAMER," Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.",151
13341,JERRY,"  They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!",151
13342,KRAMER, I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?,151
13343,JERRY, Cigars!,151
13344,KRAMER," Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.",151
13345,JERRY,  You're making your own cigars now?,151
13346,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.",151
13347,JERRY,  Hold on a second.  Hiya dad.,151
13348,JERRY, They're Cuban cigar rollers.,151
13349,JERRY, What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?,151
13350,KRAMER, Hot and spicy.,151
13351,JERRY,"  You're not wearing a shirt, are you?",151
13352,KRAMER, Yes I am.,151
13353,JERRY, What colour is it?,151
13354,KRAMER, Damn!,151
13355,GEORGE," You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.",151
13356,GEORGE, Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?,151
13357,GEORGE,"  I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls.",151
13358,GEORGE,  I'll see you.,151
13359,ELAINE," Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me.  All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.",151
13360,ELAINE," Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it?  Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!",151
13361,ELAINE,"  Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello?  You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!",151
13362,JERRY, This is quite a condo.,151
13363,JERRY, The crepe place?,151
13364,JERRY,  There's crepe money?,151
13365,JERRY,"  Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.",151
13366,JERRY, What?,151
13367,JERRY," Mr Mandelbaum, please.",151
13368,JERRY, I think I saw one a coupla doors down.,151
13369,JERRY,"  So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!",151
13370,GEORGE,  Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.,151
13371,JERRY,"  George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.",151
13372,GEORGE,"  So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?",151
13373,JERRY," I don't know, but you better keep it up.",151
13374,GEORGE, I'm gonna go meet Danielle.  There's a new Neil in town!  Hahaha!,151
13375,JERRY,"  I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles.  Hello.",151
13376,JERRY," I will, I just walked in the door.",151
13377,JERRY, Ma.,151
13378,KRAMER," Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station.  What's going on!?",151
13379,JERRY, What?,151
13380,KRAMER,  They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans.,151
13381,JERRY, So?,151
13382,KRAMER," So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.",151
13383,JERRY, What's the difference?,151
13384,KRAMER," Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.",151
13385,JERRY,"  We're talking about people, right?",151
13386,KRAMER," Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.",151
13387,JERRY, I thought they smelled pretty nice.,151
13388,KRAMER," Jerry, your palate's unrefined.",151
13389,JERRY, Is not.,151
13390,KRAMER, Is too.,151
13391,JERRY, Is not.,151
13392,KRAMER, Is too.,151
13393,JERRY, I'm not having this conversation.,151
13394,KRAMER, Are too.,151
13395,JERRY, Am not.,151
13396,KRAMER, Are too.,151
13397,JERRY, Am not.,151
13398,KRAMER, Are too.,151
13399,ELAINE,"  Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.",151
13400,ELAINE,  No.,151
13401,JERRY," Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.",151
13402,JERRY,  That's very nice.,151
13403,JERRY," Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.",151
13404,JERRY,  This is your son?,151
13405,JERRY,  You got any kids?,151
13406,JERRY,"  Look, no-one is lifting anything.",151
13407,JERRY,  Oh no.,151
13408,JERRY,  We're already in a hospital.,151
13409,KRAMER,"  Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.",151
13410,KRAMER, They're right out here.,151
13411,KRAMER," Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.",151
13412,KRAMER,"  Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.",151
13413,KRAMER,  I think so.,151
13414,KRAMER," Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother...  ...Dennis.",151
13415,KRAMER," Uh, Dwayne.",151
13416,KRAMER,  What!?,151
13417,GEORGE,  Really?,151
13418,GEORGE,"  Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.",151
13419,GEORGE,  Coffee?  I can beat that. Move in with me.,151
13420,GEORGE,  Beats the hell out of coffee.,151
13421,ELAINE,  Yuh.,151

13715,GEORGE, Yada yada yada...,153
13716,KRAMER," Well, you too seem to have the same taste.",153
13717,KRAMER, Well I have the same shirt.,153
13718,KRAMER, Oh. ,153
13719,KRAMER, I live for Merlot.,153
13720,ELAINE," Oh, yeah, yeah.",153
13721,ELAINE," Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.",153
13722,ELAINE," Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, ""Would you SHUT UP?!"" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. ",153
13723,GEORGE," Oh, you're in here.",153
13724,JERRY, What're you doing here?,153
13725,GEORGE, I knew you had an appointment.,153
13726,JERRY, Well this is very awkward.,153
13727,GEORGE," I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. ",153
13728,JERRY," Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.",153
13729,GEORGE," Hey, what this thing? Whew!",153
13730,JERRY," All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. ",153
13731,GEORGE," Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?",153
13732,JERRY, George...,153
13733,GEORGE," Fine, I'll make an appointment. ",153
13734,JERRY, Hey.,153
13735,JERRY," Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?",153
13736,JERRY," I know, but...",153
13737,JERRY, 5000.,153
13738,JERRY, And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.,153
13739,ELAINE, Why are you so concerned about this?,153
13740,JERRY, I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. ,153
13741,JERRY, Yes. ,153
13742,KRAMER, I don't believe that.,153
13743,KRAMER, Why were you holding the door open for?,153
13744,KRAMER," Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!",153
13745,KRAMER," I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?",153
13746,KRAMER," Oh, everybody's your type.",153
13747,KRAMER, You've been married three times.,153
13748,JERRY," All right, take it easy.",153
13749,ELAINE," Hey, hey, hey!",153
13750,KRAMER," Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!",153
13751,ELAINE," Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.",153
13752,KRAMER," All right, so we let the girls decide.",153
13753,KRAMER," Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.",153
13754,KRAMER," That's right, 'cause they already saw it.",153
13755,GEORGE," Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.",153
13756,GEORGE, Yada.,153
13757,ELAINE," Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?",153
13758,ELAINE, Really.,153
13759,ELAINE, Oh.,153
13760,ELAINE," Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.",153
13761,JERRY, How you doing?,153
13762,JERRY, Whatley. ,153
13763,KRAMER, What are they doing here?,153
13764,KRAMER," All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?",153
13765,KRAMER," All right, I'll take Julie.",153
13766,KRAMER," All right, I'll take Karen.",153
13767,KRAMER," All right, which one is Julie?  Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. ",153
13768,JERRY," So Whatley sayd to me, ""Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic.""",153
13769,ELAINE," You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys.  Bouys!",153
13770,JERRY," Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.",153
13771,ELAINE, So what're you gonna do?,153
13772,JERRY, I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.,153
13773,ELAINE,"  Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.",153
13774,JERRY, They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?,153
13775,ELAINE, Thought it would be nice.,153
13776,JERRY, Poor Beth.,153
13777,ELAINE," Hey, Arnie's just as upset.",153
13778,JERRY, Oh screw him! ,153
13779,GEORGE," Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and ""yada yada yada, I'm really tired today."" You don't think she yada yada'd sex.",153
13780,ELAINE,  I've yada yada'd sex.,153
13781,GEORGE, Really?,153
13782,ELAINE," Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.",153
13783,JERRY, But you yada yada'd over the best part.,153
13784,ELAINE," No, I mentioned the bisk.",153
13785,GEORGE," Well, I gotta do somethin'. ",153
13786,KRAMER," Well, I gotta do somethin'.",153
13787,JERRY, George is already in there.,153
13788,KRAMER,"  No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.",153
13789,JERRY, I thought you were leaning towards Julie.,153
13790,KRAMER," I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.",153
13791,GEORGE, Well it was a helluva yada yada.,153
13792,GEORGE," All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.",153
13793,GEORGE, Tell me about the free facial.,153
13794,GEORGE, Which one?,153
13795,GEORGE, Very good. Go on.,153
13796,GEORGE, What's that?,153
13797,GEORGE, Shoplifting.,153
13798,JERRY," Excuse me, Mother?",153
13799,JERRY," Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?",153
13800,JERRY," Hmm, I really need to speak with him.",153
13801,JERRY, Oh. ,153
13802,JERRY, Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.,153
13803,JERRY," Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.",153
13804,JERRY," No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.",153
13805,JERRY," And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.",153
13806,JERRY," Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, ""Those aren't buoys.""  Father...",153
13807,JERRY, You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?,153
13808,JERRY, Newer magazines.,153
13809,GEORGE," Jerry, I gotta talk to you.",153
13810,KRAMER, Hi.,153
13811,KRAMER, Got a minute?,153
13812,KRAMER, Sure.,153
13813,KRAMER, Hi.,153
13814,ELAINE," Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....",153
13815,ELAINE, Again you are telling me to shut up?,153
13816,ELAINE, You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.,153
13817,ELAINE," Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.",153
13818,ELAINE," See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.",153
13819,JERRY,"  Oh, are you about done?",153
13820,JERRY, Huh?,153
13821,JERRY, What about all your Jewish jokes?,153
13822,JERRY, The Jews?,153
13823,JERRY, Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?,153
13824,KRAMER," So, I'll uh... all right. ",153
13825,JERRY, Date with Karen?,153
13826,KRAMER," No, Julie. She's the one.",153
13827,JERRY, What happened to Karen?,153
13828,KRAMER," Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?",153
13829,JERRY," Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?",153
13830,KRAMER," Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.",153
13831,JERRY, So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.,153
13832,KRAMER," Those people, listen to yourself.",153
13833,JERRY, What?,153
13834,KRAMER," You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.",153
13835,JERRY," Kramer, he's just a dentist.",153
13836,KRAMER," Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.",153
13837,JERRY, I am not an anti-dentite!,153
13838,KRAMER," You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. ""Hey, denty!"" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.",153
13839,JERRY, They do have their own schools!,153
13840,KRAMER, Yeah!,153
13841,ELAINE," One little baby, whatever you have in stock.",153
13842,ELAINE," Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.",153
13843,JERRY," Well, what's wrong?",153
13844,JERRY, Talk to me.,153
13845,JERRY," Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.",153
13846,JERRY, Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.,153
13847,JERRY," Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. ",153
13848,JERRY, I'm kinda in the middle of something.,153
13849,JERRY," Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.",153
13850,ELAINE, Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?,153
13851,JERRY, Beth and Arnie broke up.,153
13852,ELAINE, So they don't want a baby?,153
13853,JERRY,  Pff.,153
13854,ELAINE,  I think I'm gonna be sick. ,153
13855,JERRY," Hey, where's Marcy?",153

13861,JERRY, Very handsome.,153
13862,KRAMER,  How ya doing?,153
13863,JERRY," Hi, Mr. Abbott.",153
13864,JERRY," Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.",153
13865,JERRY, What?,153
13866,JERRY, That's a good one. Dentists.,153
13867,ELAINE, Where's Beth?,153
13868,JERRY, She went out to get her head shaved.,153
13869,JERRY, Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.,153
13870,ELAINE," Uh, excuse me.",154
13871,ELAINE," Uhm, I just have a question.",154
13872,ELAINE,  Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.,154
13873,ELAINE,  HEY!!,154
13874,ELAINE,"  Nothing. You, just lost a customer.",154
13875,JERRY," Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up. Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.",154
13876,JERRY," Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.",154
13877,GEORGE, So you're on the speed dial?,154
13878,JERRY, After two dates!,154
13879,GEORGE, What number?,154
13880,JERRY, Seven.,154
13881,GEORGE," Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen.",154
13882,KRAMER," Uh, hey buddy.",154
13883,JERRY, Hey.,154
13884,KRAMER, It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.,154
13885,JERRY, You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!,154
13886,KRAMER," No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.",154
13887,JERRY," Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!",154
13888,KRAMER, You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.,154
13889,GEORGE," Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.",154
13890,JERRY, What for?,154
13891,GEORGE,"  I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.",154
13892,JERRY," Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?",154
13893,GEORGE,  I have no idea.,154
13894,ELAINE," Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.",154
13895,JERRY, I don't mind the Mayans.,154
13896,ELAINE,"  You know that store, Putumayo?  I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.",154
13897,KRAMER," What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.",154
13898,ELAINE," No, no, not Putumayo.",154

13903,JERRY," Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!",154

13906,GEORGE,  I'm still here.,154

13916,GEORGE, ...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.,154
13917,JERRY, Good meeting?,154
13918,GEORGE," There was no meeting.  But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.",154
13919,JERRY, You can do that.,154
13920,GEORGE," Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'",154
13921,JERRY, So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?,154
13922,GEORGE, Ehh.  Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?,154
13923,KRAMER, You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?,154
13924,JERRY," So, George...",154

13929,GEORGE," What, she's ranking you?",154
13930,JERRY," Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer.",154
13931,GEORGE, What is a barometer exactly?,154
13932,KRAMER, It's pronounced thermometer.,154
13933,KRAMER," You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup  getting a call here.",154
13934,KRAMER,"  Hey, it's Newman.  Hey, how you doing, Newman?",154

13942,GEORGE," Huh, strawberries, anyone?  Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.",154
13943,GEORGE, Gotta get the good ones.,154
13944,GEORGE," Oh, that's bad. That's bad.",154
13945,KRAMER," So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?",154
13946,JERRY, Some of us.,154
13947,KRAMER,  I don't wanna exclude anybody.,154
13948,JERRY, Hola.,154
13949,ELAINE, Shove it!,154
13950,JERRY, What is all this?,154

13963,JERRY," You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.",154
13964,JERRY," But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.",154
13965,JERRY, What? No.,154
13966,JERRY, Yikes!,154
13967,KRAMER," Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.",154
13968,KRAMER,"  You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!",154
13969,KRAMER," Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.",154
13970,KRAMER,"  Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.",154
13971,KRAMER, Cubed.,154
13972,KRAMER, I gotta invite Jerry. He's my buddy.,154
13973,JERRY, How could they not fire you?,154

13975,JERRY," Aw, come on there now.",154
13976,GEORGE,  Feel like I can't do anything wrong.,154
13977,JERRY, Nonsense. You do everything wrong.,154
13978,GEORGE,  Everything?,154
13979,JERRY, Everything.,154
13980,GEORGE, You really think so?,154
13981,JERRY, Absolutely. I have no confidence in you.,154
13982,GEORGE," Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!",154
13983,JERRY, That's the spirit. You suck!,154
13984,GEORGE,  I know.,154
13985,ELAINE," No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.",154
13986,ELAINE,  You? What're you doing here?,154
13987,ELAINE, No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. ,154
13988,ELAINE," Ah, this really sticks in my craw.",154
13989,JERRY," Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?",154
13990,JERRY, Okay.,154
13991,JERRY," Uh, good.",154
13992,JERRY,  What?,154
13993,JERRY," I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...",154
13994,JERRY," Valerie's not coming over, is she?",154
13995,JERRY, No...,154
13996,JERRY," Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?",154
13997,JERRY,  Wuhh...,154
13998,KRAMER, Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand...,154
13999,KRAMER,  Newmanniun!!,154
14000,KRAMER,  Jerry?,154
14001,JERRY," Oh my God, George!",154
14002,JERRY," Kramer, look, it's George.",154
14003,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, I know.  Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.",154
14004,JERRY,  Fine.,154
14005,KRAMER,"  I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!",154
14006,JERRY,  No problem.,154
14007,KRAMER,"  You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.",154
14008,KRAMER,"  Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.",154
14009,ELAINE,  Okay.,154
14010,KRAMER," No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.",154
14011,ELAINE,  Fine.,154
14012,KRAMER,  Oh come on!!,154
14013,ELAINE,  Alright.,154
14014,KRAMER,"  Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh.  Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.",154
14015,ELAINE,"  Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?",154
14016,KRAMER, Yeah.,154
14017,ELAINE," Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.",154
14018,KRAMER, Can do.,154
14019,JERRY, What're you doing with a pricing-gun?,154
14020,ELAINE, That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.,154
14021,JERRY,  Still a rip-off.,154
14022,JERRY, Hello?,154
14023,JERRY," Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.",154
14024,JERRY, Hold on a second.,154
14025,JERRY, Hello?,154
14026,JERRY," Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.",154
14027,JERRY, Hello?,154
14028,JERRY, Well...,154
14029,JERRY, Hang on.,154
14030,JERRY," She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.",154
14031,JERRY, Hang on.,154
14032,JERRY, She wants to be back on yours.,154
14033,JERRY, Hang on.,154
14034,JERRY," Fine, if I'm off yours.",154
14035,JERRY, Sorry. Hang on.,154
14036,JERRY," Fine, if I'm off yours.",154
14037,JERRY," Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.",154
14038,JERRY,"  Great, bye.",154
14039,JERRY, She said she'll do it.,154
14040,JERRY, Hang on.,154
14041,JERRY, Hello?,154
14042,GEORGE, Jerry. I can't get fired.,154
14043,KRAMER," Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty.",154
14044,KRAMER," Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.",154
14045,KRAMER,"  Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?",154
14046,KRAMER, Hmm-mmm.,154
14047,KRAMER," Oh, not a problem.",154
14048,GEORGE," Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.",154
14049,KRAMER, L'Occupado.,154
14050,ELAINE," Come on, what is taking you so long?",154
14051,KRAMER," Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.",154
14052,ELAINE, Plan B? There is no plan B.,154
14053,KRAMER,  I took these out of every single garment in the store.,154
14054,ELAINE, What?!,154
14055,KRAMER," They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture.  These clothes won't last five years without 'em.",154
14056,ELAINE, That's not gonna do anything.,154
14057,KRAMER, Patience.,154
14058,ELAINE, Alright. Forget it!,154
14059,KRAMER, What?,154
14060,ELAINE," You have screwed me again, Pennypacker!",154
14061,KRAMER,"  Well, I don't mind if I do.",154
14062,KRAMER," Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.",154
14063,GEORGE,"  He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!",154
14064,GEORGE," Mr Wilhelm, what was that?!",154
14065,KRAMER," I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.",154
14066,JERRY, She never sees the big picture.,154
14067,JERRY," Hello, Newman!",154
14068,KRAMER," Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.",154
14069,KRAMER," Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.",154
14070,KRAMER," Jerry too, of course.",154
14071,JERRY, No.,154
14072,KRAMER, Deal?,154
14073,KRAMER,  To the Kramennium.,154
14074,JERRY," By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?",154
14075,JERRY," Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.",154
14076,JERRY, Aww!,154
14077,JERRY, Hello?,154
14078,JERRY, It's Jerry. Who's this?,154
14079,JERRY," Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?",154
14080,JERRY," Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!",154
14081,JERRY, Hello?,154
14082,JERRY, Hang on just let me pick up a paper.,155
14083,GEORGE, Yeah. No problem.,155
14084,JERRY, Let's go.,155
14085,GEORGE," Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag.",155
14086,JERRY, For how long?,155
14087,GEORGE, I'm sure he'll be back in a second.,155
14088,JERRY, Come on.,155
14089,GEORGE, Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?,155
14090,GEORGE, Where are you going?,155
14091,JERRY, I'm going to be this guy's friend.,155
14092,JERRY, New clothes?,155
14093,GEORGE, Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping.  Can I borrow your menu?,155
14094,JERRY," Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!",155
14095,GEORGE, The guy never came back.,155
14096,JERRY, He asked you to watch them not wear them.,155
14097,GEORGE, I'm still watching them.,155
14098,JERRY, You look like a tourist.,155
14099,GEORGE," All right, let me ask you something",155
14100,JERRY, When you hear like a soft russeling.,155
14101,GEORGE," It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this",155
14102,JERRY," Oh right, the new job, how is it?",155
14103,GEORGE," I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.",155
14104,JERRY, So who's the new you?,155
14105,GEORGE, They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.,155
14106,JERRY, Oh hi Alex.,155
14107,JERRY, No.,155
14108,GEORGE, Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?,155
14109,JERRY," Right here, George. In here.  Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.",155
14110,GEORGE, Thanks. Thanks a lot.,155
14111,KRAMER, Hey.,155
14112,ELAINE, Hey.,155
14113,KRAMER, Hi.,155
14114,ELAINE, Where's Jerry?,155
14115,KRAMER, Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?,155
14116,ELAINE, No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.,155
14117,KRAMER, Well let's sit down.,155
14118,ELAINE," Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?",155
14119,KRAMER, Vaguely.,155
14120,ELAINE," Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.",155
14121,KRAMER, You put my life's stories in his autobiography?,155
14122,ELAINE," Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.",155
14123,KRAMER," Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.",155
14124,ELAINE, He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.,155
14125,KRAMER, Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh.,155
14126,KRAMER," He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks.",155
14127,JERRY,  Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.,155
14128,KRAMER," All right, let's go.",155
14129,ELAINE," Mr. Lippman, how are you?",155
14130,ELAINE, What are you doing here?,155
14131,ELAINE, Oh.,155
14132,KRAMER, Hey buddy. Remember me?,155
14133,KRAMER," Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?",155
14134,KRAMER, I'm the real Peterman.,155
14135,KRAMER, Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.,155
14136,ELAINE, That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.,155
14137,ELAINE," Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of  does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.",155
14138,KRAMER, I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.,155
14139,GEORGE, Well actually I'm...,155
14140,GEORGE," Little Rock, Arkensas.",155
14141,JERRY, Hmm. That looks new.,155
14142,KRAMER, So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.,155
14143,JERRY,  Yeah that's too bad.,155
14144,KRAMER, What's the matter with you?,155
14145,JERRY,  Nothing.,155
14146,KRAMER," No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.",155
14147,JERRY, I did something stupid.,155
14148,KRAMER, What did you do?,155
14149,JERRY," Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew,  Gone.",155
14150,KRAMER, Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.,155
14151,JERRY, Well women do it.,155
14152,KRAMER,"  ""Well women do it."" I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just  sashey your pretty little self around the town square.",155
14153,JERRY, Well what am I going to tell Alex?,155
14154,KRAMER, Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?,155
14155,JERRY, Um hum.,155
14156,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry shaved his chest.",155
14157,JERRY, Hey!,155
14158,KRAMER, I forgot. Wait. Never mind.,155
14159,JERRY, You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...,155
14160,JERRY, Really?,155
14161,ELAINE," ""Top of the Muffin to you!""?",155
14162,ELAINE, Mr Lippman?,155
14163,JERRY, So you're pretending to be a tourist?,155
14164,GEORGE," It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup",155
14165,JERRY, How do you explain your apartment?,155
14166,GEORGE, I got a hotel room.,155
14167,JERRY, you moved into a hotel?,155
14168,GEORGE, Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?,155
14169,JERRY, So get this,155
14170,GEORGE, So?,155
14171,JERRY, So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.,155
14172,GEORGE, Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?,155
14173,JERRY, Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.,155
14174,KRAMER,  Hey Jerry.,155
14175,KRAMER,  I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.,155
14176,GEORGE, Reality tour?,155
14177,JERRY, The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.,155
14178,ELAINE, This was my idea you stole my idea.,155
14179,ELAINE, Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.,155
14180,ELAINE, Peach.,155
14181,GEORGE, Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.,155
14182,GEORGE, Willie. Yeah.,155
14183,GEORGE, Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?,155
14184,JERRY, You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.,155
14185,GEORGE," Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.",155
14186,JERRY, What is it she think you can't do?,155
14187,GEORGE, Find a job. Get an apartment.,155
14188,JERRY, How did you do those things?,155
14189,GEORGE," Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.",155
14190,JERRY," Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?",155
14191,KRAMER," Here you go, here you go, check it out.",155
14192,JERRY," ""The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour"". I'm confused.",155
14193,KRAMER, Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.,155
14194,JERRY, Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.,155
14195,KRAMER," I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.",155
14196,GEORGE, What's desert?,155
14197,KRAMER, Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.,155
14198,GEORGE, He eats those?,155
14199,KRAMER, No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.,155
14200,GEORGE," I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.",155
14201,KRAMER, Talk to me.,155
14202,GEORGE," But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.",155
14203,KRAMER, Understand?,155
14204,JERRY, Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.,155
14205,ELAINE, So? What do you want me to do about it?,155
14206,ELAINE," Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...",155
14207,ELAINE," Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.",155
14208,ELAINE, Yeah.,155
14209,ELAINE," I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.",155
14210,ELAINE," And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not ""Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*""",155
14211,KRAMER, Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?,155
14212,JERRY, What? Can't I get a moment's peace?,155
14213,KRAMER, What are you doing to yourself?,155
14214,JERRY, I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.,155
14215,KRAMER," You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.",155
14216,JERRY, Oh that's an old wives tale.,155
14217,KRAMER, Is it? Look at this.,155
14218,KRAMER,  Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.,155
14219,JERRY, Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.,155
14220,KRAMER, Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?,155
14221,ELAINE, Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.,155
14222,ELAINE," Oh, hi.",155
14223,ELAINE, You been enjoying them?,155
14224,ELAINE, Well they're perfectly edible.,155
14225,ELAINE, If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.,155
14226,ELAINE, Fine.,155
14227,ELAINE, We were just trying to help.,155
14228,ELAINE, I think I might.,155
14229,GEORGE, $2300.,155
14230,GEORGE, Yeah.,155
14231,GEORGE," Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.",155
14232,KRAMER," Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.",155
14233,KRAMER,  Well that's your opinion.,155
14234,KRAMER, Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.,155
14235,KRAMER," Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.",155
14236,JERRY, Why do I have to go on the tour?,155
14237,KRAMER," Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.",155
14238,JERRY," Hey, how's business?",155
14239,ELAINE," Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.",155
14240,KRAMER," All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.",155
14241,ELAINE," Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?",155
14242,KRAMER, Yeah.,155
14243,ELAINE, You got any room on that thing?,155
14244,KRAMER, Yeah there are a few seats still available.,155
14245,ELAINE, Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.,155
14246,KRAMER," Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.",155
14247,ELAINE, No they don't.,155
14248,KRAMER, Are they war veterans?,155
14249,GEORGE, Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... ,155
14250,GEORGE, Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.,155
14251,JERRY, You also shouldn't use a donut.,155
14252,KRAMER, All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...,155
14253,JERRY, Can we just go?,155
14254,KRAMER, And go we will.,155
14255,KRAMER, We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.,155
14256,KRAMER, And we're off.,155
14257,JERRY," You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.",155
14258,KRAMER, I was going to dump this.,155
14259,KRAMER, Well it's muffin stumps,155
14260,KRAMER, This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.,155
14261,KRAMER, Is this a joke?,155
14262,JERRY, What's that?,155
14263,JERRY, Oh. Yeah.,155
14264,KRAMER,  Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.,155
14265,KRAMER,"  I don't know.  Uh, no more questions.",155
14266,GEORGE," Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.",155
14267,GEORGE, What clothes?,155
14268,JERRY,  Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.,155
14269,KRAMER, Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.,155
14270,JERRY," I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.",155
14271,JERRY, I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.,155
14272,KRAMER, I don't know where the tops are.,155
14273,KRAMER, Jerry what's the matter?,155
14274,JERRY,"  Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.",155
14275,GEORGE,  Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.,155
14276,ELAINE, They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.,155
14277,ELAINE, In the back.,155
14278,JERRY," Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.",156
14279,GEORGE, I got to give the players most of the credit for that.,156
14280,JERRY," Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.",156
14281,GEORGE," No, I don't know who was doing that.",156
14282,JERRY," So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?",156
14283,GEORGE, They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.,156
14284,JERRY, Maybe I should ask her out?,156
14285,GEORGE, She is a good waitress.,156
14286,JERRY, That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.,156
14287,GEORGE, You're going to the Tony's?,156
14288,JERRY," Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.",156
14289,GEORGE, Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?',156
14290,JERRY, They're musicians. That's not a joke.,156
14291,GEORGE, It's a funny observation.,156
14292,GEORGE, Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.,156
14293,JERRY, They did it for three years. What's another few months.,156
14294,GEORGE, I'm really going to do something with these three months.,156
14295,JERRY, Like what?,156
14296,GEORGE, I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.,156
14297,JERRY, I've always wanted to do that...,156
14298,GEORGE, I'm gonna play frolf.,156
14299,JERRY, You mean golf?,156
14300,GEORGE," Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this",156
14301,ELAINE, ...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.,156
14302,ELAINE, Who's that?,156
14303,ELAINE, Better call the zoo.,156
14304,ELAINE, What?,156
14305,ELAINE, It's like she's carrying invisible suitcases.,156
14306,JERRY, Like this? ,156
14307,ELAINE," Yes, exactly.",156
14308,JERRY, That's so strange.,156
14309,ELAINE, Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.,156
14310,JERRY," Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?",156
14311,ELAINE, That is so stupid.,156
14312,JERRY, Reer.,156
14313,GEORGE," Hey, 'The White Shadow' is on...",156
14314,JERRY," Boy, your really packing it all in.",156
14315,GEORGE," Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today.",156
14316,JERRY, Like what?,156
14317,GEORGE, I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.,156
14318,KRAMER," Hey Jerry, you got any Tums?",156
14319,JERRY, Stomach ache?,156
14320,KRAMER, I drank too much water in the shower.,156
14321,JERRY," Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.",156
14322,GEORGE, Shadow!,156
14323,KRAMER," Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy.",156
14324,ELAINE, You're going to the Tony's too?,156
14325,KRAMER, Roger that.,156
14326,JERRY, Where are you sitting?,156
14327,KRAMER," Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.",156
14328,ELAINE, How did you get that job?,156
14329,KRAMER," Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.",156
14330,JERRY, What academy?,156
14331,KRAMER," Well, he didn't say .",156
14332,JERRY, Hi!,156
14333,JERRY," Thanks, it's a breakaway.",156
14334,JERRY, Absolutely.,156
14335,JERRY, Ok...,156
14336,JERRY," Thanks, Lyle...",156
14337,KRAMER, Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered.,156
14338,KRAMER, I'll just squeeze in...,156
14339,KRAMER, My job. What are you doing?,156
14340,KRAMER," You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.",156
14341,JERRY," So, you and Lyle are roommates?",156
14342,JERRY, Gay?,156
14343,JERRY, Is he gay?,156
14344,JERRY, Are you sure?,156
14345,JERRY,  This is a new one.,156
14346,KRAMER,  Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me.,156
14347,GEORGE, Kramer?,156
14348,ELAINE," Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk.",156
14349,ELAINE," You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.",156
14350,ELAINE," No no no no, it's just...",156
14351,GEORGE, She had a dude?,156
14352,JERRY," Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.",156
14353,GEORGE, How do you know it was her dude?,156
14354,JERRY, What do you think it could've been just some dude?,156
14355,GEORGE," Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.",156
14356,JERRY, I reckon.,156
14357,GEORGE," Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude.",156
14358,JERRY, Dude!,156
14359,GEORGE," All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap.",156
14360,JERRY, It's 10,156
14361,GEORGE, I tell you; I'm wiped.,156
14362,JERRY," So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?",156
14363,GEORGE, De-compressing.,156
14364,KRAMER," Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you.",156
14365,JERRY, You didn't give that thing back?,156
14366,KRAMER," Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win.",156
14367,JERRY, That's because you didn't win.,156
14368,GEORGE, 'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder.,156
14369,KRAMER, Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch!,156
14370,JERRY, You haven't even seen it.,156
14371,KRAMER," Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's!",156
14372,GEORGE," What, Minelli's!?!",156
14373,KRAMER, No.,156
14374,ELAINE," Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day.",156
14375,ELAINE," See, yeah, that's all I was saying.",156
14376,ELAINE," Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...",156
14377,JERRY, Hi!,156
14378,JERRY, No rush.,156
14379,JERRY,  I have absolutely no idea.,156
14380,JERRY, ..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!,156
14381,GEORGE, Who's that?,156
14382,JERRY, It's Kramer.,156
14383,GEORGE, Hey Kramer.,156
14384,JERRY, George says hi.,156
14385,KRAMER,  Hi George!,156
14386,GEORGE, How's that Tony?,156
14387,JERRY, Why don't you just come over?,156
14388,GEORGE, Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now?,156
14389,JERRY, He's looking on to fridgerator.,156
14390,GEORGE, Kramer. Anything good in there? Any Popsicles?,156
14391,JERRY, I can't do this.,156
14392,KRAMER," So, what's George doing?",156
14393,JERRY, He's not doing anything. Goodbye!,156
14394,KRAMER," So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?",156
14395,JERRY, Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?,156
14396,KRAMER, The Tony is taking me to Sardi's.,156
14397,JERRY," Oh, hello.",156
14398,KRAMER, I'm going.,156
14399,KRAMER," Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone...",156
14400,JERRY," All right, all right.",156
14401,JERRY, I said no! ,156
14402,JERRY, Just me? No dudes or fellas?,156
14403,JERRY, I can start right away.,156
14404,JERRY, But not here. ,156
14405,GEORGE,"  Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone.",156
14406,KRAMER, ...so I said to him,156
14407,KRAMER," Hey, eh, Lew!",156
14408,ELAINE, This. My office. Sam trashed my office.,156
14409,ELAINE," Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.",156
14410,ELAINE," Do you mean ""reer?""",156
14411,ELAINE," Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy!  Crazy for feelings...",156
14412,JERRY, I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.,156
14413,JERRY," Eh, what?",156
14414,JERRY," Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that.",156
14415,JERRY, Sure.,156
14416,JERRY, The one with the...,156
14417,JERRY," Ok, ok...",156
14418,JERRY," No, I'll crab it.",156
14419,GEORGE," Hey, I've done that today.",156
14420,JERRY," What, did you lose your remote?",156
14421,GEORGE," Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead.",156
14422,JERRY, It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.,156
14423,GEORGE,"  Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?",156
14424,JERRY, Not.,156
14425,GEORGE," No, no...",156
14426,JERRY," No, because that's...",156
14427,GEORGE," No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?",156
14428,JERRY, Here.,156
14429,GEORGE, Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.,156
14430,JERRY, I'm trying.,156
14431,GEORGE," I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.",156
14432,JERRY, Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!,156
14433,KRAMER, No.,156
14434,KRAMER, Anything...,156
14435,KRAMER," Oh yeah, she's fantastic....",156
14436,KRAMER," So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?",156
14437,JERRY, Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?,156
14438,KRAMER," Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true.",156
14439,JERRY, She seems very nice.,156
14440,KRAMER," Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.",156
14441,JERRY, I'm in show business.,156
14442,KRAMER," Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.",156
14443,JERRY, I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.,156
14444,KRAMER, Yayaya...,156
14445,ELAINE," Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.",156
14446,ELAINE, She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.,156
14447,JERRY, Did you tell Peterman about this?,156
14448,ELAINE," Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.",156
14449,KRAMER, Cat fight?,156
14450,ELAINE," Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?",156
14451,KRAMER, Yeye cat fight!,156
14452,JERRY, Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.,156
14453,KRAMER, T-t-t-t...,156
14454,JERRY, You got the tickets?,156
14455,GEORGE," Yeah, two for the 7",156
14456,JERRY, I like it.,156
14457,GEORGE," She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. ",156
14458,JERRY, What?,156
14459,GEORGE," Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey... Go get'em you're a tiger!",156
14460,JERRY," Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.",156
14461,GEORGE, A little notice would've helped! How many people?,156
14462,JERRY," 35, and George, on the invitations...",156
14463,GEORGE," I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...",156
14464,JERRY," I like your nails, that is a great color.",156
14465,JERRY, This old thing?,156
14466,GEORGE," Hi, I need some party invitations.",156
14467,GEORGE, About a year ago. Wedding invitations.,156
14468,GEORGE, No complaints.,156
14469,GEORGE," Actually,  I'll take these nice glossy ones.",156
14470,KRAMER, Ms. Welch.,156
14471,KRAMER," Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers.",156
14472,KRAMER," Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.",156
14473,KRAMER," Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...",156
14474,KRAMER," Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...",156
14475,GEORGE," Hey, frolf?",156
14476,GEORGE," Yeah, sure.",156
14477,JERRY," Ok, let's towel it up.",156
14478,JERRY, But we're in towels.,156
14479,JERRY, all right. One second.,156
14480,GEORGE," He frolfs, he scores...",156
14481,GEORGE, Hello.,156
14482,JERRY," George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!",156
14483,JERRY, No.  Did you at least pick them up?,156
14484,GEORGE," Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.",156
14485,JERRY," Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.",156
14486,GEORGE," All right, All right, keep your towel on.",156
14487,JERRY,...what?,156
14488,GEORGE, It's a joke.,156
14489,JERRY," All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!",156
14490,ELAINE, Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!,156
14491,ELAINE," Look, just because I'm a woman...",156
14492,ELAINE," Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks.",156
14493,ELAINE, Like this...,156
14494,ELAINE, Aren't you Raquel Welch?,156
14495,ELAINE," Nothing, I wasn't just moving my arms...",156
14496,KRAMER, So how's George?,156
14497,JERRY, I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? ,156
14498,KRAMER, Tony.,156
14499,JERRY, What happened to you?,156
14500,KRAMER, Raquel Welch!,156
14501,JERRY, Yikes.,156
14502,JERRY, What happened to you?,156
14503,ELAINE, Raquel Welch!,156
14504,KRAMER, The woman is a menace.,156
14505,ELAINE," Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.",156
14506,JERRY, Cat fight with Raquel Welch.,156
14507,KRAMER, Yey eye ca-catfight.,156
14508,ELAINE," My god, George!",156
14509,GEORGE, I slipped on the invitations...how's the towels?,156

14511,GEORGE, With the two of us?,156
14512,JERRY, I think we're still a man short.,156
14513,KRAMER," Well, that's good news.",156
14514,ELAINE," Wow, invitations again...",156
14515,KRAMER," Yeah, that's weird.",156
14516,ELAINE," All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?",156
14517,JERRY, Yeah...,156
14518,KRAMER, I'd like to get some coffee.,156
14519,GEORGE, This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer of George.,156
14520,GEORGE, Still a little summer left.,156
14521,GEORGE, I’ve had my difficulties.,158
14522,GEORGE," Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?",158
14523,GEORGE, How about the old Spider Man live action show?,158
14524,GEORGE, I don’t understand.,158
14525,GEORGE, Clearer,158
14526,JERRY, So you’re staying at Play Now?,158
14527,GEORGE," Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.",158
14528,JERRY," But they not you aren’t handicapped, aren’t you ashamed?",158
14529,GEORGE," They’re the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.",158
14530,ELAINE, Hey,158
14531,GEORGE, Hello-o-o-o Elaine!,158
14532,ELAINE, What’s that?,158
14533,JERRY," Oh, it’s just this stupid thing.",158
14534,ELAINE," Well, I’m sure it’s stupid. It’s not about me, is it?",158
14535,JERRY,  No-o-o-o.,158
14536,GEORGE,  Not at all.,158
14537,ELAINE, Tell me!,158

14539,ELAINE, Yeah.,158
14540,JERRY," Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.",158
14541,ELAINE, How is it talking?,158
14542,JERRY," Well, her belly button is like a mouth.  I’m bored. Talk to me.",158
14543,ELAINE," Oh I gotta start taking these ""stupid"" warnings more seriously.",158
14544,JERRY," Hey, look whose here - Puddy.",158
14545,ELAINE, My Puddy? But we broke up.,158
14546,JERRY, And yet he continues to live.,158
14547,ELAINE, I’m doing great.,158
14548,JERRY," Well, that’s it. You two are back together.",158
14549,ELAINE, What?,158
14550,JERRY, The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.,158
14551,ELAINE, David and I will not be getting back together.,158
14552,JERRY," Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You can’t do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.",158
14553,GEORGE, That’s beautiful.,158
14554,ELAINE," What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.",158
14555,JERRY," That’s different. I didn’t have feelings for those people. But you, you’ll backslide",158
14556,ELAINE, You want to bet?,158
14557,JERRY, Stakes?,158
14558,ELAINE, 50,158
14559,JERRY, Dollars?,158
14560,ELAINE, All right. Witness? .,158
14561,GEORGE, Witness.,158
14562,JERRY, Done.,158
14563,GEORGE, Percentage?,158
14564,JERRY, Yeah.,158
14565,JERRY," I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So… that’s it!",158
14566,JERRY," Oh yes, quite.",158
14567,KRAMER, Hello!,158
14568,JERRY, Of course it’s a sliding scale.,158
14569,JERRY,  La la la.,158
14570,KRAMER,  La la la.,158
14571,KRAMER," Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.",158
14572,JERRY," Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, that’s a good idea.",158
14573,KRAMER," Of course it’s a good idea, it’s my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.",158
14574,JERRY, Which part? The renovating the restaurant you don’t own part or spending the two hundred million you don’t have part?,158
14575,KRAMER," You see I come up with these things, I know they’re gold, but nothing happens. You know why?",158
14576,JERRY," No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.",158
14577,KRAMER,"  No, no…time! It’s all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?",158
14578,JERRY, I can ball park it.,158
14579,ELAINE,  Hello-o-o-o!,158
14580,KRAMER, Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!,158
14581,JERRY," Hey, I called you last night, where were you?",158
14582,ELAINE,  I went out with a  a friend.,158
14583,JERRY, George?,158
14584,ELAINE,"  No, no…no.",158
14585,JERRY," Well, I was here, that’s everyone .",158
14586,ELAINE, .,158
14587,JERRY, Are those the same shoes as yesterday?,158
14588,ELAINE," Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.",158
14589,JERRY," Your hair, it’s somewhat de-poofed.",158
14590,ELAINE, It’s the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?,158
14591,JERRY," Wait a second, what’s going on here?",158
14592,ELAINE," Nothing, nothing.",158
14593,JERRY, .,158
14594,ELAINE, .,158
14595,JERRY, You’re wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!!  You saw Puddy!,158
14596,KRAMER, Hoochie moochie. ,158
14597,JERRY, Hand it over. Pay up.,158
14598,ELAINE," No! It’s an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!",158
14599,JERRY, Then what do you call it? People don’t just bump into each other and have sex. This isn’t cinemax.,158
14600,ELAINE," It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.",158
14601,JERRY," Ah, dinner! That’s it, you’re all the way back!",158
14602,ELAINE, Ugh!,158
14603,JERRY," Sex, that’s meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; that’s heavy. That’s like an hour.",158
14604,KRAMER,"  Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun . That was my idea too!",158
14605,GEORGE, Good Morning!,158
14606,GEORGE," Hi Allison, that’s a nice dress.",158
14607,GEORGE, Hey Glenn!,158
14608,GEORGE, Heard that one already.,158
14609,KRAMER," …So that’s the bedroom. Here’s the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchen…Yeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.",158
14610,JERRY, And you are?,158
14611,KRAMER," Yeah, that’s Jerry, you don’t have to worry about him. Why don’t you go across the hall and get started on that mail.",158
14612,KRAMER, He’s a go getter!,158
14613,JERRY, Who’s he?,158
14614,KRAMER," My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.",158
14615,JERRY, Alright.,158
14616,KRAMER," Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.",158
14617,JERRY, But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.,158
14618,KRAMER," Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.",158
14619,JERRY," Alright, it’s time to go.",158
14620,KRAMER," Jerry, it’s not for people, it’s for oil tankers.",158
14621,JERRY,  I know!,158
14622,KRAMER," You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil won’t spill out.",158
14623,JERRY," Actually, that is not a bad idea.",158
14624,KRAMER,  yeah.,158
14625,JERRY," Now, it’s time to go.",158
14626,JERRY, Hello,158
14627,GEORGE,  Hello-o-o-o. .,158
14628,JERRY,"  Hello-o-o-o.  So, what’s going on?",158
14629,GEORGE," Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. They’ve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. I’m like Hitler’s last days here.",158
14630,JERRY," So, are you going to leave?",158
14631,GEORGE," Oh no! I’m vigilant. They’ll never get me out. I’m like a weed, Jerry.",158
14632,JERRY, I thought you’re like Hitler in the bunker?,158
14633,GEORGE, I’m a weed in Hitler’s bunker.,158
14634,JERRY," I’m getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff.  I’m getting another call, see ya… Hello!",158
14635,JERRY,  Really? When?,158
14636,JERRY," No, I don’t.",158
14637,KRAMER," Yeah, 5.",158
14638,ELAINE, Hey!,158
14639,JERRY," Hey! So, where’s my money?",158
14640,ELAINE," No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?",158
14641,JERRY," Oh yeah, hold on.",158
14642,JERRY," Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerry’s office. . We’re going to be three for lunch.  What do you mean he’s already left?",158
14643,JERRY," Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?",158
14644,KRAMER, What? When did this happen?,158
14645,JERRY," Well, just…",158
14646,KRAMER,  DARREN!,158
14647,ELAINE," I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddy’s. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. I’ll call.  Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. That’s funny. That’s really funny. That’s really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. .",158
14648,GEORGE," Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.",158
14649,JERRY, Do you have to write all this stuff down.,158
14650,JERRY," So, how hot did it get?",158
14651,GEORGE," I don’t know, 120, 130…Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.",158
14652,JERRY," I guess you can take anything, but actual work.",158
14653,GEORGE, Bring it on!,158
14654,GEORGE,  Hello-o-o-o Kramer!,158
14655,JERRY,  Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!,158
14656,GEORGE,  La la la.,158
14657,KRAMER," Sorry I couldn’t get out of there, what did I miss? ",158
14658,KRAMER, Uh huh…,158
14659,GEORGE,  And I still say he’s naked under there!,158
14660,JERRY, Oh that makes a lot of sense.,158
14661,GEORGE," Oh, shut up!",158
14662,JERRY, ,158
14663,JERRY," Oh, nothing. ",158
14664,JERRY," Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. We’ve been doing this silly, dumb voice.",158
14665,JERRY," No, it’s not you. It’s your stomach, he’s taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice.  Hello-o-o-o.",158
14666,JERRY, No it’s…,158
14667,JERRY," Hey, we’re kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?",158
14668,JERRY,  GET OUT!,158
14669,JERRY," No body said you’re fat. He’s a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.",158
14670,JERRY," No, he’s just a little bloated.",158
14671,JERRY, It’s mostly water weight.,158
14672,KRAMER," Boysenberry, the kid is still learning.",158
14673,KRAMER," Yeah, well nothing before noon.",158
14674,JERRY, Line two?,158
14675,KRAMER," Yeah, your phone is line one.",158
14676,JERRY, Oh…,158
14677,ELAINE," See, this is what Jerry’s doesn’t understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesn’t mean we are back together.",158
14678,ELAINE, Yeah.,158
14679,ELAINE," Well, either way…",158
14680,ELAINE, David…,158
14681,ELAINE, Alright that’s it! We’re back together!,158
14682,ELAINE," Oh, yeah.",158
14683,ELAINE, Get those clothes off. You’re going to spend the night and we’re going to cuddle.,158
14684,ELAINE, You heard me. Strip!,158
14685,GEORGE, ….….Alright……OK….,158
14686,GEORGE,"  Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? …Yes. If he needs me, tell him  I’M IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.",158
14687,KRAMER," Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?",158
14688,KRAMER, …Yeah.,158
14689,KRAMER," I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but it’s business as usual at Kramerica.",158
14690,KRAMER," And with Darren’s help, we’ll get that chicken.",158
14691,KRAMER," Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.",158
14692,JERRY, So you’re sure you’re not still angry about last night?,158
14693,JERRY, Never?,158
14694,JERRY, What about if you’re not around?,158
14695,JERRY, So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?,158
14696,JERRY, I can do that.,158
14697,JERRY, I don’t know.,158
14698,JERRY,  Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. ,158
14699,GEORGE, You broke up with her? Why?,158
14700,JERRY, So we could do the voice.  La-la-la. What’s the matter?,158
14701,GEORGE, I think I’m getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?,158
14702,JERRY," No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish.  Hola. Hello-o-o-o.",158
14703,GEORGE, I think I like the girl better than the voice.,158
14704,JERRY, Really?,158
14705,JERRY,  Hello-o-o-o.,158
14706,ELAINE, Still?,158
14707,GEORGE, I told you.,158
14708,ELAINE," Alright, here you go, choke on it .",158
14709,JERRY," See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.",158
14710,ELAINE," Yeah, well not for long. I’m breaking up with him.",158
14711,JERRY," No, I don’t think so. I’ve seen you two together. You make each other miserable. It’s kismet.",158
14712,ELAINE, Double or nothing.,158
14713,JERRY, Done.,158
14714,GEORGE,  Witness?,158
14715,JERRY, You’re in there again.,158
14716,GEORGE, I think Play Now is putting something in my food.,158
14717,ELAINE," Alright, I’m out of here.",158
14718,JERRY, What is this? .,158
14719,KRAMER, I don’t know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I haven’t been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. I’m clueless.  Is that clock right?,158
14720,JERRY, Yeah. Nine o’clock.,158
14721,KRAMER, I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.,158
14722,JERRY,  Good-bye Kramer.,158
14723,KRAMER," Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.",158
14724,JERRY, Really?,158
14725,KRAMER, So played.,158
14726,GEORGE, I told you.,158
14727,KRAMER, Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.,158
14728,KRAMER, Kramerica is no more.,158
14729,KRAMER," Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.",158
14730,KRAMER," Well, you’re still here?",158
14731,KRAMER," Well, I haven’t changed my mind.",158
14732,KRAMER," Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, I’ll do it. Kramerica industries lives! Let’s get back to work!",158
14733,KRAMER, Let’s see what Jerry has to eat.,158
14734,GEORGE," You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.",158
14735,GEORGE, Well played.,158
14736,JERRY,"  Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second.  So we definitely don’t want to do the voice anymore?  Alright, we’re back together again, great. Bye bye.",158
14737,KRAMER, Hey.,158
14738,JERRY, Trouble down at the plant?,158
14739,KRAMER, It’s a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.,158
14740,GEORGE, You have to drink that whole thing?,158
14741,KRAMER, No. No. No. It’s for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.,158
14742,JERRY, I understand .,158
14743,GEORGE, Would a giant rubber ball work?,158
14744,KRAMER, Conceivably.,158
14745,GEORGE," Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why don’t we test your bladder system at my office?",158
14746,JERRY, You’re not…,158
14747,GEORGE," Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, there’s nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.",158
14748,ELAINE," I don’t think so David, we’re through.",158
14749,ELAINE, Whew that was a dozy.,158
14750,JERRY, Go again?,158
14751,ELAINE, Book it.,158
14752,GEORGE,  Witness.,158
14753,ELAINE," David I know this hurts, but it’s the way it has to be .",158
14754,JERRY, Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.,158
14755,ELAINE, I’m going to get some popcorn.,158
14756,ELAINE," So, how did it end?",158
14757,JERRY, They got away.,158
14758,ELAINE, uh.,158
14759,ELAINE," Listen David, I’ve got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?",158
14760,JERRY, Hey.,158
14761,KRAMER, Did you bring the video camera?,158
14762,JERRY," Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, I’ll see ya.",158
14763,GEORGE," Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.",158
14764,JERRY, I can’t. I got to meet Clare.,158
14765,KRAMER, You gave up the voice?,158
14766,JERRY," Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.",158
14767,JERRY, Darren?,158
14768,JERRY," Uh, bathroom.",158
14769,GEORGE," Hey, use mine. I’ll let you in.",158
14770,JERRY, I thought it was open to the public.,158
14771,GEORGE," I uh, took care of that.",158
14772,JERRY, Wow! Zanadu . No wonder you’re putting in so many hours.  May I?,158
14773,GEORGE, I insist. I’ll fix us a drink.  I got it.,158
14774,KRAMER," Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day I’d be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I would’ve said you’re crazy… Now let’s push this giant ball of oil out the window.",158
14775,GEORGE," So, check out my view.",158
14776,JERRY," Wow! Hey, there’s Clare. I better go down.",158
14777,GEORGE," Hey, there’s Kramer & Darren.",158
14778,JERRY, There’s the giant ball of oil. Clare’s right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!,158
14779,KRAMER, Bombs away .,158
14780,JERRY, This is going to be a shame.,158
14781,GEORGE, Hello.,158
14782,KRAMER," Well, that didn’t work. Hey, how about this…ketchup and mustard in the same bottle?",158
14783,KRAMER, Yeah.,158
14784,JERRY," Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess you’re not going in anymore.",158
14785,GEORGE, Yeah.,158
14786,JERRY, So they’re not paying you your…,158
14787,GEORGE, No.,158
14788,JERRY, So you’re pretty much…,158
14789,GEORGE, Yeah.,158
14790,JERRY, What ever happened to Darren?,158
14791,KRAMER, Darren is going away for a long long time.,158
14792,JERRY, So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that…  Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil…,158
14793,GEORGE,  I’m slippery as an eel…,158
14794,KRAMER,  La la la.,158
14795,JERRY, I’m just so glad it’s back.,158
14796,ELAINE," See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.",158
14797,ELAINE, Ah nuts!,158
14798,GEORGE," All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.",159
14799,GEORGE, What is that?,159
14800,GEORGE, Are you supposed to yell it?,159
14801,GEORGE, What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?,159
14802,JERRY," Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.",159
14803,JERRY," What? All right, fine.",159
14804,JERRY," No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.",159
14805,JERRY, I get peeved.,159
14806,JERRY, Miffed.,159
14807,JERRY, Irked?,159
14808,GEORGE, Why does she want you to be mad?,159
14809,JERRY, She says I suppress my emotions.,159
14810,GEORGE, So what do you care what she thinks.,159
14811,JERRY, Good body.,159
14812,GEORGE, She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.,159
14813,JERRY," But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.",159
14814,GEORGE, Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. ,159
14815,KRAMER, Hey.,159
14816,JERRY," Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!",159
14817,KRAMER,"  What is that, a new bit?",159
14818,GEORGE," I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?",159
14819,JERRY," Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.",159
14820,KRAMER, I'll do it.,159
14821,GEORGE, Really? You wanna come?,159
14822,KRAMER," Yeah, I love going to the country.",159
14823,ELAINE, Where are they goin'?,159
14824,JERRY, Fix a screen door in Queens.,159
14825,ELAINE,"  That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?",159
14826,JERRY, Not goin' to the Knick game.,159
14827,ELAINE, I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.,159
14828,JERRY," You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.",159
14829,ELAINE,"  Oh, I don't think that's possible.",159
14830,KRAMER,  Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door.  Perfect.,159
14831,GEORGE," Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.",159
14832,KRAMER," It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.",159
14833,KRAMER," Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her.   ",159
14834,GEORGE," Dad, what's all this?",159
14835,GEORGE, You're selling computers?,159
14836,GEORGE," Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?",159
14837,JERRY," Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!",159
14838,JERRY, 1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!,159
14839,JERRY, You're damn right you're not buying it!,159
14840,JERRY, I'm open. There's just nothing in there.,159
14841,JERRY," Oh, you think I'm lying about this?",159
14842,JERRY," Well, I'm not.",159
14843,JERRY," Oh, stop it.",159
14844,JERRY, That's enough!,159
14845,JERRY, Really? It felt good.,159
14846,ELAINE," Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.",159
14847,ELAINE," Oh, congratulations, Adam. ",159
14848,JERRY, Tongue?,159
14849,ELAINE, Yeah.,159
14850,GEORGE, Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.,159
14851,JERRY, Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.,159
14852,ELAINE, And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. ,159
14853,JERRY," Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye.  Hey, I'm flyin' first class.",159
14854,ELAINE, Where did that come from?,159
14855,JERRY, Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?,159
14856,ELAINE, No.,159
14857,JERRY, Good.,159
14858,GEORGE," All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.",159
14859,JERRY, What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.,159
14860,GEORGE, Kramer.,159
14861,KRAMER, Yeah.,159
14862,GEORGE, What-what are you doing?,159
14863,KRAMER," Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.",159
14864,JERRY, What do you need it for?,159
14865,KRAMER,"  The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.",159
14866,GEORGE," Morning, ma.",159
14867,GEORGE," Morning, dad.",159
14868,GEORGE, What is Lloyd Braun doing here?,159
14869,GEORGE," Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?",159
14870,GEORGE,  What is this?,159
14871,ELAINE," So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.",159
14872,ELAINE," Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.",159
14873,ELAINE," I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.",159
14874,ELAINE," No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.",159
14875,ELAINE,"  Walnuts, mmmmmm.  ",159
14876,GEORGE," You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!",159
14877,GEORGE," You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you!  Serenity now!",159
14878,ELAINE," Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.",159
14879,ELAINE," Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.",159
14880,ELAINE, Uhh. I guess so. Why? ,159
14881,JERRY,"  Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.",159
14882,KRAMER,"  Hello, neighbor.",159
14883,JERRY," Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.",159
14884,KRAMER," Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.",159
14885,JERRY, You barbecuing tonight?,159
14886,KRAMER,  Right after the fireworks.,159
14887,JERRY," So, where do you want to eat tonight?",159
14888,JERRY, Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?,159
14889,JERRY," Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!",159
14890,JERRY, 'Maybe'!?,159
14891,JERRY, Double good-bye! ,159
14892,KRAMER," Hey, buddy!",159
14893,ELAINE,  Hey. Happy New Year!,159
14894,KRAMER,  Y'all come back reeeaall...,159
14895,ELAINE, Did you and Patty just break up?,159
14896,JERRY," Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!",159
14897,ELAINE," Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.",159
14898,JERRY," That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.",159
14899,ELAINE, Whoa. What is the matter?,159
14900,JERRY, It's Patty.,159
14901,ELAINE," Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.",159
14902,JERRY,  What--what is this salty discharge?,159
14903,ELAINE, Oh my God. You're crying.,159
14904,JERRY, This is horrible! I care!,159
14905,JERRY, Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.,159
14906,KRAMER," She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?",159
14907,JERRY, I don't know what's happening to me.,159
14908,KRAMER," Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.",159
14909,JERRY, That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.,159
14910,KRAMER," Yeah, well, she... had one, too. ",159
14911,GEORGE," Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? ",159
14912,KRAMER,"  That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!",159
14913,GEORGE,  Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.,159
14914,JERRY, You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?,159
14915,GEORGE," Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.",159
14916,JERRY," Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?",159
14917,GEORGE, What?,159
14918,JERRY," I love you, George. Come here.",159
14919,GEORGE," I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.",159
14920,JERRY, Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.,159
14921,KRAMER," Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?",159
14922,JERRY," Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!",159
14923,KRAMER," I love you, too, buddy, and George--",159
14924,GEORGE," I don't want to hear it, Kramer!",159
14925,KRAMER," Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.",159
14926,GEORGE, What signal? What-what signal?,159
14927,KRAMER," I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'",159
14928,GEORGE," If I do it, will you buy a computer?",159
14929,KRAMER," On the signal, George. On the signal.",159
14930,GEORGE, Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.,159
14931,JERRY," I love you, Costanza.",159
14932,GEORGE, Will you shut up?!,159
14933,KRAMER," Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!",159
14934,ELAINE, So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.,159
14935,GEORGE," Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.",159
14936,ELAINE, What?,159
14937,GEORGE, It means a non-Jewish woman.,159
14938,ELAINE," I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?",159
14939,GEORGE, You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.,159
14940,ELAINE," Oh, that's insane.",159
14941,GEORGE, I'll tell you what's insane,159
14942,ELAINE, I am not buying a computer from you.,159
14943,GEORGE, There's porn.,159
14944,ELAINE,  Even so.,159
14945,GEORGE, Damn it!,159
14946,ELAINE," Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.",159
14947,ELAINE," If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.",159
14948,ELAINE," Oh, no. Don't!",159
14949,ELAINE, Oy vey!,159
14950,JERRY," What happened to you, pal?",159
14951,KRAMER, Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.,159
14952,JERRY, Are you all right?,159
14953,KRAMER," Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.",159
14954,JERRY," So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?",159
14955,KRAMER,"  Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!",159
14956,ELAINE,"  Hey, what happened to you?",159
14957,KRAMER, Serenity! ,159
14958,ELAINE, Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?,159
14959,JERRY," Sit down, Elaine.",159
14960,ELAINE," Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.",159
14961,JERRY, I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.,159
14962,ELAINE, Do you have an apple or anything?,159
14963,JERRY," Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.",159
14964,ELAINE, Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.,159
14965,JERRY, Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...,159
14966,ELAINE," Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!",159
14967,JERRY," When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!",159
14968,ELAINE, What?,159
14969,JERRY, Elaine...,159
14970,GEORGE,"  Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?",159
14971,JERRY, I'm asking Elaine to marry me.,159
14972,GEORGE,  I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.,159
14973,JERRY, Elaine?,159
14974,ELAINE," Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.",159
14975,JERRY, Lippman?,159
14976,ELAINE,"  Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!",159
14977,JERRY, Can I help you?,159
14978,ELAINE, No. Stay! Stay. Stay.,159
14979,GEORGE,"  Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?",159
14980,GEORGE, What do you know? You were in the nut house.,159
14981,GEORGE, I heard they found a family in your freezer,159
14982,JERRY," What happened here, Kramer?",159
14983,KRAMER," Serenity now, serenity now...",159
14984,JERRY, Kramer!,159
14985,KRAMER," Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.",159
14986,JERRY, You don't look well.,159
14987,KRAMER," Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.",159
14988,JERRY," Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.",159
14989,KRAMER,"  Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!",159
14990,GEORGE, Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!,159
14991,KRAMER,  Serenity now!,159
14992,GEORGE," Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?",159
14993,KRAMER,  Serenity nooooowwwww!,159
14994,GEORGE, Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?,159
14995,KRAMER,"  George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.",159
14996,JERRY, He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?,159
14997,GEORGE," Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.",159
14998,JERRY," George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?",159
14999,GEORGE, All right... here goes...,159
15000,ELAINE," Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?",159
15001,ELAINE," Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.",159
15002,ELAINE,"  Well, what does that have to do...?",159
15003,GEORGE," So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.",159
15004,JERRY," Yikes. Well, good look with all that.",159
15005,GEORGE, Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.,159
15006,JERRY, I think you scared me straight.,159
15007,ELAINE," All right, Jerome, I'm in.",159
15008,JERRY, What?,159
15009,ELAINE, Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.,159
15010,JERRY," I tell ya, I don't see it happening.",159
15011,ELAINE, What? What happened to the new Jerry?,159
15012,JERRY, He doesn't work here anymore.,159
15013,ELAINE," Oh, well that's just *great!*",159
15014,GEORGE," I love you, Jerry.",159
15015,JERRY,"  Right back at ya, Slick.",159
15016,GEORGE," You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.",159
15017,ELAINE," Well, that's because you're an idiot.",159
15018,GEORGE, Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?,159
15019,GEORGE," Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.",159
15020,GEORGE, 'Hoochie mama'?,159
15021,JERRY," , go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, ""Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that?  That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?""",16
15022,ELAINE," No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.",16
15023,GEORGE," Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.",16
15024,JERRY," I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.",16
15025,ELAINE, You should run for mayor.,16
15026,JERRY," Ehh, nobody listens.",16
15027,ELAINE, Where is someone? I'm starving.,16
15028,GEORGE, I think this is him right here.,16
15029,ELAINE, Is there a table ready?,16
15030,GEORGE," I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.",16
15031,JERRY, Really? I thought things were going OK.,16
15032,GEORGE," They were, it's kinda complicated.",16
15033,JERRY, Well what is it?,16
15034,ELAINE, How many?,16
15035,JERRY," Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld.",16
15036,GEORGE, What do you wanna do?,16
15037,ELAINE," Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.",16
15038,JERRY," We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.",16
15039,GEORGE, I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?,16
15040,GEORGE," Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?",16
15041,JERRY, So did I do a terrible thing?,16
15042,ELAINE, You mean lying to your uncle?,16
15043,JERRY," I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!",16
15044,ELAINE," Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.",16
15045,JERRY," Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.",16
15046,GEORGE, He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.,16
15047,ELAINE," Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?",16
15048,JERRY," Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.",16
15049,ELAINE, Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.,16
15050,GEORGE, I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?,16
15051,ELAINE, What?,16
15052,JERRY," There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?",16
15053,ELAINE, I've never seen her before.,16
15054,JERRY, I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.,16
15055,ELAINE, I'm sorry.,16
15056,ELAINE," Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.",16
15057,JERRY, Well maybe they were here from before.,16
15058,ELAINE," No no no, they weren't here before.",16
15059,ELAINE, Find out what's going on!,16
15060,JERRY," Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.",16
15061,ELAINE, Yeah.,16
15062,JERRY, Seinfeld.,16
15063,ELAINE, Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.,16
15064,JERRY," Boy, you are really hungry.",16
15065,GEORGE," If anything happens here, can I count on you?",16
15066,JERRY, What?,16
15067,GEORGE, If we decide to go at it.,16
15068,JERRY," Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...",16
15069,GEORGE," I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.",16
15070,ELAINE, I'm gonna faint...,16
15071,JERRY," George, who is that woman in the stripes?",16
15072,GEORGE, I don't know her.,16
15073,JERRY, She looks so familiar.,16
15074,ELAINE," Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.",16
15075,JERRY," I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.",16
15076,ELAINE, What do you mean?,16
15077,JERRY," You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.",16
15078,GEORGE, What are they gonna do?,16
15079,JERRY," They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.",16
15080,ELAINE," 50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?",16
15081,JERRY," 50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.",16
15082,ELAINE," OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...",16
15083,JERRY," No, no tricks.",16
15084,ELAINE," Should I do it, George?",16
15085,GEORGE, For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.,16
15086,ELAINE," Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.",16
15087,JERRY, What happened?,16
15088,ELAINE, Did you see that?,16
15089,GEORGE, What were you doing?,16
15090,JERRY," George, the phone's free.",16
15091,GEORGE, Alleluia.,16
15092,GEORGE," Excuse me, I was waiting here.",16
15093,GEORGE, I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!,16
15094,GEORGE, That's not the point. The point is I was here first.,16
15095,GEORGE, Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!,16
15096,GEORGE," Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.",16
15097,ELAINE," How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.",16
15098,JERRY, I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?,16
15099,GEORGE," Yeah, well, he probably bought it.",16
15100,JERRY, So what happened with Tatiana?,16
15101,GEORGE, I shouldn't even tell you this.,16
15102,JERRY, Come on...,16
15103,GEORGE," Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.",16
15104,JERRY, I'm with you.,16
15105,GEORGE," Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...",16
15106,JERRY, This could only happen to you.,16
15107,GEORGE," So I finally stop and say, ""Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left"".",16
15108,JERRY, You said this to her after.,16
15109,GEORGE, No. During.,16
15110,JERRY," Oh, boy.",16
15111,GEORGE, Yeah.,16
15112,JERRY, Wow! So...?,16
15113,GEORGE," So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's",16
15114,ELAINE," I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.",16
15115,ELAINE," Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.",16
15116,GEORGE, She's off. ,16
15117,ELAINE," Jerry, talk to that guy again.",16
15118,JERRY, What am I gonna say?,16
15119,ELAINE, Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.,16
15120,JERRY," Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.",16
15121,ELAINE, He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?,16
15122,ELAINE, Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!,16
15123,GEORGE, She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.,16
15124,JERRY, Didja leave a message?,16
15125,GEORGE," Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.",16
15126,ELAINE," Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...",16
15127,JERRY, Where do I know her?,16
15128,JERRY, Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?,16
15129,JERRY," Good, good, good... What's goin' on?",16
15130,JERRY," Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.",16
15131,JERRY," I know, I know... Well, you know.",16
15132,JERRY," Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.",16
15133,ELAINE," Hi, I'm Elaine.",16
15134,JERRY," I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...",16
15135,JERRY," Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.",16
15136,ELAINE, The one you broke the plans with tonight?,16
15137,JERRY," Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...",16
15138,JERRY," ...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.",16
15139,ELAINE, You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.,16
15140,JERRY," Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!",16
15141,JERRY," Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.",16
15142,ELAINE," Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.",16
15143,JERRY, In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?,16
15144,ELAINE," Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.",16
15145,GEORGE, 20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?,16
15146,ELAINE," Well what do you want to give him, change?",16
15147,GEORGE, It's more than the meal!,16
15148,JERRY," Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.",16
15149,GEORGE," Alright. 7,7,  6. I'm not gonna eat that much!",16
15150,JERRY," I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?",16
15151,GEORGE," Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.",16
15152,ELAINE," I guess it's you, Jer.",16
15153,JERRY, Me? What about you?,16
15154,ELAINE," Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.",16
15155,JERRY," The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?",16
15156,ELAINE, Give me the money.,16
15157,ELAINE, How's it going'?,16
15158,ELAINE," Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.",16
15159,ELAINE, If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.,16
15160,ELAINE," No no, I want to eat now! ",16
15161,ELAINE," No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.",16
15162,JERRY, You lost the 20.,16
15163,ELAINE," Well, how could he do that?",16
15164,GEORGE, You didn't make it clear.,16
15165,ELAINE, Make it clear?,16
15166,JERRY," What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.",16
15167,JERRY, Seinfeld.,16
15168,JERRY," No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?",16
15169,JERRY," Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.",16
15170,JERRY," Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?",16
15171,GEORGE, So?,16
15172,JERRY, There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.,16
15173,ELAINE, So when are we gonna eat?,16
15174,JERRY," Five, ten minutes.",16
15175,GEORGE, We should have left earlier. I told you.,16
15176,JERRY, I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.,16
15177,ELAINE," Oh, well I have to eat.",16
15178,JERRY," Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.",16
15179,ELAINE, Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?,16
15180,JERRY, We'll eat it in the movie.,16
15181,ELAINE," Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?",16
15182,JERRY, Well what do you suggest?,16
15183,ELAINE," I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.",16
15184,JERRY," I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.",16
15185,ELAINE, I can't have popcorn for dinner!,16
15186,JERRY, So they have hotdogs there.,16
15187,ELAINE," Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.",16
15188,GEORGE," I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.",16
15189,GEORGE," Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?",16
15190,GEORGE," Well, was it for Costanza or...",16
15191,GEORGE, Well was it a woman?,16
15192,GEORGE, She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.,16
15193,JERRY, Who's Cartwright?,16
15194,GEORGE, I'm Cartwright!,16
15195,JERRY, You're not Cartwri-,16
15196,GEORGE," Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.",16
15197,ELAINE," Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.",16
15198,JERRY, So You're not going?,16
15199,ELAINE, You don't need us.,16
15200,JERRY," Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.",16
15201,GEORGE, Should we tell him we're leaving?,16
15202,ELAINE, What for? Let's just get out of here.,16
15203,JERRY," Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, ""This is good, who is this? I like this person"". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like,  ""Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!""",16
15204,JERRY, Are you sure you can't stay longer?,160
15205,JERRY, He was 96 years old.,160
15206,JERRY," Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.",160
15207,JERRY, Really?,160
15208,KRAMER," Hey, Seinfelds!",160
15209,KRAMER, How long are you staying?,160
15210,KRAMER," Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...",160
15211,JERRY, Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?,160
15212,JERRY, Did you give blood?,160
15213,KRAMER," No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.",160
15214,JERRY, In case of what?,160
15215,KRAMER," Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.",160
15216,JERRY, Are we finished?,160
15217,KRAMER, Done.,160
15218,ELAINE, Yeah...,160
15219,ELAINE," I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.",160
15220,ELAINE," Tomorrow evening, sure.",160
15221,ELAINE, Do I know anyone??,160
15222,GEORGE, What are you doing?,160
15223,GEORGE," Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.",160
15224,GEORGE," Um, cream soda?",160
15225,ELAINE," Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?",160
15226,JERRY," Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is",160
15227,ELAINE," I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.",160
15228,JERRY," What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?",160
15229,GEORGE," I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!",160
15230,ELAINE, You just left? What did you tell her?,160
15231,GEORGE, I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.,160
15232,JERRY, What?,160
15233,GEORGE," I don't know, I was starving Jerry!",160
15234,GEORGE," Oh, pudding! You want some?",160
15235,JERRY," Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?",160
15236,GEORGE," What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.",160
15237,JERRY," Elaine, what do you think?",160
15238,ELAINE, I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.,160
15239,KRAMER," My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.",160
15240,KRAMER," Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!",160
15241,GEORGE," So eh, what do you say?",160
15242,GEORGE," Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...",160
15243,GEORGE," Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?",160
15244,GEORGE," Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!",160
15245,JERRY," Didn't go for it, huh?",160
15246,GEORGE, No.,160
15247,JERRY," So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?",160
15248,GEORGE," She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.",160
15249,JERRY," Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.",160
15250,GEORGE," Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.",160
15251,JERRY," Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.",160
15252,GEORGE," Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.",160
15253,JERRY," I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.",160
15254,GEORGE," Well, I guess these would be out of the question. ",160
15255,JERRY, What the hell is that?,160
15256,GEORGE, Pudding skin singles.,160
15257,KRAMER," Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware.",160
15258,JERRY," Oh, why?",160
15259,KRAMER, I closed down my account at the blood bank.,160
15260,JERRY," What, it...it's here in the building?",160
15261,KRAMER," Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?",160
15262,JERRY," No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.",160
15263,KRAMER," You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.",160
15264,ELAINE," Hey, working out?",160
15265,JERRY, You know it and I ditched all my junk food.,160
15266,KRAMER, What the heck is going on here?,160
15267,JERRY," Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.",160
15268,KRAMER," Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.",160
15269,ELAINE, Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.,160
15270,JERRY, Is this about me?,160
15271,ELAINE, No.,160
15272,JERRY," Oh, then I lost interest.",160
15273,ELAINE," Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...",160
15274,KRAMER," For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later.  Well, somebody's baby-sitting.",160
15275,ELAINE, You? I'm more responsible than you are!,160
15276,KRAMER," Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.",160
15277,GEORGE," Oh, Tara!",160
15278,KRAMER," Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.",160
15279,ELAINE, Kramer...,160
15280,KRAMER, Don't take my money!,160
15281,ELAINE," It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.",160
15282,KRAMER," No, I'm the baby-sitter.",160
15283,ELAINE," No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.",160
15284,ELAINE," Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out... what's that, some raccoon or something...",160
15285,ELAINE, Hi Jimmy.  Ouch! ,160
15286,JERRY," Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.",160
15287,KRAMER, There was an incident.,160
15288,JERRY," Oh no, where's the blood?  It's in here isn't it?",160
15289,KRAMER, Would you stop it.,160
15290,JERRY, What is this?,160
15291,KRAMER, It's Jell-O.,160
15292,JERRY, What about this? This is blood isn't it?!,160
15293,KRAMER," This is tomato juice, look...",160
15294,JERRY," Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!",160
15295,KRAMER, Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.,160
15296,JERRY," Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding?",160
15297,KRAMER," Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.",160
15298,JERRY," Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...",160
15299,KRAMER, Heads up!,160
15300,JERRY, Aaah...,160
15301,ELAINE, I wish I was dead.,160
15302,ELAINE, As long as you don't put...,160
15303,ELAINE, Thanks for the re-fill.,160
15304,ELAINE," Oh, he's...he's a joy...",160
15305,ELAINE," Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.",160
15306,ELAINE," It's not serious, is it?",160
15307,ELAINE," Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. ",160
15308,JERRY, Aah!,160
15309,KRAMER," It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.",160
15310,JERRY, I can see that! What happened?,160
15311,KRAMER," That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.",160
15312,JERRY, I'll remember that.,160
15313,KRAMER," Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.",160
15314,JERRY, What?,160
15315,KRAMER," Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.",160
15316,GEORGE, Three pints of Kramer's blood?,160
15317,JERRY, I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.,160
15318,GEORGE," Well, so much for purification week.",160
15319,JERRY," So, how's the fornicating gourmet?",160
15320,GEORGE," Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.",160
15321,JERRY," George, we're trying to have a civilization here.",160
15322,ELAINE, Hey.,160
15323,JERRY," Hey, how was baby-sitting?",160
15324,ELAINE," Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.",160
15325,JERRY," Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.",160
15326,ELAINE," It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.",160
15327,GEORGE," She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.",160
15328,JERRY, Really?,160
15329,KRAMER," Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?",160
15330,JERRY, I'm not touching that thing.,160
15331,KRAMER," Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.",160
15332,JERRY," Oh, no...",160
15333,KRAMER," What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse,  hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...",160
15334,JERRY," Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.",160
15335,KRAMER," So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!",160
15336,JERRY," All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.",160
15337,KRAMER," No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?",160
15338,JERRY, Hello?,160
15339,JERRY, Kramer called you?,160
15340,JERRY," Yes, I'm fine.",160
15341,JERRY," I don't need a personal trainer.  all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.",160
15342,JERRY, Why are you calling my parents?,160
15343,KRAMER," Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?",160
15344,JERRY, Why here?,160
15345,KRAMER," Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.",160
15346,JERRY, Ok...,160
15347,KRAMER," Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?",160
15348,JERRY, Fine...,160
15349,KRAMER, Ok!,160
15350,JERRY, No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!,160
15351,KRAMER, Blood!,160
15352,JERRY, All right.,160
15353,JERRY, Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?,160
15354,ELAINE," Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.",160
15355,ELAINE," I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.",160
15356,ELAINE, No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!,160
15357,ELAINE," All right, but I'm running out of purses here. ",160
15358,JERRY," Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?",160
15359,JERRY," Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?",160
15360,JERRY, For what?,160
15361,JERRY, How many session did my parents paid for?,160
15362,GEORGE," Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight!",160
15363,GEORGE, And now for the trifecta. ,160
15364,GEORGE, Pleasuring you?,160
15365,JERRY, What is this?,160
15366,KRAMER, We're making sausages.,160
15367,JERRY, I thought you were gonna watch a video.,160
15368,KRAMER," Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.",160
15369,JERRY," Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.",160
15370,KRAMER," All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.",160
15371,JERRY," Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.",160
15372,JERRY, No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...,160
15373,JERRY," So, the free love buffet is over?",160
15374,GEORGE, I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.,160
15375,JERRY," Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.",160
15376,JERRY, What's going on?,160
15377,GEORGE, I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.,160
15378,JERRY," Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.",160
15379,GEORGE, I think you're right. You gonna eat that?,160
15380,JERRY," No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.",160
15381,ELAINE," Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.",160
15382,GEORGE, These fries are really really good...,160
15383,JERRY," All right, that's enough of that. ",160
15384,ELAINE," I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.",160
15385,GEORGE," Uuh, sleepy.",160
15386,ELAINE," No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.",160
15387,JERRY," Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.",160
15388,ELAINE," Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.",160
15389,KRAMER, Why did you get rid of that sausage?,160
15390,JERRY," It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.",160
15391,KRAMER," Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?",160
15392,JERRY, What's wrong with yours?,160
15393,KRAMER, I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.,160
15394,JERRY," All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!",160
15395,KRAMER," All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.",160
15396,KRAMER," Oh, man... ""If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner"". Never, I can't do that.",160
15397,KRAMER," Oh, mama...",160
15398,KRAMER," Shees, come on.....this thing is bone dry. ",160
15399,ELAINE, Vivian...,160
15400,ELAINE, Hi! This is my friend George.,160
15401,ELAINE, I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.,160
15402,ELAINE,  You're up.,160
15403,GEORGE, Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.,160
15404,GEORGE," Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.",160
15405,GEORGE, Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.,160
15406,GEORGE," All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.",160
15407,GEORGE, That's because it's underwater.,160
15408,GEORGE, Is it?,160
15409,GEORGE," Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.",160
15410,GEORGE," Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?",160
15411,GEORGE, Very.,160
15412,GEORGE, Vivian!!,160
15413,JERRY, Is this really necessary?,160
15414,JERRY, What if I can't keep up?,160
15415,JERRY, What's going on?,160
15416,JERRY," Oh my God, the blood!",160
15417,ELAINE, So how long did they drag you?,160
15418,JERRY," Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.",160
15419,ELAINE, Hi George. Hi Jimmy.,160
15420,GEORGE," Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.",160
15421,GEORGE, Ouch!,160
15422,JERRY, What's the kid doing here?,160
15423,GEORGE, I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.,160
15424,JERRY," Oh, that's a drag...",160
15425,KRAMER, That kid...,160
15426,JERRY, You put blood in the car?!,160
15427,KRAMER," Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.",160
15428,JERRY," Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.",160
15429,KRAMER, You didn't get the blood from me.,160
15430,JERRY, Then who?,160
15431,JERRY, Aaaaahhh...!!!,160
15432,JERRY,  Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.,161
15433,GEORGE,  Chinese food!,161
15434,JERRY,"  Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you.",161
15435,GEORGE, Who was it?,161
15436,JERRY, I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.,161
15437,GEORGE, What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?,161
15438,JERRY," No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.",161
15439,GEORGE, Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.,161
15440,JERRY, Why? He's harmless.,161
15441,GEORGE, Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.,161
15442,JERRY," He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.",161
15443,GEORGE, I made him up.,161
15444,JERRY, So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?,161
15445,GEORGE, No.,161
15446,JERRY, Too bad. It was erotic.,161
15447,KRAMER,  Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!,161
15448,JERRY, 'Pottery Barn'?,161
15449,KRAMER, I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.,161
15450,GEORGE,  Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?,161
15451,JERRY, Why don't you just throw 'em out?,161
15452,KRAMER," Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.",161
15453,JERRY,  Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?,161
15454,GEORGE, I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.,161
15455,JERRY, So call now.,161
15456,GEORGE," I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?",161
15457,JERRY, That's him.,161
15458,GEORGE, Is he still nuts?,161
15459,JERRY," What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?'",161
15460,ELAINE, Mmm. De-lish.,161
15461,ELAINE," Delish. You know, short for delicious.",161
15462,ELAINE, Yeah.,161
15463,ELAINE,"  Oh, sure.",161
15464,GEORGE," Hey, it's Georgie.",161
15465,GEORGE, Ma!,161
15466,GEORGE," Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.",161
15467,GEORGE, Chinese food?,161
15468,KRAMER,"  Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?",161
15469,JERRY," So, maybe they had Chinese food?",161
15470,GEORGE," After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades.",161
15471,JERRY," Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.",161
15472,ELAINE,"  Well, gentlemen. Lainie is... in love.",161
15473,GEORGE," That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.",161
15474,ELAINE," Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.",161
15475,JERRY," It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?",161
15476,ELAINE," Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him?",161
15477,GEORGE," Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.",161
15478,JERRY," So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.",161
15479,ELAINE," Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.",161
15480,KRAMER,"  Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.",161
15481,JERRY, Stop the mail?,161
15482,KRAMER, That's... even better!,161
15483,JERRY," Hey, Frankie! So, where's the car?",161
15484,JERRY, Inside the van?,161
15485,JERRY, We were ten.,161
15486,JERRY, I don't want a van.,161
15487,ELAINE," Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.",161
15488,JERRY," You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.",161
15489,ELAINE," Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'",161
15490,JERRY, Always helpful.,161
15491,GEORGE," Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back.",161
15492,GEORGE, What? Where are you going?,161
15493,GEORGE, You're going like that?,161
15494,GEORGE,  No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.,161
15495,ELAINE," Okay, Jack.  Can I use your phone?",161
15496,JERRY," Aye, aye.",161
15497,JERRY, Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.,161
15498,JERRY," Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?",161
15499,JERRY," No, no, no. Just hypothetically.",161
15500,JERRY," No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.",161
15501,KRAMER,"  Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.",161
15502,JERRY, Where'd you get the bricks?,161
15503,KRAMER," Jerry, the whole building is brick.",161
15504,JERRY, So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.,161
15505,KRAMER," A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.",161
15506,JERRY, I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.,161
15507,KRAMER," Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.",161
15508,JERRY, OK.,161
15509,KRAMER," All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'",161
15510,JERRY, I don't want to trade.,161
15511,KRAMER," No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.",161
15512,JERRY," Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now.",161
15513,KRAMER," Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.",161
15514,ELAINE," Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. ",161
15515,KRAMER," Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.",161
15516,KRAMER," Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.",161
15517,KRAMER," Oh, yes, I am.",161
15518,KRAMER, The bank can pay 'em.,161
15519,KRAMER," E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.",161
15520,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!",161
15521,GEORGE,  Welcome back.,161
15522,GEORGE, Quick for a... catered affair.,161
15523,GEORGE, You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!,161
15524,GEORGE, I'm not following.,161
15525,GEORGE, You're cuttin' me loose?,161
15526,GEORGE, They don't want to see me anymore!,161
15527,JERRY, But this is what you've always wanted.,161
15528,GEORGE, It is. I'm just not ready yet.,161
15529,JERRY," Aw, that's kind of sweet.",161
15530,GEORGE," Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.",161
15531,JERRY," Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?",161
15532,GEORGE, You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.,161
15533,JERRY, Mother of God.,161
15534,GEORGE," One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?",161
15535,JERRY," That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?",161
15536,JERRY, That is the guy!,161
15537,GEORGE, Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?,161
15538,JERRY," No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.",161
15539,GEORGE, That's pretty pathetic.,161
15540,JERRY, I know. They're not even related.,161
15541,ELAINE,  Hey.,161
15542,GEORGE, Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going.,161
15543,JERRY," Hey, have fun at the... family reunion.  So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?",161
15544,ELAINE, Isn't he the best?,161
15545,JERRY," Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?",161
15546,ELAINE," Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.",161
15547,JERRY,"  Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this?",161
15548,ELAINE," Oh, no.",161
15549,JERRY," Oh, yes.",161
15550,JERRY,"  Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy.",161
15551,KRAMER,"  Yeah, I called about the van.",161
15552,GEORGE,  Some more merlot?,161
15553,GEORGE," Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive.",161
15554,GEORGE," I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.",161
15555,GEORGE," No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.",161
15556,GEORGE, All right?,161
15557,GEORGE, Well... we could dance around it a little first.,161
15558,GEORGE, Whoa! Whoa! Geez!,161
15559,KRAMER,"  So, how come you're selling it?",161
15560,JERRY, You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.,161
15561,KRAMER, How many miles?,161
15562,JERRY, Two.,161
15563,KRAMER, City or highway?,161
15564,JERRY," Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?",161
15565,KRAMER,"  Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that.",161
15566,JERRY," All right, just get out of here.",161
15567,KRAMER," All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van.",161
15568,JERRY," OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?'",161
15569,KRAMER,"  Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.",161
15570,JERRY, You put that in!,161
15571,KRAMER,  And I'm glad I did. Here.,161
15572,JERRY, You want to trade me an undershirt?,161
15573,KRAMER," No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.",161
15574,JERRY, That's disgusting.,161
15575,KRAMER," Well, it's my final offer.",161
15576,ELAINE," Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.",161
15577,ELAINE, You're not taking me back?,161
15578,ELAINE, He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...,161
15579,KRAMER,"  Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.",161
15580,KRAMER, Because we're blind to their tyranny.,161
15581,KRAMER," Yeah. Move along, Betty.",161
15582,KRAMER," Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.",161
15583,KRAMER, What?,161
15584,KRAMER," Yeah, nice to meet you.",161
15585,JERRY, She's into it?,161
15586,GEORGE, She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.,161
15587,JERRY, So have your parents found out about it?,161
15588,GEORGE, She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.,161
15589,JERRY," Brave new world, alright.",161
15590,KRAMER,"  Hey, you guys.",161
15591,JERRY," Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?",161
15592,KRAMER," Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in.",161
15593,JERRY, It's Sunday.,161
15594,GEORGE, Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?,161
15595,KRAMER," Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution.",161
15596,GEORGE, Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket.,161
15597,JERRY," Hey, I want my van keys back.",161
15598,KRAMER," Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.",161
15599,JERRY, Are you insane? Give 'em to me.,161
15600,KRAMER," No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.",161
15601,GEORGE," Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.",161
15602,KRAMER," Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.",161
15603,JERRY," Oh, no, not Frankie.",161
15604,KRAMER," Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.",161
15605,JERRY," Oh, no, the woods! The hole!",161
15606,KRAMER,  Hey.,161
15607,KRAMER," I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.",161
15608,KRAMER, What?,161
15609,KRAMER, Are you through?,161
15610,KRAMER, Are you through?,161
15611,KRAMER," Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.",161
15612,KRAMER," No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!",161
15613,KRAMER,  Hey!,161
15614,JERRY," Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?",161
15615,JERRY, Have a nice night.,161
15616,GEORGE," Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?",161
15617,GEORGE," I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!",161
15618,GEORGE,  I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!,161
15619,ELAINE," So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'",161
15620,ELAINE," Really, what was the first?",161
15621,ELAINE, What?,161
15622,ELAINE," Well what, what about your fact-checking job?",161
15623,JERRY,  Frankie... come on out of there.,161
15624,JERRY," But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.",161
15625,JERRY," Yeah, let's just get out of here.",161
15626,KRAMER, Huh? Who are you?,161
15627,KRAMER, Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?,161
15628,KRAMER, Henry... can I get out of here now?,161
15629,KRAMER, Oh?,161
15630,KRAMER, Yeah.,161
15631,KRAMER, Yeah! Ha ha.,161
15632,KRAMER," I'm very, very sorry.",161
15633,KRAMER, Sure do!,161
15634,KRAMER,  Geez. Newman?,161
15635,JERRY," Hey, George!",161
15636,GEORGE," Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!",161
15637,JERRY," What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman.",161
15638,GEORGE, Oh. The summer me.,161

15650,JERRY," Yeah, ya know Cain slew Able.",162

15652,JERRY," Oh, no.",162
15653,KRAMER," All right then, what was it?",162
15654,JERRY," Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.",162
15655,KRAMER," The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.",162
15656,JERRY," Ya broke my blender, didn’t ya?",162
15657,KRAMER, Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just  just didn’t work out.,162
15658,JERRY, I knew it.,162
15659,JERRY, Why were you making gravel?,162
15660,KRAMER, Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.,162
15661,KRAMER," Aahh, this looks familiar…",162
15662,JERRY, Of course. It's garbage.,162
15663,KRAMER," No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs.  Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show!  They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!",162
15664,JERRY," Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.",162
15665,KRAMER," Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.",162
15666,JERRY," Come on, Kramer, get out of there.",162
15667,KRAMER," No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.",162

15672,GEORGE, So uh… where we eating?,162
15673,JERRY, And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.,162
15674,JERRY, Wow! ,162
15675,JERRY, Where did you get all these?,162
15676,JERRY," Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe.  With a full frogman suit.",162
15677,JERRY, I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.,162
15678,JERRY," I just want a, touch ‘em a little.",162
15679,ELAINE," Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?",162
15680,ELAINE, ,162
15681,ELAINE, You've been an enormous help.													 ,162
15682,JERRY, You ran over some pigeons? How many?,162
15683,GEORGE, What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?,162
15684,JERRY," Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.",162
15685,GEORGE, Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!,162
15686,JERRY, So Miranda's cooled on ya?,162
15687,GEORGE, I'm getting nothing.,162
15688,JERRY," Yeah, me neither.",162
15689,GEORGE, Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?,162
15690,JERRY," Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!",162

15697,ELAINE, All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!,162
15698,JERRY, So he just sidles up?,162
15699,ELAINE, That's right! He's a real sidler. ,162
15700,JERRY, Maybe you just didn't see him.,162
15701,ELAINE," Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from ""The Lion King"".",162
15702,JERRY, Hakuna Matata?,162
15703,ELAINE, I thought I was alone.,162
15704,JERRY, That doesn't make it right.,162
15705,JERRY," See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...",162
15706,ELAINE," Would you just, let it go?",162
15707,KRAMER,"  Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!",162

15714,KRAMER, Yeah ... backstage.,162
15715,ELAINE, Ehnn! This chair smells like garbage.,162
15716,KRAMER,"  Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.",162
15717,JERRY, I'm gonna get that. ,162
15718,KRAMER," All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. ",162
15719,KRAMER," Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you!  Boy, is it possible that you’re even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?",162
15720,ELAINE, ,162

15722,ELAINE," Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.",162
15723,ELAINE, What? ,162
15724,JERRY, So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.,162
15725,KRAMER," Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.",162
15726,JERRY," Yeah, that was me.",162
15727,KRAMER," Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an…",162

15736,ELAINE," Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.",162
15737,KRAMER," Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?",162
15738,ELAINE," Kramer, what is wrong with you?",162
15739,KRAMER, What do you mean?,162
15740,ELAINE," Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards",162
15741,ELAINE,"  I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.",162
15742,JERRY," You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!",162

15753,KRAMER, That was the wrong card.,162
15754,GEORGE, I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!,162
15755,JERRY, So they're like everyone else.,162

15779,KRAMER, Newman. ,162
15780,JERRY," Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!",162
15781,KRAMER," What do you mean ""wrong kind of medicine""?",162
15782,JERRY, She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!,162
15783,GEORGE," Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!",162
15784,KRAMER," Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment.  Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!",162
15785,JERRY," Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!",162
15786,KRAMER," Smile, everyone! We're back!",162
15787,ELAINE," Yes, Lou.  You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ...  Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...",162

15793,JERRY, ... I think. Have some more wine. ,162
15794,GEORGE, Oh.,162
15795,JERRY," Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.",162

15797,JERRY, More heavy gravy?,162
15798,GEORGE,"  Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. ",162
15799,KRAMER," We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?",162
15800,KRAMER, We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.,162
15801,KRAMER, I'll pretend I didn't hear that.,162
15802,GEORGE, Is he dead?,162
15803,GEORGE," So ... uh, squirrel.",162
15804,GEORGE, What's that?,162
15805,GEORGE, He has no home. He's a squirrel.,162
15806,JERRY, Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.,162
15807,GEORGE," It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!",162
15808,KRAMER," Jerry,  aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.",162
15809,JERRY," What about my ""questionable material""?",162

15813,GEORGE, That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?,162
15814,KRAMER," What? Two animal acts on the same show?  What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? ",162
15815,GEORGE, I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!,162
15816,ELAINE," Hey!  ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think I’ve got that problem, solved.",162

15819,GEORGE," Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.",162
15820,ELAINE, You took him over to Celia's?,162
15821,JERRY, What? It's a victimless crime.,162
15822,ELAINE, What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?,162
15823,JERRY," Okay, one victim.",162
15824,ELAINE, I think it's unconscionable.,162
15825,GEORGE," Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.",162
15826,ELAINE, EZ Bake oven?,162

15831,GEORGE," Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.",162
15832,JERRY, You're like eight years old.,162
15833,GEORGE, I was seven and a half.,162

15835,ELAINE," No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!",162
15836,ELAINE, No Mister Peterman.,162
15837,ELAINE,  Lou! In here!  We have to talk.,162
15838,ELAINE,"  Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.",162
15839,ELAINE, Because they're turning your teeth green?,162
15840,ELAINE," O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.",162

15844,KRAMER," Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.",162
15845,KRAMER," But first, we're talking with, Jerry.  Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?",162
15846,JERRY, It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.,162
15847,KRAMER," And she doesn't know anything, about this?",162
15848,JERRY," No, not a thing.",162
15849,KRAMER," Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!",162
15850,JERRY," What, What is this? What is she doing here?",162
15851,KRAMER, It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.,162
15852,JERRY," Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?",162
15853,GEORGE," Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! ",162
15854,KRAMER, George I told you we're booked!,162
15855,KRAMER," Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.",162

15857,GEORGE," Ahhhh, Ahh, Ah, Ahhh, Ahh, Ah!",162
15858,KRAMER,  Are we getting this?,162
15859,JERRY, So the whole set was destroyed?,162
15860,KRAMER," Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.",162
15861,GEORGE," Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry ‘bout the set.",162
15862,KRAMER, I’ll tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.,162
15863,JERRY, So the squirrel's gonna make it?,162
15864,GEORGE," Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm… sleeping on the couch.",162
15865,JERRY, On the couch? So you're...,162
15866,GEORGE, Still getting nothing!,162
15867,GEORGE, So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!,162

15870,ELAINE, Hey.,163
15871,JERRY, Morning.,163
15872,ELAINE," Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.",163
15873,JERRY, But why?,163
15874,ELAINE, I need some space.,163
15875,GEORGE, Does that mean I have to go too?,163
15876,JERRY, You don't think she's just talking to me?,163
15877,GEORGE," Hey, shut up.",163
15878,JERRY, You shut up.,163
15879,ELAINE, I hate this.,163
15880,KRAMER, You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.,163
15881,ELAINE," No, I don't want this anymore.",163
15882,JERRY, We'll come to work with you.,163
15883,GEORGE, And on your dates.,163
15884,JERRY, And shopping.,163
15885,KRAMER, And to the bathroom.,163
15886,ELAINE, I can't breath...I'm sorry... You're killing me!,163
15887,ELAINE,  Turn your alarm off!! ,163
15888,GEORGE," Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.",163
15889,GEORGE," That should be 14, let me just...",163
15890,GEORGE," You won't regret this, sir.",163
15891,GEORGE,...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.,163
15892,JERRY, The boom box incident?,163
15893,GEORGE," Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.",163
15894,JERRY, Seems reasonable.,163
15895,GEORGE," Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.",163
15896,JERRY, Even more reasonable.,163
15897,GEORGE," So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.",163
15898,JERRY, And that guy is your new boss?,163
15899,GEORGE, Until that stupid photo jogs his memory.,163
15900,KRAMER," Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?",163
15901,GEORGE, Yeah.,163
15902,KRAMER," Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.",163
15903,JERRY," Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.",163
15904,GEORGE, It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.,163
15905,KRAMER, You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.,163
15906,GEORGE, Like retouched.,163
15907,KRAMER, You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.,163
15908,GEORGE," Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.",163
15909,KRAMER," Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...",163
15910,KRAMER, I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.,163
15911,JERRY, Neither have I.,163
15912,KRAMER," Hey, our meat problems are solved.",163
15913,JERRY, Where did you get this thing?,163
15914,KRAMER," I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.",163
15915,ELAINE, Hey.,163
15916,KRAMER," Hey, spice.  Welcome to flavor country.",163
15917,ELAINE," Yeah, that's pretty good.",163
15918,JERRY," Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.",163
15919,ELAINE, Sara Sitarides?,163
15920,JERRY, Mmhu.,163
15921,ELAINE, Oh...,163
15922,JERRY, What's with you?,163
15923,ELAINE," You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?",163
15924,JERRY, Your whole building smells like potatoes.,163
15925,ELAINE," This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 3",163
15926,KRAMER," You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.",163
15927,ELAINE, How do you do that?,163
15928,KRAMER," Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.",163
15929,JERRY, I think we might have one left in the stock room.,163
15930,KRAMER, This hallway smells like potatoes.,163
15931,ELAINE," I know, I know, this is it. ",163
15932,KRAMER," Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...",163
15933,ELAINE, I think I'll let you do it.,163
15934,KRAMER," No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.",163
15935,ELAINE," No, I really don't want to.",163
15936,KRAMER," Well, I don't want to either.",163
15937,ELAINE, I thought you had done this before.,163
15938,KRAMER, It's just...it's no picnic.,163
15939,ELAINE," Well, how are we gonna do it?",163
15940,KRAMER," Alright, fine fine, I'll do it.",163
15941,KRAMER, Oh mama.,163
15942,ELAINE, Are you okay?,163
15943,KRAMER, I will lose that nail.,163
15944,JERRY," Well, I have this neighbor...",163
15945,JERRY, Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?,163
15946,JERRY, Cause I hit a whopper last week!,163
15947,GEORGE, What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.,163
15948,GEORGE," Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!",163
15949,GEORGE, I am aware!,163
15950,ELAINE, The cat.,163
15951,JERRY, He took out Kruger?,163
15952,GEORGE, I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.,163
15953,KRAMER, This slicer is indomitable.,163
15954,JERRY, Where did you get that butcher's coat?,163
15955,KRAMER," You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.",163
15956,ELAINE," Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.",163
15957,KRAMER," See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.",163
15958,ELAINE, What did he do about it?,163
15959,KRAMER," Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.",163
15960,ELAINE," Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.",163
15961,KRAMER," Oh, that's a prickly one.",163
15962,ELAINE," Yeah, how's the doctor date?",163
15963,JERRY," Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.",163
15964,ELAINE," Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.",163
15965,JERRY, Dermatology?,163
15966,ELAINE," Yes, she's a dermatologist.",163
15967,JERRY," Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.",163
15968,KRAMER," The slicer! Elaine, let's go.",163
15969,ELAINE, Where are we going?,163
15970,KRAMER, The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.,163
15971,GEORGE, When are you going on your next date with her?,163
15972,JERRY," Oh, what's the point?",163
15973,GEORGE," What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?",163
15974,JERRY, Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.,163
15975,GEORGE," This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!",163
15976,JERRY, Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor!,163
15977,GEORGE," Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!",163
15978,JERRY, You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.,163
15979,GEORGE," No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...",163
15980,JERRY, Flowers?,163
15981,GEORGE," Yeah, you gotta do it classy ",163
15982,JERRY," So, you've done this?",163
15983,GEORGE, Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.,163
15984,KRAMER, I think we are looking half a millimeter.,163
15985,ELAINE, Can it cut that thin?,163
15986,KRAMER," Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.",163
15987,ELAINE, How did you know you cut it?,163
15988,KRAMER," Well, I guess I just assumed.",163
15989,ELAINE," Hold on kitty, dinner's coming.",163
15990,KRAMER," Yeah, that's a hall of famer.",163
15991,ELAINE," Alright, let's do it.",163
15992,KRAMER," Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...",163
15993,ELAINE," Come on, come on kitty... ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?",163
15994,KRAMER," Oh no, I don't think so.",163
15995,ELAINE, Why not?,163
15996,KRAMER," Well, you're not checked at on it.",163
15997,ELAINE, What do I have to know?,163
15998,KRAMER," Well, where the meat goes?",163
15999,ELAINE, Right there.,163
16000,KRAMER, Where do you turn it on?,163
16001,ELAINE, Right there.,163
16002,KRAMER, But where does the meat go?,163
16003,JERRY," Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?",163
16004,JERRY," It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!",163
16005,JERRY, You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!,163
16006,JERRY, She saved your life?,163
16007,JERRY, Skin cancer! Damn.,163
16008,ELAINE," You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.													",163
16009,ELAINE, These heals are so uneven. ,163
16010,GEORGE, What is this? This is a drawing.,163
16011,GEORGE, This is a cartoon!,163
16012,GEORGE," But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!",163
16013,JERRY, He looks like a Peanuts character.,163
16014,GEORGE," I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.",163
16015,JERRY, You can do that.,163
16016,GEORGE, Without his shirt on.,163
16017,JERRY," You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.",163
16018,GEORGE, It seemed so disorganized.,163
16019,JERRY, I understand.,163
16020,GEORGE," What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.",163
16021,JERRY," True. You mean, for you?",163
16022,GEORGE, I think.,163
16023,JERRY, What about your sea sickness?,163
16024,GEORGE, Maybe I could be a land guy.,163
16025,JERRY, I don't know if they have land guys.,163
16026,GEORGE, Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!,163
16027,ELAINE, Pliers?,163
16028,JERRY, Drawer.,163
16029,ELAINE, Got it.,163
16030,JERRY, What are they for?,163
16031,ELAINE, I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.,163
16032,JERRY, Come again?,163
16033,ELAINE," Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.",163
16034,GEORGE, I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?,163
16035,JERRY," Eh, it went okay.",163
16036,GEORGE," Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?",163
16037,JERRY," Yeah, I started out real classy...",163
16038,GEORGE," Yeah you did, you classed it up!",163
16039,JERRY, But then I found out about the skin cancer.,163
16040,GEORGE," Oh, so it backfired?",163
16041,JERRY, Yeah.,163
16042,GEORGE," So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.",163
16043,ELAINE," Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.",163
16044,JERRY," Sadly, that knowledge could've help me.",163
16045,GEORGE," Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?",163
16046,ELAINE, Aha.,163
16047,GEORGE, Could she do that at Kruger?,163
16048,ELAINE," I don't know, I guess.",163
16049,GEORGE," So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.",163
16050,ELAINE, You have a little thing for this fella'?,163
16051,GEORGE," Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.",163
16052,JERRY, Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!,163
16053,GEORGE," And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..",163
16054,JERRY, Must I?,163
16055,GEORGE," Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.",163
16056,JERRY, How does that reflect me?,163
16057,KRAMER," Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.",163
16058,ELAINE," Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.",163
16059,KRAMER," Ok, I'll go with you.",163
16060,ELAINE," Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.",163
16061,KRAMER," Oh, well you have fun... oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.",163
16062,JERRY," So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...",163
16063,JERRY, Was it pimple popper MD?,163
16064,JERRY, Still got it.,163
16065,ELAINE," Out, damn heal!",163
16066,KRAMER, Elaine?,163
16067,ELAINE, Kramer?,163
16068,KRAMER," Yeah listen, I need my slicer back.",163
16069,ELAINE, Just hold on!,163
16070,KRAMER," Hey, what's going on?",163
16071,ELAINE," Nothing... Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...",163
16072,KRAMER," My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!",163
16073,ELAINE, Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!,163
16074,KRAMER," Come on, this is important! ",163
16075,KRAMER," Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.",163
16076,KRAMER," So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.",163
16077,JERRY, What the hell is this?,163
16078,KRAMER," Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?",163
16079,JERRY, No.,163
16080,KRAMER," Well, what have you been doing?",163
16081,JERRY," Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...",163
16082,KRAMER," Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?",163
16083,JERRY," Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...",163
16084,KRAMER," There, there's your hives.",163
16085,JERRY," What, she gave me hives?",163
16086,KRAMER," Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.",163
16087,JERRY, She did kind of touch my face.,163
16088,KRAMER," Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.",163
16089,JERRY, It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.,163
16090,KRAMER," Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.",163
16091,ELAINE," Oh, that's fantastic.",163
16092,GEORGE," I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.",163
16093,GEORGE," His personal file, I, I don't ask...",163
16094,JERRY," I don't know, this? ",163
16095,JERRY, Where do you suppose that could've come from?,163
16096,GEORGE," Jerry, what are you doing...",163
16097,KRAMER, He is just setting the record straight.,163
16098,JERRY," Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?",163
16099,JERRY," I want the antidote, pimple popper!",163
16100,JERRY, Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!,163
16101,GEORGE," Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry!",163
16102,GEORGE," Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.",163
16103,KRAMER," Doc, huh?",163
16104,GEORGE," Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.",163
16105,KRAMER," Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin.",163
16106,GEORGE," And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.",163
16107,KRAMER," You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?",163
16108,GEORGE," Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...",163
16109,ELAINE, This is it. I can take this anymore.,163
16110,KRAMER," Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.",163
16111,KRAMER," Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.",163
16112,KRAMER," Oh, so far, so good... yeuye...",163
16113,GEORGE," Kramer, I really owe you one.",163
16114,KRAMER," George, we got a problem.",163
16115,GEORGE, What?,163
16116,KRAMER," Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.",163
16117,GEORGE," So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.",163
16118,KRAMER," George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?",163
16119,GEORGE," Because, you're not a dermatologist.",163
16120,KRAMER, He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...,163
16121,GEORGE," Whoa, whoa, a section?!",163
16122,KRAMER," Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...",163
16123,GEORGE," No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...",163
16124,KRAMER," It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.",163
16125,GEORGE, No! Absolutely Not!,163
16126,KRAMER," Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.",163
16127,ELAINE," Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!",163
16128,ELAINE," I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!",163
16129,ELAINE," Yeah, the address is 78th West...",163
16130,JERRY," So, Kramer pulled it off?",163
16131,GEORGE," Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.",163
16132,JERRY," Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!",163
16133,GEORGE, Why don't you see someone about it?,163
16134,JERRY, I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town?  A real dermatologist.,163
16135,KRAMER,  Squamous cell carcinoma.,163
16136,GEORGE, You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.,163
16137,KRAMER," George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.",163
16138,GEORGE," You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.",163
16139,KRAMER, I don't want this on my conscience.,163
16140,GEORGE, I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.,163
16141,KRAMER," Yeah, alright...",163
16142,JERRY," Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.",163
16143,KRAMER," They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.",163
16144,JERRY," Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.",163
16145,KRAMER," Well, that's weird.",163
16146,JERRY, What are you doing?,163
16147,KRAMER," Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.",163
16148,JERRY," That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!",163
16149,KRAMER," So, somehow the Bronzo  is reacting to the poison she's giving you.",163
16150,JERRY," Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you ",163
16151,KRAMER," Ohh, that's toxic.  Ououou....",163
16152,GEORGE," Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.",163
16153,GEORGE," Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.",163
16154,GEORGE, Whatever.,163
16155,GEORGE," Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!",163
16156,GEORGE, That's what they tell me!,163
16157,KRAMER, Do you want more pastrami?,163
16158,ELAINE," Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.",163
16159,KRAMER," Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?",163
16160,JERRY, I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.,163
16161,GEORGE," He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?",163
16162,JERRY," Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.",163
16163,GEORGE, What did he give you for it.,163
16164,JERRY, Aloe. So where's that lock smith?,163
16165,GEORGE, Have to give him time on this hour.,163
16166,ELAINE, Can I have a zip? ,163
16167,KRAMER," Oh yeah, coming up...",163
16168,GEORGE," So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!",164
16169,ELAINE,"  George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.",164
16170,GEORGE,  Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.,164
16171,JERRY,"  Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.",164
16172,GEORGE," Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!",164
16173,JERRY,  I said I was sorry.,164
16174,GEORGE," You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!",164
16175,JERRY,  Would you please stop saying that?!,164
16176,KRAMER,  What is up with you two?,164
16177,GEORGE, I don't want to talk about it.,164
16178,KRAMER,  So how was the big trip?,164
16179,JERRY, I don't want to talk about it!,164
16180,KRAMER,"  Well, what happened to your nose?",164
16181,ELAINE, I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! ,164
16182,KRAMER," Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?",164
16183,ELAINE, She.. was.,164
16184,JERRY, 'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.,164
16185,KRAMER,"  Ooohh... That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. ",164
16186,GEORGE,"  You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.",164

16425,JERRY," Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.",164

16427,JERRY, Why?,164
16428,GEORGE," In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!",164
16429,JERRY," So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?",164
16430,GEORGE, In every situation. No matter how silly I look.  Hm.. tastes a little funky.,164

16476,JERRY, Hey.,165
16477,ELAINE,  'Kay.,165
16478,JERRY, Back together?,165
16479,ELAINE," His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.",165
16480,JERRY, Ah...,165
16481,ELAINE, So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.,165
16482,GEORGE, 'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?,165
16483,ELAINE, He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.,165
16484,JERRY, Why now?,165
16485,ELAINE, A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.,165
16486,GEORGE, Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.,165
16487,JERRY, Still with the neck hole?,165
16488,GEORGE, Still upset. Very upset.,165
16489,ELAINE, What neck hole?,165
16490,GEORGE," Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.",165
16491,GEORGE, I asked if I could borrow a sweater.,165
16492,JERRY, A cashmere sweater.,165
16493,GEORGE," I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'",165
16494,ELAINE, Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!,165
16495,GEORGE," Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!",165
16496,ELAINE," Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?",165
16497,JERRY," No, I think the head does most of the stretching.",165
16498,GEORGE," Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.",165
16499,ELAINE, I really think it's the size of your neck.,165
16500,GEORGE, It's my head!,165
16501,ELAINE, Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!,165
16502,ELAINE, Hey.,165
16503,ELAINE," Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.",165
16504,KRAMER," You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.",165
16505,JERRY, That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?,165
16506,KRAMER, Showering. How long does it take you?,165
16507,JERRY, Ten minutes.,165
16508,KRAMER,"  Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?",165
16509,ELAINE, Ten minutes.,165
16510,KRAMER, Let me smell you.,165
16511,ELAINE, All right. Whiff away.,165
16512,KRAMER,  Uh... that's not bad at all.,165
16513,ELAINE,  Hup! That's it.,165
16514,KRAMER,  OK.,165
16515,ELAINE," So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.",165
16516,JERRY, So?,165
16517,ELAINE," So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?",165
16518,JERRY,"  I think the damage is probably already done.  All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.",165
16519,ELAINE,"  Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.",165
16520,JERRY, Mmm.,165
16521,KRAMER," Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!",165
16522,JERRY,  Zephyr? That is not a word.,165
16523,JERRY," No, I do not challenge.",165
16524,JERRY," I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.",165
16525,JERRY, Sure.,165
16526,GEORGE, So she coughed.,165
16527,JERRY," Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man.",165
16528,GEORGE, Everything goes with naked.,165
16529,JERRY," When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.",165
16530,GEORGE," Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?",165
16531,JERRY," But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.",165
16532,GEORGE, All right. It's grovel time.,165
16533,GEORGE," What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?",165
16534,GEORGE, Important step. Maybe the most important.,165
16535,JERRY," Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.",165
16536,KRAMER,"  Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.",165
16537,JERRY,  You got some suds over here.,165
16538,KRAMER,"  Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong.",165
16539,JERRY," Oh, come on!",165
16540,KRAMER," No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!",165
16541,JERRY, You promise you'll never come in here again?,165
16542,KRAMER,"  Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.",165
16543,JERRY,"  Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.",165
16544,KRAMER," Well, that's how cats do it.",165
16545,JERRY," But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.",165
16546,KRAMER, OK. Let's turn the water on now.,165
16547,JERRY," No, I told you, it's just a dry run.",165
16548,GEORGE,"  Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.",165
16549,JERRY, That's Step Ten?,165
16550,GEORGE," All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?",165
16551,KRAMER," Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?",165
16552,JERRY," You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer.",165
16553,KRAMER," Well, this has all been one big tease!",165
16554,ELAINE,  These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.,165
16555,GEORGE,"  Oh, hello, Hanke, others.",165
16556,GEORGE," You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.",165
16557,GEORGE, A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?,165
16558,GEORGE," Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.",165
16559,GEORGE, You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.,165
16560,KRAMER,"  Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.",165
16561,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!",165
16562,KRAMER,  You got a steak?,165
16563,JERRY, What happened to you?,165
16564,KRAMER," Ah, people in this city are crazy.",165
16565,JERRY,  Here ya go.,165
16566,KRAMER,"  Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.",165
16567,JERRY, What?,165
16568,KRAMER," Yeah, a different one.",165
16569,JERRY,  Oh!,165
16570,KRAMER, Jerry!,165
16571,JERRY, Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.,165
16572,JERRY, Please don't crouch.,165
16573,JERRY," Oh, that's bad. Especially that area.",165
16574,JERRY, Uhh...,165
16575,JERRY," Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!",165
16576,JERRY,  I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.,165
16577,ELAINE," Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?",165
16578,ELAINE," What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?",165
16579,ELAINE,"  Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.",165
16580,JERRY," Well, technically he did apologize.",165
16581,GEORGE," Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!",165
16582,JERRY," So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?",165
16583,GEORGE, That's right. I'm two in the hole!,165
16584,JERRY," Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.",165
16585,GEORGE, Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?,165
16586,JERRY, Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?,165
16587,GEORGE," Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?",165
16588,JERRY, Yeah.,165
16589,GEORGE,"  Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!",165
16590,JERRY,  Hello?,165
16591,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!",165
16592,JERRY, World War I plane?,165
16593,KRAMER," No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.",165
16594,JERRY, When are ya gettin' out?,165
16595,KRAMER," I'm not! I'll see ya later, buddy.",165
16596,ELAINE," Oh, please.",165
16597,ELAINE," Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?",165
16598,ELAINE," Yeah, let me tell you something",165
16599,GEORGE, So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?,165
16600,GEORGE," Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.",165
16601,GEORGE," Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.",165
16602,GEORGE," I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.",165
16603,GEORGE," Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.",165
16604,GEORGE," Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.",165
16605,GEORGE," Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.",165
16606,GEORGE," All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much.  By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...",165
16607,KRAMER,"  Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back.",165
16608,JERRY,"  I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.",165
16609,JERRY, I thought naked is good.,165
16610,GEORGE,  Where's Hanke?,165
16611,GEORGE, What? Rate-aholics?,165
16612,GEORGE," Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.",165
16613,GEORGE," Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!",165
16614,GEORGE, I'm losin' it!,165
16615,JERRY, He took you to Rage-aholics? Why?,165
16616,GEORGE, Probably because this whole Universe is against me!,165
16617,JERRY, You've got a little rage.,165
16618,GEORGE, I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!,165
16619,JERRY," By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.",165
16620,GEORGE, This bread has nuts in it!,165
16621,JERRY,"  Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?",165
16622,ELAINE, Chicken wing shoulder blades.,165
16623,JERRY, That's it?,165
16624,ELAINE," No, but that's one problem. Why?",165
16625,JERRY," Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--",165
16626,ELAINE, Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.,165
16627,GEORGE, Why not? It's a good look for a woman.,165
16628,ELAINE," Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.",165
16629,JERRY, So you don't think it's attractive?,165
16630,ELAINE," It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.",165
16631,GEORGE," Well, some women like it.",165
16632,ELAINE, Hmm. Sickies.,165
16633,KRAMER,"  Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.",165
16634,KRAMER," Is, uh, David Puddy there?",165
16635,KRAMER," Well, this is Kramer.",165
16636,KRAMER," Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?",165
16637,KRAMER, No. It says 'main line'.,165
16638,KRAMER, Yeah.,165
16639,KRAMER," Oh, OK. Well, thanks, buddy.",165
16640,ELAINE," Hey, Puddy.",165
16641,ELAINE, Balloon bouquet? For who?,165
16642,ELAINE," Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?",165
16643,ELAINE, I don't believe this woman.,165
16644,ELAINE, She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.,165
16645,ELAINE, Huh?,165
16646,ELAINE, What is this symbol?,165
16647,ELAINE," Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.",165
16648,ELAINE," OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.",165
16649,JERRY, So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?,165
16650,JERRY," Yes, clothes. This is normal.",165
16651,JERRY, Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.,165
16652,JERRY," Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...",165
16653,KRAMER,  So you broke up?,165
16654,JERRY," We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.",165
16655,KRAMER, Hang on.,165
16656,JERRY, So what are you up to?,165
16657,KRAMER," Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?",165
16658,JERRY," Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.",165
16659,KRAMER, No problem there.,165
16660,GEORGE," Well, I'm here. What is it?",165
16661,GEORGE,"  Well, thank you.",165
16662,GEORGE," Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.",165
16663,GEORGE," Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.",165
16664,GEORGE, I would like an apology.,165
16665,GEORGE," Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.",165
16666,ELAINE,"  Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY",165
16667,KRAMER," Well, thank you.",165
16668,ELAINE," Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.",165
16669,KRAMER, Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.,165
16670,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.",165
16671,ELAINE, This food was in the shower with you?,165
16672,KRAMER, Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed.,165
16673,GEORGE," Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?",165
16674,GEORGE, Thanks. What are you guys doin' here?,165
16675,ELAINE, Kramer.,165
16676,GEORGE, Right.,165
16677,GEORGE, Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!,165
16678,GEORGE, That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.,165
16679,GEORGE, It wasn't funny.,165
16680,GEORGE," He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!",165
16681,ELAINE," So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?",166
16682,JERRY," Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.",166
16683,JERRY," Hey, Tim. Great party.",166
16684,ELAINE,  eh.,166
16685,GEORGE," Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. ",166
16686,ELAINE, This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.,166
16687,GEORGE, I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. ,166
16688,ELAINE, Oh..  I got denim vest checking me out.  Fake phone number's coming out tonight.,166
16689,JERRY, You have a standard fake?,166
16690,ELAINE, Mm-hmm.,166
16691,JERRY,  That's neat.,166
16692,ELAINE,"  No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! ",166
16693,JERRY," Hi, I'm Jerry.",166
16694,ELAINE, Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons,166
16695,ELAINE, Why don't I give you my phone number?,166
16696,GEORGE, Hey.,166
16697,JERRY, Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?,166
16698,GEORGE, Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.,166
16699,JERRY, Didn't you call in sick yesterday?,166
16700,GEORGE," Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing",166
16701,JERRY,  You're gonna open your mail here?,166
16702,GEORGE," Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this.  ""Have you seen me?""  Nope.  Woah, something from Whatley.",166
16703,JERRY," See? You give, and you get.",166
16704,GEORGE,"  ""This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance.""?",166
16705,JERRY," Oh, that's nice.",166
16706,GEORGE," I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying ""I've given your gift to someone else!""",166
16707,JERRY, To a children's charity!,166
16708,GEORGE, Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!,166
16709,ELAINE, Hey!,166
16710,JERRY, Hey.,166
16711,ELAINE,"  Oh, nothing for me.  I'm going to ""Atomic Sub"" later.",166
16712,JERRY," ""Atomic Sub""? Why are you eating there?",166
16713,ELAINE," I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine  captain.",166
16714,JERRY, What does that mean?,166
16715,ELAINE,  Free sub.,166
16716,ELAINE, What?,166
16717,GEORGE, Nothing. It's a card from my dad.,166
16718,ELAINE," What is it?  ""Dear son, Happy Festivus."" What is Festivus?",166
16719,GEORGE," It's nothing, stop it..",166
16720,JERRY, When George was growing up..,166
16721,GEORGE,"  Jerry, No!",166
16722,JERRY, His father..,166
16723,GEORGE, No!,166
16724,JERRY," Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.",166
16725,ELAINE, Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.,166
16726,GEORGE,  Alright..,166
16727,JERRY," And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?",166
16728,GEORGE, Jerry! Stop it!,166
16729,JERRY, And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?,166
16730,GEORGE, I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! ,166
16731,ELAINE," Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my ""Atomic Sub"" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!",166
16732,JERRY, So?,166
16733,ELAINE," I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!",166
16734,JERRY," No, you walk out.",166
16735,ELAINE," Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.",166
16736,JERRY," No, you wait for the movie!",166
16737,ELAINE,  I want that free sub.,166
16738,JERRY," You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized!  They're cloning sheep now.",166
16739,KRAMER,"  No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!",166
16740,JERRY," So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?",166
16741,ELAINE, That's a good idea.,166
16742,KRAMER,"  Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye.  Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.",166
16743,JERRY, What strike?,166
16744,KRAMER," Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked.",166
16745,JERRY, You?,166
16746,ELAINE, Worked?,166
16747,JERRY, Bagels?,166
16748,KRAMER," Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card.  Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.",166
16749,ELAINE," Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.",166
16750,KRAMER," Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.",166
16751,ELAINE, What were your.. demands?,166
16752,KRAMER," Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.",166
16753,ELAINE, I believe that's the new minimum wage.,166
16754,KRAMER," Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. ",166
16755,JERRY, Why didn't you ever mention this?,166
16756,KRAMER," Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing!  ",166
16757,KRAMER," All right, everybody! I'm back!",166
16758,KRAMER, Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over.,166
16759,KRAMER, Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?,166
16760,KRAMER," Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..",166
16761,KRAMER," Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel!  What are those?",166
16762,KRAMER,  I never thought I'd live to see that..,166
16763,ELAINE," So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.",166
16764,ELAINE," So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..",166
16765,ELAINE, Ohh.. my..,166
16766,ELAINE," My number? Ohh..  Okay.. Uh, well, there you go.  And, uh, tell you what..  put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.",166
16767,JERRY," Hey, Tim.",166
16768,JERRY," Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.",166
16769,JERRY, Gwen?,166
16770,JERRY,  Really?,166
16771,GEORGE," So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?",166
16772,JERRY, Have you come across this?,166
16773,GEORGE," Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.",166
16774,JERRY,  Like the Batman villain?,166
16775,GEORGE,  If that helps you..,166
16776,JERRY," So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up",166
16777,GEORGE,  Clint Eastwood!,166
16778,JERRY, Yeah.,166
16779,GEORGE," Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. ",166
16780,JERRY,"  ""A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund."" - What is that?",166
16781,GEORGE,  Made it up.,166
16782,JERRY,"  ""The Human Fund. Money for people.""",166
16783,GEORGE, What do you think?,166
16784,JERRY, It has a certain understated stupidity.,166
16785,GEORGE,  The Outlaw of Josey Whales!,166
16786,JERRY, ..Yeah.,166
16787,KRAMER," Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!",166
16788,JERRY, How was your first day?,166
16789,KRAMER," Oh, fantastic!  It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.",166
16790,JERRY, Your hands were in the dough?,166
16791,KRAMER," No, I didn't make these bagels.  Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them.  Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.",166
16792,GEORGE," Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. ",166
16793,JERRY, Happy Festivus!,166
16794,KRAMER, What's Festivus?,166
16795,JERRY, When George was growing up..,166
16796,GEORGE,  No!,166
16797,JERRY, His father..,166
16798,GEORGE, Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!,166
16799,ELAINE," Happy Festivus, Georgie.",166
16800,KRAMER, Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!,166
16801,ELAINE," Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.",166
16802,JERRY, You're still trying to gget that free sub?,166
16803,ELAINE," Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.",166
16804,JERRY, Is there a captain's hat involved in this?,166
16805,ELAINE, Maybe.,166
16806,KRAMER," Well, just tell me everything, huh?",166
16807,KRAMER, What happened to the doll?,166
16808,KRAMER, That musta been some kind of doll.,166
16809,GEORGE," Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas!  Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. ",166
16810,GEORGE," Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! ",166
16811,GEORGE," Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! ",166
16812,GEORGE, The Human Fund.,166
16813,GEORGE, Exactly.  Erica!,166
16814,KRAMER, Is there a tree?,166
16815,KRAMER," Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.",166
16816,ELAINE," Hello, Frank.",166
16817,ELAINE, Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest?,166
16818,KRAMER," No.  Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.",166
16819,KRAMER, But it's Festivus.,166
16820,KRAMER, You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..,166
16821,KRAMER," Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine.  It's a walk out!",166
16822,ELAINE," No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.",166
16823,KRAMER, What? You're siding with management?!,166
16824,ELAINE," No, I just..",166
16825,KRAMER,  Scab! Scab!  Scab!,166
16826,JERRY," Boy, am I glad to see you.",166
16827,JERRY, You never know.,166
16828,JERRY," So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?",166
16829,JERRY,  You're telling me.,166
16830,GEORGE," So, she was switching? Back and forth?",166
16831,JERRY," Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.",166
16832,GEORGE," So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.",166
16833,JERRY," I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?",166
16834,GEORGE, Lights out.,166
16835,JERRY," Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.",166
16836,GEORGE,"  Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!",166
16837,JERRY," That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.",166
16838,GEORGE, I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.,166
16839,JERRY," Oh, that's classy.",166
16840,KRAMER," Well, Happy Festivus.",166
16841,GEORGE, What is that? Is taht the pole?!,166
16842,GEORGE,  That's why I hate it.,166
16843,KRAMER, There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.,166
16844,GEORGE,  I can't read it. I need my glasses!,166
16845,GEORGE, No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength!  I hate Festivus!,166
16846,JERRY," I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.",166
16847,KRAMER,  Hello.,166
16848,JERRY," Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up.  Now this is a good looking booth.",166
16849,KRAMER," Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, ",166
16850,ELAINE,"  I want the one that I earned.  I'll get it. I'll get it!  H&H, and Elaine.",166
16851,KRAMER,"  Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.",166
16852,ELAINE, What did you do?,166
16853,KRAMER, You've been warned.,166
16854,ELAINE," Oh, hi! ",166
16855,KRAMER, Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!,166
16856,GEORGE, 20 thousand dollars?,166
16857,JERRY, Why? It's our place.,166
16858,JERRY, Oh.. I know who's cooking today!,166
16859,GEORGE," Hey! Surprise, surprise!",166
16860,JERRY," Hey, Georgie!",166
16861,JERRY, I'll be here.,166
16862,GEORGE,"  Hey, soup.",166
16863,JERRY, She didn't touch it.,166
16864,GEORGE," Ohh.. Paco!  Hey, take a look at this. ",166
16865,JERRY, 20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.,166
16866,GEORGE, I don't know.,166
16867,JERRY, Excuse me?,166
16868,GEORGE, I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.,166
16869,JERRY, You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.,166
16870,GEORGE, I'm serious.,166
16871,JERRY, You're going to start your own charity?,166
16872,GEORGE," I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time!  .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..",166
16873,ELAINE," Kramer, the vest just called.",166
16874,KRAMER,  Yama - Hama! It's fright night!,166
16875,ELAINE," Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that ""Atomic Sub"" card.",166
16876,KRAMER, And?,166
16877,ELAINE,  Free sub.  I'll see ya.,166
16878,KRAMER, Yeah.,166
16879,KRAMER," Oh, hello.",166
16880,KRAMER, Ah-huh.,166
16881,KRAMER," Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.",166
16882,KRAMER," Oh, he's a tomcat.",166
16883,ELAINE, Steve.,166
16884,ELAINE, It's Elaine.,166
16885,ELAINE, Yeah.,166
16886,ELAINE, I see you're still sticking with the denim.  Do you have that card that I gave you?,166
16887,ELAINE," No, no, no. You give me your number.",166
16888,ELAINE, No.,166
16889,ELAINE, No.,166
16890,ELAINE, A fake number! Blimey!,166
16891,GEORGE," Well, there could be.",166
16892,GEORGE," Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. ",166
16893,GEORGE," Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.",166
16894,GEORGE," Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!",166
16895,GEORGE," Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.",166
16896,GEORGE, Happy Festivus!,166
16897,GEORGE," Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.",166
16898,GEORGE," Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.",166
16899,GEORGE, Happy Festivus!  Yama - Hama!,166
16900,ELAINE, I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?,166
16901,GEORGE, Embracing my roots.,166
16902,JERRY, They nailed you on the 20 G's?,166
16903,GEORGE, Busted cold.,166
16904,KRAMER," Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone!  Hee, hee, hee!",166
16905,ELAINE, What are you doing here?,166
16906,KRAMER,  I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!,166
16907,KRAMER, Uh.. that's right.,166
16908,GEORGE," Oh, God.",166
16909,JERRY, Gwen! How'd you know I was here?,166
16910,KRAMER, Another Festivus miracle!,166
16911,ELAINE," Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.",166
16912,JERRY," Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah!  Bad lighting on the porch.",166
16913,ELAINE,"  Hey, how'd my horse do?",166
16914,GEORGE, Not the feats of strength..,166
16915,KRAMER," Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.",166
16916,JERRY, I thought you were on strike?,166
16917,KRAMER," Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little  out there.",166
16918,GEORGE, Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?,166
16919,GEORGE," Oh, please, somebody, stop this!",166
16920,GEORGE," Oh, come on! Be sensible.",166
16921,GEORGE," Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!",166
16922,KRAMER, Thank - you! ,166
16923,ELAINE, Thank you. Ow!,168
16924,ELAINE, I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.,168
16925,ELAINE," I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?",168
16926,ELAINE, A fur?,168
16927,ELAINE, A seemingly infinite supply.,168
16928,ELAINE," Ow! Careful, it's hot.",168
16929,JERRY," So, Puddy wear's a man fur?",168
16930,ELAINE, He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.,168
16931,JERRY," And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.",168
16932,ELAINE," Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.",168
16933,GEORGE, And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?,168
16934,ELAINE, We never dated in winter.,168
16935,JERRY, You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.,168
16936,ELAINE," Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.",168
16937,GEORGE," An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.",168
16938,JERRY, Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.,168
16939,GEORGE," All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.",168
16940,JERRY, Cheapness is not a sense.,168
16941,ELAINE," I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...",168
16942,JERRY, I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.,168
16943,KRAMER, Hey.,168
16944,JERRY, Hey.,168
16945,KRAMER, You got any pliers?,168
16946,JERRY," What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?",168
16947,KRAMER, Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.,168
16948,ELAINE, Why?,168
16949,KRAMER," Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.",168
16950,JERRY, But then anyone can just look in and see you.,168
16951,KRAMER," Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'",168
16952,ELAINE, I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.,168
16953,JERRY," Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.",168
16954,KRAMER, Mmm... Nice wallet.,168
16955,JERRY, What?,168
16956,KRAMER," Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.",168
16957,JERRY, That's a five.,168
16958,KRAMER," I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio...",168
16959,KRAMER," Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.",168
16960,KRAMER," Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?",168
16961,KRAMER," Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.",168
16962,KRAMER," Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--",168
16963,KRAMER," Well, yeah.",168
16964,GEORGE," Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.",168
16965,JERRY, Except the store's in Delaware.,168
16966,GEORGE, I'll have 'em overnight it.,168
16967,JERRY, Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.,168
16968,GEORGE, It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.,168
16969,JERRY, Why?,168
16970,GEORGE," Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.",168
16971,JERRY, But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.,168
16972,GEORGE, I need everything in there.,168
16973,JERRY, Irish money?,168
16974,GEORGE, I might go there.,168
16975,JERRY, Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.,168
16976,GEORGE," All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.",168
16977,KRAMER, Who is it?,168
16978,KRAMER, What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.,168
16979,KRAMER, What? What are you talking about?,168
16980,KRAMER," No. No, he can't do that.",168
16981,KRAMER," Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.",168
16982,JERRY," George, I am loving this no wallet thing.",168
16983,GEORGE, A man carries a wallet.,168
16984,JERRY," You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.",168
16985,JERRY," Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place.",168
16986,GEORGE, Love to.,168
16987,JERRY, Music?,168
16988,JERRY, But I could do that and the music.,168
16989,JERRY, I was ready to get jiggy with it.,168
16990,JERRY," Hey, Elaine.",168
16991,ELAINE, Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.,168
16992,JERRY," So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?",168
16993,ELAINE," So, George... did you get the chair?",168
16994,GEORGE," No, I don't have it yet.",168
16995,JERRY," So, we're givin' him nothing?",168
16996,GEORGE," No, I brought a picture of the chair.",168
16997,JERRY, Did you at least get him a card?,168
16998,GEORGE, I thought we'd all sign the picture.,168
16999,ELAINE," Hey, Joe Mayo.",168
17000,ELAINE," Oh, fantastic.",168
17001,JERRY," Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?",168
17002,JERRY,  It's working.  Don't tap on the glass.,168
17003,GEORGE,  Joe Mayo's apartment?,168
17004,ELAINE," Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.",168
17005,KRAMER," Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.",168
17006,KRAMER," Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?",168
17007,KRAMER," Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.",168
17008,KRAMER, All right.,168
17009,KRAMER," Well, you won't regret it.",168
17010,ELAINE, Good working with you.,168
17011,ELAINE, What?,168
17012,ELAINE, Oh. Uhhh...,168
17013,ELAINE, So Joe Mayo had the same coat.,168
17014,GEORGE, And you threw it out the window?,168
17015,ELAINE, Mm-hmm.,168
17016,GEORGE," God, you're like a rock star.",168
17017,ELAINE, So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.,168
17018,JERRY, Because you threw it out.,168
17019,ELAINE," No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.",168
17020,JERRY, But you did actually throw his coat out the window.,168
17021,ELAINE," But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.",168
17022,JERRY, But that's you.,168
17023,ELAINE," So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.",168
17024,GEORGE," Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.",168
17025,JERRY, Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.,168
17026,GEORGE," This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.",168
17027,ELAINE, Look at you. You're on a slant.,168
17028,GEORGE," Here, just give me a couple of napkins.",168
17029,GEORGE," There, there I'm fine.",168
17030,JERRY, What was that?,168
17031,GEORGE, I think I had some hard candy in there.,168
17032,GEORGE," No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.",168
17033,GEORGE, Ahhh. How does this thing work?,168
17034,GEORGE,Ahhhhh...,168
17035,GEORGE, Ahhhhh...,168
17036,JERRY, All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.,168
17037,JERRY," No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?",168
17038,JERRY," Compact, lipstick, all this?",168
17039,JERRY," What are you, a medieval dungeon master?",168
17040,JERRY, Ow! Sharp key.,168
17041,KRAMER," So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?",168
17042,KRAMER," Well, why didn't you tell me about this?",168
17043,KRAMER," Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.",168
17044,KRAMER," Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.",168
17045,KRAMER," Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?",168
17046,ELAINE," So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.",168
17047,JERRY," You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.",168
17048,ELAINE, You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.,168
17049,JERRY, Not more of that crap from the Titanic?,168
17050,ELAINE, No. No. It's a small men's carryall.,168
17051,JERRY, I'm not carrying a purse.,168
17052,ELAINE, It's not a purse. It's European.,168
17053,JERRY, Oh.,168
17054,ELAINE," Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?",168
17055,JERRY, I don't know.,168
17056,ELAINE," If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.",168
17057,GEORGE, Yeah?,168
17058,JERRY," Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?",168
17059,GEORGE, Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...,168
17060,JERRY, What?,168
17061,GEORGE, It's in... transit.,168
17062,ELAINE, Did he get it?,168
17063,JERRY, No.,168
17064,ELAINE," Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.",168
17065,GEORGE,"  What, she's out?",168
17066,JERRY," Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.",168
17067,GEORGE, Allllll right!,168
17068,JERRY, What is that noise?,168
17069,GEORGE,  That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!,168
17070,JERRY," You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.",168
17071,KRAMER," Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.",168
17072,ELAINE," Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.",168
17073,KRAMER," Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.",168
17074,ELAINE, What are you talking about?,168
17075,KRAMER," Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!",168
17076,ELAINE, 88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!,168
17077,JERRY, What was that pop sound?,168
17078,KRAMER," Well, I had some hard candy in there.",168
17079,ELAINE," Come in, come in.",168
17080,ELAINE," Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.",168
17081,ELAINE, What?,168
17082,ELAINE," Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.",168
17083,ELAINE," You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.",168
17084,ELAINE," Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.",168
17085,ELAINE, Ha ha ha ha.,168
17086,ELAINE," Uh, don't worry, he's cool.",168
17087,ELAINE," Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?",168
17088,ELAINE," All right, we're done here.",168
17089,ELAINE," Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.",168
17090,JERRY, It's European.,168
17091,JERRY," Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?",168
17092,JERRY," What, he doesn't like my taste in music?",168
17093,JERRY, You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!,168
17094,KRAMER," Hey, Silvio!",168
17095,KRAMER, Huh?,168
17096,KRAMER," Relax, Silvio.",168
17097,KRAMER," Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!",168
17098,KRAMER, Yeah.,168
17099,KRAMER," Oh, lots of 'em.",168
17100,KRAMER, No.,168
17101,KRAMER, What about Jerry?,168
17102,KRAMER," Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.",168
17103,KRAMER," Yeah, something like that.",168
17104,JERRY, I have to do what?,168
17105,KRAMER, All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.,168
17106,JERRY, I'm not wearing the fur.,168
17107,KRAMER," Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.",168
17108,JERRY, Is that right?,168
17109,KRAMER," All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?",168
17110,JERRY," Newman, too?",168
17111,KRAMER," Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.",168
17112,JERRY, That's my walkman!,168
17113,KRAMER, And you'll get it back.,168
17114,JERRY, All right.,168
17115,KRAMER," All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.",168
17116,GEORGE, Hey.,168
17117,KRAMER," Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.",168
17118,JERRY," George, did you get that chair yet?",168
17119,GEORGE, It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?,168
17120,JERRY, You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.,168
17121,GEORGE, Excuse me?,168
17122,JERRY, Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.,168
17123,GEORGE," Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?",168
17124,KRAMER," Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?",168
17125,GEORGE," He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.",168
17126,KRAMER," I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.",168
17127,GEORGE," Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?",168
17128,JERRY," No, you don't have to buy anything.",168
17129,GEORGE," I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!",168
17130,JERRY, I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?,168
17131,GEORGE, I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.,168
17132,JERRY, Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!,168
17133,GEORGE," Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.",168
17134,JERRY, Your good friend is morbidly obese.,168
17135,GEORGE," Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.",168
17136,JERRY, It's not a purse. It's European!,168
17137,KRAMER," All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.",168
17138,JERRY, All right.,168
17139,KRAMER, There you go.,168
17140,JERRY, How do I look?,168
17141,KRAMER, Ahh....,168
17142,GEORGE," Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.",168
17143,GEORGE, My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!,168
17144,JERRY," Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.",168
17145,JERRY, It sure is.,168
17146,JERRY, That's true.,168
17147,KRAMER," Jerry, you forgot your purse.",168
17148,JERRY," Oh, thanks.",168
17149,KRAMER," Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.",168
17150,JERRY, Maybe this isn't my coat.,168
17151,KRAMER," All right, you're not fancy!",168
17152,ELAINE," Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.",168
17153,JERRY," No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.",168
17154,ELAINE," No, that's not your coat.",168
17155,ELAINE, It's Joe Mayo's coat.,168
17156,KRAMER, That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.,168
17157,JERRY, Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!,168
17158,JERRY," The...black, leather...thing with a strap.",168
17159,JERRY," Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!",168
17160,JERRY," So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?",168
17161,ELAINE," Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.",168
17162,JERRY, He should have had a reverse peephole.,168
17163,JERRY, Hello? Hello?,168
17164,ELAINE, What is that?,168
17165,ELAINE, You ditched the fur?,168
17166,ELAINE, You're gonna wear this all the time?,168
17167,JERRY, So your saying UNICEF is a scam?,169
17168,KRAMER, It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.,169
17169,JERRY, Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.,169
17170,KRAMER, Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?,169
17171,JERRY," No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.",169
17172,KRAMER," Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh!",169
17173,JERRY," Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.",169
17174,KRAMER, Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.,169
17175,JERRY, She should just give up.,169
17176,JERRY, Heeyyy!...,169
17177,KRAMER, Why don't you just give up?,169
17178,JERRY, Kramer!!!,169
17179,KRAMER," At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?",169
17180,JERRY, So......Susan's dead.....,169
17181,KRAMER, I think she was happy someone finally said it.,169
17182,JERRY, Why'd you have to say anything to her?,169
17183,KRAMER, 'felt that the conversation was lagging.,169
17184,JERRY, Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?,169
17185,KRAMER, I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.,169
17186,ELAINE," You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.",169
17187,JERRY, What did you wanna be?,169
17188,ELAINE," I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.",169
17189,JERRY, I don't either.,169
17190,ELAINE, And you're on the fringe of the humor business.,169
17191,GEORGE, Hey!,169
17192,ELAINE, Hey! George look at this.,169
17193,GEORGE, That's cute.,169
17194,ELAINE, You got it?,169
17195,GEORGE," No, never mind.",169
17196,ELAINE," Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.",169
17197,JERRY, It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.,169
17198,ELAINE," The cat is saying "" I've enjoyed reading your E-mail"".",169
17199,GEORGE, Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .,169
17200,ELAINE, It's a page number.,169
17201,GEORGE," Well, I can't crack this one.",169
17202,ELAINE, Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.,169
17203,GEORGE," try shaking it... Well,Janet should be here any minute.",169
17204,JERRY, You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?,169
17205,GEORGE," Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose",169
17206,ELAINE, We know what a face consists of.,169
17207,GEORGE," Jerry, Elaine, I give you.. Janet.",169
17208,ELAINE, Hi!,169
17209,GEORGE, Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.,169
17210,ELAINE," Jerry, She looks exactly like you.",169
17211,JERRY, She does not.,169
17212,ELAINE," Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.",169
17213,JERRY, Hey! Kramer.,169
17214,KRAMER," hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said ""Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.",169
17215,JERRY, What! You're the one who ruined her life.,169
17216,KRAMER, Well that's not how she remembers it.,169
17217,JERRY," Well, I got to talk her out of this.",169
17218,KRAMER, I thought you said she stinks,169
17219,JERRY, She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.,169
17220,JERRY, Yeah...,169
17221,GEORGE, Hey! George and Janet.,169
17222,KRAMER, Aahh...Who's Janet?,169
17223,JERRY," George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.",169
17224,KRAMER, You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.,169
17225,KRAMER, And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.,169
17226,GEORGE," Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry",169
17227,GEORGE," No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.",169
17228,KRAMER, C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.,169
17229,GEORGE,  All right now we're going bye bye.,169
17230,GEORGE," Well,,, it's getting dark.",169
17231,KRAMER," yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.",169
17232,JERRY, What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I,169
17233,KRAMER," Well how should I have ""broached the subject""",169
17234,JERRY," You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.",169
17235,KRAMER, Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.,169
17236,JERRY, Yeah! Because of you.,169
17237,KRAMER," Well, I think one of us should leave.",169
17238,JERRY," Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.",169
17239,JERRY," You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic.",169
17240,JERRY," Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..",169
17241,JERRY," All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.",169
17242,JERRY, NOW!!!!.... ,169
17243,ELAINE," Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.",169
17244,JERRY, Oh! I think we're at the bottom.,169
17245,ELAINE,"  Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.",169
17246,GEORGE, What does that mean?,169
17247,JERRY, Yeah. What does that mean?,169
17248,GEORGE,  What do you mean by that?,169
17249,ELAINE, Enjoy. ,169
17250,JERRY, Elaine huh?.. She's completely..,169
17251,GEORGE, Oh! I know....'Cos you don't think Janet?..,169
17252,JERRY, No....,169
17253,GEORGE, Why would I...,169
17254,JERRY, It's ludicrous..,169
17255,GEORGE, Yes.,169
17256,JERRY, For either one of us..,169
17257,GEORGE, No...,169
17258,JERRY, So...,169

17267,JERRY, Lets talk about that.,169
17268,GEORGE, Don't leave ,169
17269,KRAMER, Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry,169
17270,GEORGE, What's the decision?,169
17271,KRAMER, I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.,169
17272,JERRY, Yeah right.,169
17273,KRAMER," What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.",169
17274,GEORGE, Silence YES!!,169
17275,JERRY, Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.,169
17276,KRAMER," Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.",169
17277,JERRY, Well what does this mean?,169
17278,KRAMER, Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.,169
17279,GEORGE,"  SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...",169
17280,KRAMER, That's the idea.,169

17282,KRAMER,  ..Weeeeeepp!!,169
17283,JERRY, Oh! you just startin' now?,169

17287,ELAINE," Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?",169
17288,ELAINE, Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?,169
17289,ELAINE," But, what is the comment. ",169
17290,ELAINE, No it isn't.,169
17291,ELAINE," I don,t think so.",169
17292,ELAINE, That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?,169
17293,ELAINE, Then why did you print it.,169
17294,ELAINE,"  You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.",169
17295,ELAINE, Oh! really  well you know..... I have others,169

17298,JERRY," Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!...",169
17299,JERRY,  Oh! Shut up!!!,169
17300,ELAINE, She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.,169
17301,JERRY," Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks.",169
17302,ELAINE, Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.,169
17303,JERRY, The New Yorker?,169
17304,ELAINE," Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE....",169
17305,JERRY," Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew",169
17306,ELAINE, Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.,169
17307,JERRY, Nodding off...,169
17308,ELAINE, ....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.,169
17309,JERRY, Wow! that's incredible......But you don't draw.,169
17310,ELAINE, I do to.,169
17311,JERRY," What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... ",169
17312,ELAINE, It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.,169
17313,JERRY, Where did you see that? Those are private!!!,169
17314,JERRY," No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.",169
17315,JERRY, I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.,169
17316,JERRY, You got a little shmootz there ,169
17317,JERRY, What a surprise.,169
17318,GEORGE,"  My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry..",169
17319,GEORGE, I know....,169
17320,JERRY, There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her,169
17321,JERRY, Get Out of my House!!.,169
17322,ELAINE," Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.",169
17323,JERRY, I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.,169
17324,ELAINE, That is not the point.,169
17325,JERRY," some mouthwash, a hat, something.",169
17326,ELAINE, Just read it!,169
17327,JERRY,  Pretty good.,169
17328,ELAINE, Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it.........What? It's funny.,169
17329,JERRY, It's a pig at a complain department.,169
17330,ELAINE," And he's saying "" I wish I was taller"" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.",169
17331,JERRY, I get it.,169
17332,ELAINE, Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.,169
17333,JERRY," How 'bout if it was something like "" I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.",169
17334,ELAINE, Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.,169
17335,JERRY, I'm a comedian.,169
17336,ELAINE," I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.",169
17337,JERRY, Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.,169
17338,ELAINE," I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.",169
17339,JERRY, oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.,169
17340,ELAINE," The pig says ""my wife is a slut.""",169
17341,JERRY," Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..",169
17342,JERRY, ....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.,169
17343,JERRY,  That's it I'm calling in the big guns.,169
17344,JERRY, How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado.  ...Exactly.,169
17345,ELAINE," Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it?  Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he.",169
17346,ELAINE, Can I fix that after lunch sir?,169
17347,ELAINE,  You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.,169
17348,ELAINE, Oh! Do tell sir?,169
17349,ELAINE, A Ziggy?,169
17350,GEORGE," You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.",169
17351,GEORGE," No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.",169
17352,GEORGE, ....But after that we really talked didn't we?,169
17353,GEORGE, Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?,169
17354,GEORGE, Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.,169
17355,GEORGE, I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.,169
17356,GEORGE, I'm losin' it,169
17357,KRAMER,"  Now you gotta shut up!........I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.",169
17358,GEORGE," OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.",169
17359,GEORGE, Your hair?,169
17360,GEORGE, George is in big trouble....,169
17361,JERRY, You ripped off a Ziggy?,169
17362,ELAINE," It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?",169
17363,JERRY," I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. ""The New Yorker is stealing my ideas."" ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.",169
17364,ELAINE, Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on ,169
17365,JERRY," Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.",169
17366,JERRY, That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?,169
17367,ELAINE, Why are you yelling at the TV?,169
17368,JERRY," Elaine, have you been talking to her?",169
17369,ELAINE, Hey! I'm just a fan..ha ha...,169
17370,JERRY,  I thought you stopped talking??,169
17371,KRAMER, ...All right ..Starting now......,169
17372,JERRY, You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?,169
17373,GEORGE, like that ,169
17374,JERRY, You mean like.. ,169
17375,GEORGE, ..That.,169
17376,JERRY, So she..,169
17377,GEORGE, Yes..,169
17378,JERRY, And you don't...,169
17379,GEORGE, Nooo...,169
17380,JERRY, So...,169
17381,GEORGE, Exactly..,169
17382,JERRY, Hmmmm...,169
17383,GEORGE, We...must never ever speak of this again..,169
17384,JERRY," No, no...... Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?",169
17385,GEORGE, Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off ,169
17386,JERRY, I think that's for the best.,169
17387,JERRY," I'm not a foodie. I don't, ""Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty."" Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? ""Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.."" What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?",17
17388,ELAINE, Do you want some of mine?,17
17389,JERRY, Take some of mine.,17
17390,GEORGE," Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.",17
17391,JERRY, Who said you have to like it?,17
17392,GEORGE," Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.",17
17393,JERRY, I don't like pesto.,17
17394,GEORGE, Where was pesto 10 years ago?,17
17395,JERRY,"  Look at that guy.  I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.",17
17396,ELAINE,"  The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um..  Oh yeah, plugola.",17
17397,JERRY,"  Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.",17
17398,GEORGE, That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.,17
17399,JERRY, I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.,17
17400,GEORGE, Who?,17
17401,JERRY," Elaine is having a ""houseguest."" She's picking him up at the airport tonight.",17
17402,GEORGE, A guy?,17
17403,ELAINE,"  Yes, a guy.",17
17404,JERRY," He's from a.. Yakima, right?",17
17405,ELAINE, Seattle.,17
17406,JERRY, Everybody's moving to Seattle.,17
17407,GEORGE, It's the pesto of cities. So..?,17
17408,ELAINE,  You tell him.,17
17409,JERRY," Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.",17
17410,ELAINE, Ed.,17
17411,JERRY," Who was in town on a business venture, and um..",17
17412,ELAINE, ..We shared an interpersonal experience.  Go on.,17
17413,JERRY," So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.",17
17414,ELAINE, On some people.,17
17415,GEORGE, Oooh.,17
17416,JERRY," So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.",17
17417,ELAINE," It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.",17
17418,GEORGE," Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.",17
17419,ELAINE,  I'm never eating here again.,17
17420,JERRY,"  Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert..  I think the busboy's in trouble.",17
17421,GEORGE, Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose..  He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!,17
17422,ELAINE," I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.",17
17423,JERRY,  I didn't say anything.,17
17424,GEORGE, I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!,17
17425,ELAINE," Oh, I said it in a kidding way.",17
17426,GEORGE, I didn't know he'd get fired.,17
17427,JERRY,  He'll probably kill his family over this.,17
17428,GEORGE, What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!,17
17429,JERRY,  A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.,17
17430,GEORGE, Was it my fault?,17
17431,ELAINE, Was it my fault?,17
17432,JERRY,  ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.,17
17433,JERRY," Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.",17
17434,GEORGE,"  Oh, like you really know busboys.",17
17435,JERRY," Oh, like you do.",17
17436,GEORGE," Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.",17
17437,JERRY,  Camp.,17
17438,GEORGE, It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.,17
17439,JERRY, Elaine?,17
17440,ELAINE,  Yeah.,17
17441,JERRY, Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.,17
17442,GEORGE, Then why don't you try and get him another job?,17
17443,JERRY," I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.",17
17444,ELAINE," I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.",17
17445,GEORGE, What? Did you get the busboy's number?,17
17446,ELAINE," His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D.  Now, I did my job.  May I have the car keys, please?",17
17447,GEORGE, How did you get all this?,17
17448,ELAINE," Does the word ""charm"" mean anything to you?",17
17449,JERRY, No.  So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.,17
17450,GEORGE,  I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.,17
17451,JERRY," You, you're going now?",17
17452,GEORGE," Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.",17
17453,JERRY, Maybe the fat camp.  You're not going?,17
17454,ELAINE," I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.",17
17455,JERRY, I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?,17
17456,GEORGE, It'll take to long.,17
17457,JERRY, Take the K-man. A little support..,17
17458,GEORGE,  I don't a..,17
17459,KRAMER, Take me where? Where?,17
17460,GEORGE," Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.",17
17461,KRAMER, What am I gonna say?,17
17462,GEORGE, I don't know.,17
17463,KRAMER," Well, I'm not an idiot.",17
17464,GEORGE, Certainly not.,17
17465,KRAMER, Then we're cool.,17
17466,GEORGE," Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool.  Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened.  I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired.  And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.",17
17467,KRAMER,  He's a hell of a guy.,17
17468,GEORGE, This is a guy I know.. Kramer.,17
17469,KRAMER, ¿Habla espanol?,17
17470,GEORGE,  Oh my God.,17
17471,KRAMER, ¿Como se dice.. waterbed?,17
17472,GEORGE,"  Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that.  Well, I guess that's about it.",17
17473,KRAMER, You got anything to drink? ¿Agua?,17
17474,GEORGE, Oy uy uy..  We really should get going.,17
17475,KRAMER, Let me get a glass of water. ,17
17476,GEORGE, Hurry up.,17
17477,KRAMER, His cat's gone.,17
17478,KRAMER," ..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in",17
17479,GEORGE,"  Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat..  the lamp.",17
17480,KRAMER, The wire was sticking out..  Yeah.,17
17481,GEORGE,"  Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer..  ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. ",17
17482,KRAMER, You oughta get that wire fixed.  I got the door. ,17
17483,JERRY,"  George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.",17
17484,KRAMER, Hey.,17
17485,JERRY,  Hey.  He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?..  That's Elaine.  Kramer..  George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.,17
17486,KRAMER, It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.,17
17487,JERRY,  Kramer says it's up to the cat now.  It'll be on your conscience.,17
17488,KRAMER, Oh? How do you figure?,17
17489,JERRY,  How do you figure?  'Cause you're the one who left the door open.,17
17490,KRAMER, Why was I in charge of closing the door?,17
17491,JERRY,  Why was he in charge of closing the door?  'Cause you came in after him!,17
17492,KRAMER, So!,17
17493,JERRY,"  So!  So, the last person in should close the door!",17
17494,KRAMER, Let me talk to him.,17
17495,JERRY,  Talk - call him from your house.  He's calling you now.. okay. ,17
17496,ELAINE, Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?,17
17497,JERRY, No hello?,17
17498,ELAINE," Got any asprin?  Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?",17
17499,JERRY," Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car.",17
17500,ELAINE," Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.",17
17501,JERRY,"  So, did you have a nice week together?",17
17502,ELAINE, I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?,17
17503,JERRY, There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?,17
17504,ELAINE," Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!",17
17505,JERRY," So, you two been, uh..",17
17506,ELAINE," No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..",17
17507,JERRY, What's your airport route?,17
17508,ELAINE, I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.,17
17509,JERRY, ..What about the Van Wyck?,17
17510,ELAINE," I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.",17
17511,JERRY, Oooh.,17
17512,ELAINE," Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 10",17
17513,JERRY, You still using that old alarm clock?,17
17514,ELAINE," Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in the face.",17
17515,JERRY," Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, ""Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land.""  ""I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago?  Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second..  Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you.""",17
17516,ELAINE,  Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off!  It's 9,17
17517,ELAINE, Yes! 9,17
17518,ELAINE," Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go!  You get dressed! Get dressed!",17
17519,ELAINE, Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!,17
17520,ELAINE, Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on!  Where are you going?,17
17521,ELAINE, The kitchen?!,17
17522,ELAINE, They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!,17
17523,ELAINE, No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!,17
17524,ELAINE, Don't say that!,17
17525,ELAINE, Shut up and pack!,17
17526,ELAINE, You're talking too much!,17
17527,ELAINE, What?!,17
17528,ELAINE, What? What sweater?,17
17529,ELAINE, You didn't bring a brown sweater.,17
17530,ELAINE, Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?!  You got a brown sweater!,17
17531,ELAINE, It's brown! ,17
17532,ELAINE, NO time for folding..  I think that's it. ,17
17533,ELAINE, Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them!  I got this. Let's go!,17
17534,JERRY, Anywhere in the city?,17
17535,GEORGE, Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.,17
17536,JERRY, Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?,17
17537,GEORGE," Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.",17
17538,JERRY, Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.,17
17539,GEORGE,"  ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.",17
17540,ELAINE,"  I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.",17
17541,KRAMER, ..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!,17
17542,GEORGE, The busboy's coming?,17
17543,JERRY, You don't mean here?,17
17544,KRAMER, Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..,17
17545,GEORGE, He's coming up?!  I'll check you out later.,17
17546,JERRY, Where are you going?,17
17547,GEORGE, I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.,17
17548,JERRY,  No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.,17
17549,KRAMER," No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.",17
17550,GEORGE," Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..",17
17551,KRAMER, Antonio. In here!,17
17552,GEORGE,"  Hey, Antonio. How's it going?",17
17553,GEORGE,"  Ah, come on..",17
17554,ELAINE,  Yeah?,17
17555,ELAINE, He's coming up.  He's coming up..,17
17556,JERRY, He'll get another job. He's a busboy!,17
17557,GEORGE, It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.,17
17558,JERRY, It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.,17
17559,GEORGE, That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.,17
17560,ELAINE," Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio.  ..Thanks.",17
17561,GEORGE," So, much longer?",17
17562,ELAINE," Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?",17
17563,GEORGE,  I guess it's not important.,17
17564,ELAINE, Take care of yourselves. ,17
17565,GEORGE," I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.",17
17566,JERRY, Yeah..  How ya doing?,17
17567,JERRY," First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, ""Didn't you see my signal?"" ""Look at that fender!"" ..Then you'd see a real fight.",17
17568,GEORGE,"  Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up.",170
17569,GEORGE,  What's that?,170
17570,GEORGE,  W-we're not?,170
17571,GEORGE, All right ,170
17572,JERRY, She said no?,170
17573,GEORGE, She said no.,170
17574,JERRY, What did you do?,170
17575,GEORGE, What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!,170
17576,JERRY," George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.",170
17577,GEORGE," Well, I don't really like her.",170
17578,JERRY, That's good.,170
17579,GEORGE, I don't find her attractive.,170
17580,JERRY, Solid.,170
17581,GEORGE, I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.,170
17582,JERRY, Always popular.,170
17583,GEORGE, Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food,170
17584,JERRY, You have an airtight case!,170
17585,GEORGE, And in bed--,170
17586,JERRY, I'm afraid we're out of time.,170
17587,JERRY, Hey.,170
17588,GEORGE, What?,170
17589,JERRY," Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie ""Cinderfella"". I got 'em at an auction.",170
17590,GEORGE, I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.,170
17591,JERRY," No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.",170
17592,GEORGE, You already have an in. You have the same first name!...  'Jerry'!,170
17593,JERRY," Oh, that'll intrigue him.",170
17594,GEORGE," Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.",170
17595,JERRY, George Peppard has been dead for years.,170
17596,GEORGE," Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!",170
17597,ELAINE," Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...",170
17598,ELAINE," Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?",170
17599,ELAINE, Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?,170
17600,ELAINE," So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?",170
17601,ELAINE,  Oh  That'll do! ,170
17602,JERRY, What about Puddy?,170
17603,ELAINE," I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...",170
17604,JERRY,"  So, what's this guy about?",170
17605,ELAINE," I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.",170
17606,JERRY," Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!",170
17607,ELAINE, Which one is he?,170
17608,JERRY," Green suit, power ring.",170
17609,ELAINE, I don't care for jewellery on men ,170
17610,KRAMER, Hey. It happened again.  Another robbery in the building.,170
17611,JERRY, So you bought a cooler?,170
17612,KRAMER," No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.",170
17613,ELAINE, And... what would those be?,170
17614,KRAMER," Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.",170
17615,JERRY,  You were in the Army?,170
17616,KRAMER," Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. ",170
17617,ELAINE, Literally.,170
17618,KRAMER,  'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean?  You mind if I hide this somewhere?,170
17619,JERRY," No, go ahead.",170
17620,KRAMER,"  A little... privacy, uh?",170
17621,JERRY," Oh, come on!",170
17622,ELAINE, Oh!,170
17623,KRAMER," Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue!  Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.",170
17624,JERRY,  How long did you last? ,170
17625,KRAMER," Well, that's classified.",170
17626,ELAINE," Hey, what if he's married?",170
17627,JERRY, Kramer?!,170
17628,ELAINE," No, the Green Lantern.",170
17629,KRAMER,  OK!,170
17630,JERRY," So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.",170
17631,ELAINE," Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.",170
17632,KRAMER,  You peeked!,170
17633,JERRY, THIS is your hiding place?! ,170
17634,KRAMER, It was under a spoon!,170
17635,GEORGE," And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up.  Thank you,  and good night.",170
17636,GEORGE,  But I proved it!,170
17637,GEORGE," Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.",170
17638,GEORGE,"  Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!",170
17639,ELAINE," So, how is a guy like you not involved?",170
17640,ELAINE,"  That's true, maybe he's not married.",170
17641,ELAINE," Oh, that is so sweet.",170
17642,ELAINE,  How long do I have to hold this?,170
17643,ELAINE, Who is it?,170
17644,ELAINE,"  Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. ",170
17645,ELAINE,  Jerry! Jerry!,170
17646,JERRY," Elaine, what are you doin' down there?",170
17647,ELAINE, You didn't hear me buzzing?,170
17648,JERRY," Oh, I guess it's broken!",170
17649,ELAINE, Throw down your key.,170
17650,JERRY, It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.,170
17651,ELAINE, I'll catch it!,170
17652,JERRY, You'll chicken out at the last second.,170
17653,ELAINE," ...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?",170
17654,JERRY,"  All right.  Hey, you know what's weird?",170
17655,ELAINE, Huh?,170
17656,JERRY, I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.,170
17657,ELAINE," Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!",170
17658,JERRY, All right.,170
17659,JERRY, Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.,170
17660,ELAINE,  It went in the sewer! ,170
17661,JERRY, Hey...,170
17662,KRAMER,  What are you doin'?,170
17663,JERRY,  You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!,170
17664,KRAMER,"  You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.",170
17665,JERRY, I'm gonna go let Elaine in. ,170
17666,KRAMER," Oo, y- what are you doing with her? ",170
17667,JERRY,  Kramer!,170
17668,KRAMER,  Security issue!,170
17669,JERRY," Oh, hey. You got in.",170
17670,ELAINE," Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. ",170
17671,JERRY,"  Oh, thanks.",170
17672,KRAMER,  That wasn't me!,170
17673,JERRY," So, he's definitely married, huh?",170
17674,ELAINE, Uh...,170
17675,JERRY," Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.",170
17676,JERRY," Oh, come on!",170
17677,ELAINE," Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.",170
17678,KRAMER,  OK! ,170
17679,KRAMER," All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. ",170
17680,GEORGE,  Jerry!,170
17681,JERRY,"  George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!",170
17682,JERRY,  I believe this belongs to you.,170
17683,KRAMER, Heyyyy! ,170
17684,JERRY,  Where did you get that?,170
17685,GEORGE,  I bought it. ,170
17686,JERRY,  I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.,170
17687,JERRY, There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.,170
17688,GEORGE, Sounds like a scam. ,170
17689,JERRY,  I'm very sorry. ,170
17690,GEORGE," So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.",170
17691,JERRY," Great, you're lonely and miserable again. ",170
17692,GEORGE, Feels right. ,170
17693,JERRY, Is that guy still there? ,170
17694,GEORGE,  He's starin' at us.,170
17695,JERRY, Don't look at him. ,170
17696,JERRY, We don't hear that. ,170
17697,GEORGE, Want a bite?,170
17698,JERRY," Nooo, I don't. ",170
17699,GEORGE,"  I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. ",170
17700,GEORGE,"  What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!",170
17701,GEORGE, Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?,170
17702,GEORGE,  All right. ,170
17703,ELAINE," So, this is your little... love nest? ",170
17704,ELAINE, Oh.,170
17705,ELAINE," Oh, that sounds... romantic.",170
17706,ELAINE,  This is wrong. I should go. ,170
17707,ELAINE," Oh, sure.",170
17708,ELAINE,"  Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.",170
17709,ELAINE, This is his home?,170
17710,ELAINE," So, he's...",170
17711,JERRY, So you do live here.,170
17712,JERRY, You live on this floor?,170
17713,JERRY,  So you live right... there.,170
17714,JERRY, So I guess I'll s--,170
17715,ELAINE, He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone.  He's not married. He's poor. ,170
17716,JERRY, Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?,170
17717,ELAINE, He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.,170
17718,JERRY," So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?",170
17719,ELAINE, How can I end it over money? I feel bad.,170
17720,JERRY," Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?",170
17721,ELAINE, Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.,170
17722,JERRY, Good. How did you handle that?,170
17723,ELAINE," Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.",170
17724,JERRY," Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.",170
17725,ELAINE," Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?",170
17726,GEORGE,  Hey.,170
17727,JERRY," Hey, where have you been?",170
17728,GEORGE,"  Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.",170
17729,ELAINE," If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.",170
17730,GEORGE," Who's this, Blue Arrow?",170
17731,ELAINE, Green Lantern.,170
17732,JERRY, We found out his super power was lack of money.,170
17733,ELAINE,  All right.,170
17734,JERRY, He's invulnerable to creditors.,170
17735,ELAINE,  We get it. ,170
17736,JERRY, He's the Got-no-Green Lantern.,170
17737,ELAINE, Thank you. ,170
17738,GEORGE," Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.",170
17739,ELAINE,"  Ooh,  well crafted. ",170
17740,GEORGE," Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.",170
17741,JERRY," Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.",170
17742,GEORGE," She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.",170
17743,JERRY, ... Could you move over there?!,170
17744,GEORGE," Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.",170
17745,JERRY, Really? How come you never pursued her before?,170
17746,GEORGE," She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.",170
17747,ELAINE,  Did I leave my glasses here?,170
17748,JERRY,  He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!,170
17749,ELAINE,  Keep 'em! ,170
17750,KRAMER, Heh.,170
17751,JERRY, There's a giant parrot in the hallway.,170
17752,KRAMER, It's Phil's.,170
17753,JERRY, Who?,170
17754,KRAMER," Our neighbor that you... turned against.  Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.",170
17755,JERRY, What'd ya tell him that for?,170
17756,KRAMER," Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.",170
17757,JERRY, Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?,170
17758,KRAMER," Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...",170
17759,JERRY, He let you?,170
17760,KRAMER," No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh,  Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! ",170
17761,GEORGE," So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?",170
17762,GEORGE, Well...  heeere we are ,170
17763,GEORGE,  Ho ho! ,170
17764,GEORGE,  Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.,170
17765,GEORGE," Oh, not more building.",170
17766,GEORGE, No?,170
17767,GEORGE,  All right. ,170
17768,ELAINE," So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?",170
17769,ELAINE,  Oh.,170
17770,ELAINE, What are you doing? What is that?,170
17771,ELAINE, It's garbage.,170
17772,ELAINE,"  All right, that's it.  How do you spell your last name?",170
17773,ELAINE,  I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?,170
17774,ELAINE, Make it three hundred.,170
17775,ELAINE,"  Aw, Glenn.",170
17776,JERRY, Hi. Is Phil here?,170
17777,JERRY," Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.",170
17778,JERRY," I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.",170
17779,JERRY,"  All right, I think we're done here. ",170
17780,JERRY,"  So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.",170
17781,GEORGE, This isn't going well.,170
17782,JERRY," I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!",170
17783,GEORGE, You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name!  'Jerry'! ,170
17784,JERRY, Where are you goin'? Help me look!,170
17785,GEORGE,"  It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of ""Godspell"" with the other.",170
17786,JERRY, Which is with who?,170
17787,GEORGE,  It doesn't matter. ,170
17788,KRAMER,"  Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.",170
17789,JERRY, I can't go until I find my cufflinks.,170
17790,KRAMER," Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.",170
17791,JERRY," You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?",170
17792,KRAMER," Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?",170
17793,KRAMER," Hey, what's going on?",170
17794,JERRY, That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?,170
17795,JERRY," Oh, Phil... Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.",170
17796,JERRY," But I, I didn't, I--",170
17797,JERRY," Kramer, they think I killed Fredo!  And who buries a bird?",170
17798,KRAMER," Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.",170
17799,JERRY, Just get the key and let's get out of here.,170
17800,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.",170
17801,JERRY, Kramer!? ,170
17802,KRAMER, What?,170
17803,JERRY, You killed Fredo!,170
17804,KRAMER,"  Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!",170
17805,JERRY," Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?",170
17806,KRAMER, You just answered your own question.,170
17807,JERRY,"  Oh, no!",170
17808,KRAMER,  I'll get the shovel. ,170
17809,GEORGE," The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.",170
17810,GEORGE," I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.",170
17811,GEORGE," Maura.  Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!",170
17812,GEORGE,  Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! ,170
17813,GEORGE,"  This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives...  Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... ",170
17814,GEORGE,"  What? So, this is still not over?",170
17815,GEORGE, You?,170
17816,GEORGE, All right. ,170
17817,ELAINE," Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.",170
17818,ELAINE, Who is this?,170
17819,ELAINE, You're... poor AND married?,170
17820,ELAINE, I guess I'm... Lois Loan.,170
17821,JERRY," Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers.",170
17822,KRAMER,"  'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.",170
17823,JERRY,"  Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! ",170
17824,KRAMER,"  All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.",170
17825,JERRY,  I'll dig.,170
17826,KRAMER," Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.",170
17827,JERRY,"  Well, that was easy.",170
17828,JERRY,"  Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!",170
17829,JERRY,"  Hey, neighbor.",170
17830,GEORGE, All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each...  What do you think?,170
17831,ELAINE," Give me forty, you'll never see me again.",170
17832,ELAINE,"  So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?",170
17833,JERRY,"  Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.",170
17834,GEORGE," So, what's in the cooler? ",170
17835,KRAMER," Oh. Well, would you look at that.  I guess I forgot to lock it.",170
17836,JERRY, You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?,170
17837,KRAMER," Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!",170
17838,GEORGE, When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner?  What's that?,171
17839,JERRY, It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.,171
17840,GEORGE, How much was it?,171
17841,JERRY, Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.,171
17842,GEORGE, Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?,171
17843,JERRY," Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.",171
17844,GEORGE, I got a message from the Rosses at work today.,171
17845,JERRY, Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?,171
17846,GEORGE," At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.",171
17847,JERRY," Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.",171
17848,ELAINE,"  Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.",171
17849,ELAINE, OK.,171
17850,JERRY, Still no Puddy?,171
17851,ELAINE," Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?",171
17852,JERRY, What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?,171
17853,ELAINE, What black guy?,171
17854,JERRY," Darryl. He's black, isn't he?",171
17855,ELAINE, He is?,171
17856,GEORGE," No, he isn't.",171
17857,JERRY," Isn't he, Elaine?",171
17858,ELAINE, You think?,171
17859,GEORGE, I thought he looked Irish.,171
17860,JERRY, What's his last name?,171
17861,ELAINE, Nelson.,171
17862,GEORGE, That's not Irish.,171
17863,JERRY, I think he's black.,171
17864,GEORGE, Should we be talkin' about this?,171
17865,ELAINE, I think it's OK.,171
17866,GEORGE," No, it isn't.",171
17867,JERRY, Why not?,171
17868,GEORGE," Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.",171
17869,JERRY, If he's black.,171
17870,ELAINE, Is he black?,171
17871,JERRY, Does it matter?,171
17872,ELAINE," No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.",171
17873,JERRY," Oh, so you need to know?",171
17874,ELAINE," No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.",171
17875,JERRY,"  Uh, one second.",171
17876,ELAINE,"  Oh, here.",171
17877,GEORGE,"  Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.",171
17878,GEORGE,"  Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.",171
17879,GEORGE," George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.",171
17880,GEORGE," Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.",171
17881,GEORGE," Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.",171
17882,JERRY, House in the Hamptons?,171
17883,GEORGE," Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.",171
17884,KRAMER,  Well.,171
17885,JERRY, Hey.,171
17886,KRAMER," Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.",171
17887,JERRY, Wow. What are we celebrating?,171
17888,KRAMER," Uh, you remember my coffee table book?",171
17889,JERRY, With the little legs?,171
17890,KRAMER, That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.,171
17891,GEORGE, How are they gonna make that book into a movie?,171
17892,KRAMER, You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?,171
17893,GEORGE, Yeah?,171
17894,KRAMER, Independence Day?,171
17895,GEORGE, Oh.,171
17896,JERRY, How much are they payin' you?,171
17897,KRAMER, Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.,171
17898,JERRY, That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.,171
17899,KRAMER," Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.",171
17900,JERRY, From what?,171
17901,KRAMER," From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.",171
17902,JERRY,  What's that?,171
17903,KRAMER," Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.",171
17904,KRAMER," Well, it's not really gold.",171
17905,ELAINE,  Hey.,171
17906,ELAINE, Great music.,171
17907,ELAINE," Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?",171
17908,ELAINE, Right. African.,171
17909,ELAINE, South Africa.,171
17910,ELAINE, Maybe.,171
17911,GEORGE,"  You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.",171
17912,GEORGE," I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.",171
17913,GEORGE, Mmm... no.,171
17914,JERRY, It's 5,171
17915,JERRY,"  Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.",171
17916,JERRY, What does that mean?,171
17917,JERRY, Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.,171
17918,JERRY," Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.",171
17919,JERRY, Could be.,171
17920,JERRY," And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.",171
17921,JERRY," Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.",171
17922,KRAMER,"  Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?",171
17923,JERRY," Kramer, what are you doing here?",171
17924,KRAMER, I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.,171
17925,KRAMER," Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.",171
17926,JERRY," Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.",171
17927,JERRY,  Not you. Older people.,171
17928,KRAMER," Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom.",171
17929,JERRY," If you feed him, he'll never leave.",171
17930,KRAMER,  I guess.,171
17931,JERRY, I can't believe this.,171
17932,KRAMER," I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?",171
17933,ELAINE," So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?",171
17934,GEORGE," Actually, I did have a thought.",171
17935,ELAINE, Oh.,171
17936,GEORGE, Why don't you just ask him?,171
17937,ELAINE,"  Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.",171
17938,GEORGE," Maybe he's, um... mixed.",171
17939,ELAINE, Is that the right word?,171
17940,GEORGE, I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.,171
17941,ELAINE, Yeah.,171
17942,GEORGE,  I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.,171
17943,ELAINE,"  You know what, I'm leavin'.",171
17944,GEORGE, Yeah.,171
17945,ELAINE," I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back.  Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.",171
17946,ELAINE,"  The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.",171
17947,GEORGE, Rosses.,171
17948,GEORGE," Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.",171
17949,GEORGE," Yeah, I may move out there.  I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!",171
17950,JERRY," Dad, it's got lots of other functions.",171
17951,JERRY,"  Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.",171
17952,JERRY," Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.",171
17953,JERRY, What press?,171
17954,JERRY, She's fifty.,171
17955,KRAMER," All right, I'll see you guys.",171
17956,KRAMER, Yeah.,171
17957,KRAMER,"  Morty, what're you lookin' at?",171
17958,KRAMER, Hmm.,171
17959,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...",171
17960,ELAINE," It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one",171
17961,ELAINE, It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.,171
17962,ELAINE, What?,171
17963,ELAINE, laughing awkwardly,171
17964,ELAINE, Really?,171
17965,ELAINE," No, but... it is very nice to know.",171
17966,JERRY,  So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.,171
17967,ELAINE,"  Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.",171
17968,JERRY,  You're a master of race relations.,171
17969,ELAINE," Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?",171
17970,JERRY," Yeah, it's all my father's doing.",171
17971,JERRY, He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.,171
17972,ELAINE," Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?",171
17973,JERRY, Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.,171
17974,GEORGE,  Jerry?,171
17975,ELAINE,  He's still down with his folks.,171
17976,GEORGE,  What are you doin' here?,171
17977,JERRY, (overhearing the other two,171
17978,ELAINE,  I'm gettin' his mail.,171
17979,JERRY,"  Oh, no.",171
17980,GEORGE,  He asked you to get the mail?,171
17981,ELAINE,  Mm-hmm.,171
17982,GEORGE,"  Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?",171
17983,JERRY," George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.",171
17984,ELAINE,  What?,171
17985,GEORGE, What about the mail?,171
17986,JERRY," This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.",171
17987,GEORGE,"  All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.",171
17988,GEORGE," So, I ran into the Rosses again.",171
17989,ELAINE," Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?",171
17990,GEORGE, From me.,171
17991,ELAINE, What did you say?,171
17992,GEORGE, I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?,171
17993,ELAINE, I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.,171
17994,GEORGE," So, they knew? Those liars!",171
17995,ELAINE, But you lied first.,171
17996,GEORGE," Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!",171
17997,ELAINE, Like you're a liar!,171
17998,GEORGE, Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?,171
17999,ELAINE," So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.",171
18000,GEORGE," Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.",171
18001,ELAINE, Haven't you done enough to these people?,171
18002,GEORGE," This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.",171
18003,KRAMER,"  Vote for Kramer.  Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks.  Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.",171
18004,KRAMER, Gladly.,171
18005,ELAINE, What?,171
18006,ELAINE, Interracial? Us?,171
18007,ELAINE," Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!",171
18008,ELAINE," Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club.",171
18009,GEORGE, So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.,171
18010,GEORGE, Do you have your bathing suits?,171
18011,GEORGE," Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!",171
18012,JERRY,"  Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin.  Dad, you look so different.",171
18013,KRAMER," Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.",171
18014,KRAMER," Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.",171
18015,JERRY," You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.",171
18016,KRAMER,"  Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh?  Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.",171
18017,KRAMER," Well, I couldn't find my shoes.",171
18018,JERRY," Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.",171
18019,KRAMER," Oh, yeah! Me.",171
18020,KRAMER," All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?",171
18021,JERRY, Wizards!,171
18022,KRAMER," Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.",171
18023,JERRY, Kramer...,171
18024,KRAMER," Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?",171
18025,JERRY," Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.",171
18026,KRAMER," Well, what about your deal, huh?",171
18027,JERRY, I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?,171
18028,KRAMER," Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.",171
18029,JERRY, Down here?,171
18030,KRAMER," Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father.",171
18031,GEORGE, You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.,171
18032,GEORGE," Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?",171
18033,GEORGE, Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?,171
18034,GEORGE,"  Housewarming gift.  All right, we're taking it up a notch!",171
18035,ELAINE,  Long day?,171
18036,ELAINE," I hear ya, Sister.",171
18037,ELAINE,  Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?,171
18038,ELAINE, Hey.,171
18039,ELAINE, Yeah.,171
18040,ELAINE, Aren't you?,171
18041,ELAINE, You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.,171
18042,ELAINE, I am?,171
18043,ELAINE, No. Why would you think that?,171
18044,ELAINE, That's because I thought you were black.,171
18045,ELAINE, I don't think we should be talking about this.,171
18046,ELAINE, I'm white.,171
18047,ELAINE, I guess.,171
18048,ELAINE, Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?,171
18049,KRAMER,"  Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.",171
18050,JERRY, Aw.,171
18051,KRAMER," Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master.",171
18052,JERRY," A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!",171
18053,JERRY, Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.,171
18054,JERRY, No deal. Not hot.,171
18055,KRAMER, What?,171
18056,KRAMER,"  Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.",171
18057,JERRY," Dad, I'm sorry.",171
18058,JERRY, It does other things!,171
18059,GEORGE, Almost there.,171
18060,GEORGE," We, uh, we go on foot from here.",171
18061,GEORGE, There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.,171
18062,GEORGE," Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?",171
18063,GEORGE, Oh.,171
18064,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah.",172
18065,ELAINE, Goodbye?,172
18066,ELAINE, Okay.,172
18067,ELAINE, I won't.,172
18068,ELAINE, Jesus?,172
18069,GEORGE," Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.",172
18070,GEORGE," Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. ""Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger.""",172
18071,GEORGE," I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.",172
18072,JERRY, And then?,172
18073,GEORGE, I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.,172
18074,JERRY," Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.",172
18075,GEORGE, I can't just leave.,172
18076,JERRY, That's the way they do it in Vegas.,172
18077,GEORGE, You never played Vegas.,172
18078,JERRY, I hear things.,172
18079,ELAINE, Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.,172
18080,GEORGE, I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.,172
18081,ELAINE," So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?",172
18082,JERRY," It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.",172
18083,ELAINE," Yes, he is lazy.",172
18084,JERRY, Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.,172
18085,ELAINE," Yes, he is dumb.",172
18086,JERRY, So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?,172
18087,ELAINE," Dumb and lazy, I understand.",172
18088,GEORGE, Tell you how you could check.,172
18089,ELAINE, How?,172
18090,GEORGE," Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.",172
18091,JERRY," No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.",172
18092,GEORGE," No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.",172
18093,JERRY," Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.",172
18094,GEORGE, Well that's the gist of it!,172
18095,ELAINE, Quiet! So where is this Sophie?,172
18096,JERRY," Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.",172
18097,ELAINE, How long have you two been together?,172
18098,JERRY," I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?",172
18099,GEORGE," By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?",172
18100,ELAINE, I needed to move a bureau.,172
18101,KRAMER," Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?",172
18102,JERRY, Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.,172
18103,KRAMER," Yeah.  See? It should sound like that, something like that.",172
18104,KRAMER," A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.",172
18105,JERRY, What's with the fake sneezing?,172
18106,KRAMER," Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.",172
18107,JERRY, Do medical schools actually do this?,172
18108,KRAMER," Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.",172
18109,JERRY, I think the phone is ringing.,172
18110,JERRY," Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?",172
18111,KRAMER," Mickey, DTs.",172
18112,JERRY, Hello?,172
18113,JERRY, Elaine?,172
18114,JERRY, George??,172
18115,JERRY," Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.",172
18116,KRAMER, You got any Ipecac?,172
18117,JERRY," Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.",172
18118,KRAMER," No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.",172
18119,JERRY, Did he overdose?,172
18120,KRAMER," No, it's just too much.",172
18121,GEORGE," Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?",172
18122,GEORGE,  Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.,172
18123,KRAMER, Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?,172
18124,KRAMER," Okay, what do you got?",172
18125,KRAMER, Good luck with that.,172
18126,GEORGE, I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.,172
18127,JERRY, What did you do the rest of the day?,172
18128,GEORGE," I saw ""Titanic"". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?",172
18129,JERRY, And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.,172
18130,ELAINE, Hello boys.,172
18131,GEORGE," Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?",172
18132,ELAINE, I did.,172
18133,GEORGE, And the Christian rock?,172
18134,ELAINE," Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!",172
18135,GEORGE," Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?",172
18136,JERRY, No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?,172
18137,ELAINE," Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.",172
18138,GEORGE, I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.,172
18139,JERRY," I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the ""It's me"" on the phone today.",172
18140,ELAINE," ""It's me?"" Isn't it a little premature?",172
18141,JERRY, I thought so.,172
18142,ELAINE," Hah. She's not a ""me"". I'm a ""me"".",172
18143,GEORGE," I'm against all ""it's me""s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!",172
18144,KRAMER," Well, I got gonorrhea.",172
18145,ELAINE, That seems about right.,172
18146,KRAMER, That's what they gave me.,172
18147,GEORGE, They? The Government?,172
18148,JERRY," No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.",172
18149,KRAMER," And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.",172
18150,GEORGE," I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.",172
18151,GEORGE,  Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.,172
18152,ELAINE, What was that?,172
18153,JERRY," Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.",172
18154,KRAMER," See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.",172
18155,JERRY, Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.,172
18156,KRAMER," Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.",172
18157,KRAMER, Just a little burning during urination.,172
18158,KRAMER," The haunting memories of lost love. May I?  Lights?  Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.",172
18159,KRAMER, Gonorrhea!,172
18160,JERRY, One message. Hope it's not from you.,172
18161,JERRY, Sophie.,172
18162,GEORGE, She's still doing that?,172
18163,JERRY, Yep.,172
18164,GEORGE," Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the ""it's me"", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.",172
18165,JERRY," I think that's a ""what's good for the goose is good for the gander"".",172
18166,GEORGE," What the hell is a gander, anyway?",172
18167,JERRY,"  It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.",172
18168,JERRY,  She thinks it's someone named Raef.,172
18169,GEORGE," Good, let her think it.",172
18170,JERRY,"  So, what's going on?",172
18171,GEORGE," Ask about you, ask about you.",172
18172,JERRY," So, uh, how are things with Jerry?",172
18173,JERRY," Right, right, the tractor story.",172
18174,JERRY, I sound funny?,172
18175,GEORGE, Abort! Abort!,172
18176,JERRY," Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye.  That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?",172
18177,GEORGE, That was very real.,172
18178,JERRY, She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.,172
18179,GEORGE," Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?",172
18180,JERRY," Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?",172
18181,ELAINE, So where do you wanna eat?,172
18182,ELAINE, Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?,172
18183,ELAINE," Oh. So, you're pretty religious?",172
18184,ELAINE, So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?,172
18185,ELAINE, Why not?,172
18186,GEORGE, You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.,172
18187,JERRY," No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.",172
18188,GEORGE, Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?,172
18189,JERRY," No, she looks completely normal.",172
18190,GEORGE," Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.",172
18191,JERRY, You think she's got toes for thumbs?,172
18192,GEORGE," How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?",172
18193,JERRY, I don't know.,172
18194,GEORGE, Hands a little smelly?,172
18195,JERRY, Why do I seek your counsel?,172
18196,ELAINE, Well I'm going to hell.,172
18197,JERRY, That seems about right.,172
18198,ELAINE, According to Puddy.,172
18199,JERRY," Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--",172
18200,ELAINE, I'm not in the mood.,172
18201,GEORGE,  I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.,172
18202,JERRY, What do you care? You don't believe in hell.,172
18203,ELAINE," I know, but he does.",172
18204,JERRY, So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.,172
18205,ELAINE," Well, relationships are very important to me.",172
18206,JERRY, Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.,172
18207,GEORGE,  And a slice of devil's food cake.,172
18208,GEORGE, Hey. Where is everyone?,172
18209,GEORGE, I am?,172
18210,GEORGE, This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.,172
18211,GEORGE, Okay.,172
18212,GEORGE, And?,172
18213,KRAMER," Oh, thank you.",172
18214,KRAMER," Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.",172
18215,KRAMER," I don't believe this, I'm being typecast.",172
18216,JERRY," They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.",172
18217,JERRY," Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.",172
18218,JERRY, Tractor!,172
18219,JERRY," Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.",172
18220,GEORGE, A scar?,172
18221,JERRY, A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?,172
18222,GEORGE, A tractor.,172
18223,JERRY, I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.,172
18224,GEORGE, I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.,172
18225,JERRY, She doesn't have toe thumbs.,172
18226,GEORGE," Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--",172
18227,JERRY, Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?,172
18228,GEORGE," Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work.  Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry.  Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?",172
18229,GEORGE, Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?,172
18230,GEORGE,  Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?,172
18231,JERRY, Never.,172
18232,ELAINE," 'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.",172
18233,ELAINE," Well if you want it, you get it.",172
18234,ELAINE," Oh, but it's ok for me?",172
18235,ELAINE," Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.",172
18236,ELAINE, C'mon.,172
18237,ELAINE," David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?",172
18238,ELAINE," Uh, you should be trying to save me!",172
18239,ELAINE," I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.",172
18240,ELAINE," Yeah, that's right!",172
18241,KRAMER," Well, we'll see.",172
18242,KRAMER,"  Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.",172
18243,ELAINE," We're just, you know, having a good time.",172
18244,ELAINE," Well, thank you father.",172
18245,ELAINE," Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.",172
18246,JERRY," Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.",172
18247,JERRY,  Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.,172
18248,KRAMER," ...I didn't say that, no.",172
18249,KRAMER," Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.",172
18250,JERRY," Hey, hey! I'm with someone.",172
18251,KRAMER, Oh. Hello.,172
18252,KRAMER,  You know? She's right.,172
18253,JERRY, You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??,172
18254,KRAMER, You can't get it from that.,172
18255,JERRY,"  Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.",172
18256,GEORGE, Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?,172
18257,GEORGE," No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!",172
18258,GEORGE," Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!",172
18259,GEORGE," Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!",172
18260,GEORGE, No! No!,172
18261,GEORGE, I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.,173
18262,JERRY," First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.",173
18263,KRAMER," Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..",173
18264,JERRY,  You better hurry.,173
18265,GEORGE, I'm gonna hit the head.,173
18266,KRAMER," Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.",173
18267,JERRY,  Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.,173
18268,KRAMER," Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.",173
18269,JERRY, She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?,173
18270,KRAMER,"  No, that wasn't dancing.",173
18271,JERRY,"  Hey, there's Leo.",173
18272,KRAMER, Oh? Who's Leo?,173
18273,JERRY, Uncle Leo.,173
18274,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..",173
18275,JERRY, Did I just see that?!,173
18276,KRAMER,"  Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?",173
18277,ELAINE, Maybe.. All over your face!,173
18278,ELAINE," Hi, I'm miserable. ",173
18279,GEORGE,  I'm all set.,173
18280,GEORGE,  What do you want to hear?,173
18281,GEORGE," They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me.  How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.",173
18282,JERRY,  Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.,173
18283,GEORGE," They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!",173
18284,JERRY,  'French Impressionist Paintings'?,173
18285,GEORGE, I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-,173
18286,JERRY,  Thank you very much.,173
18287,GEORGE," Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?",173
18288,JERRY, I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.,173
18289,GEORGE,"  Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!",173
18290,JERRY, Sleeping in the caragain?,173
18291,ELAINE, Cocktail flu.,173
18292,JERRY,"  Oh, right. The big party..",173
18293,GEORGE," You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?",173
18294,ELAINE,"  No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..",173
18295,GEORGE, You went home with him?,173
18296,ELAINE, Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!,173
18297,JERRY,"  Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?",173
18298,ELAINE,  Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?,173
18299,JERRY,  What's your position?,173
18300,ELAINE, I am an associate.,173
18301,GEORGE," Hey, me too.",173
18302,ELAINE, Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.,173
18303,GEORGE," Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.",173
18304,ELAINE,"  Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.",173
18305,JERRY,  As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.,173
18306,ELAINE,"  Oh, bravo.",173
18307,JERRY,"  Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?",173
18308,KRAMER,"  No, we've already eaten.",173
18309,KRAMER," Jerry, check this out.  Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!",173
18310,JERRY,"  No, you're not.",173
18311,KRAMER," Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..",173
18312,JERRY,"  No, he doesn't.",173
18313,JERRY," Yes, it can.",173
18314,KRAMER," We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!",173
18315,JERRY," So, who's gonna pull this thing?",173
18316,KRAMER,"  Well, I just assumed you would.",173
18317,KRAMER,  Da-da-da-da no.,173
18318,JERRY,"  My, isn't this an awkward moment?",173
18319,KRAMER,  What about the homeless?,173
18320,KRAMER,  To pull the rickshaw.,173
18321,KRAMER, They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!,173
18322,JERRY,"  Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.",173
18323,JERRY," So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay?",173
18324,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?",173
18325,JERRY,"  Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.",173
18326,JERRY, Because you were too busy stealing a book.,173
18327,JERRY,"  Leo, I saw you steal.",173
18328,JERRY," Who, criminals?",173
18329,JERRY, You could get arrested.,173
18330,JERRY,  Leo..,173
18331,JERRY,  Thank you.,173
18332,ELAINE,"  Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?",173
18333,ELAINE," ""Well""? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.",173
18334,ELAINE,  Oh man. Ugh..,173
18335,ELAINE, Yeah.,173
18336,ELAINE,"  Yes. Oh, man! Oh!",173
18337,KRAMER," Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws.  Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.",173
18338,KRAMER,  Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.,173
18339,KRAMER, Hey.,173
18340,KRAMER,"  You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.",173
18341,KRAMER,  Giddy up! Good form.,173
18342,KRAMER," Hey, what's he doin'?",173
18343,KRAMER," Well, then, he's out!",173
18344,GEORGE," Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.",173
18345,GEORGE, Why not?,173
18346,GEORGE,  Flagged?,173
18347,GEORGE, It says that on the computer?,173
18348,GEORGE,"  Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!",173
18349,JERRY,"  I don't believe this!  Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..",173
18350,JERRY,"  He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..",173
18351,JERRY," '51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?",173
18352,JERRY,  I just wanted you to scare him.,173
18353,JERRY,  Hello?,173
18354,JERRY," Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.",173
18355,JERRY,  Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.,173
18356,JERRY,  Prior convictions? Leo?,173
18357,JERRY,  What does that mean?,173
18358,JERRY,  You're stealing too?!,173
18359,JERRY," Mom, you too?",173
18360,JERRY," Alright, I'll talk to you later.",173
18361,KRAMER,"  Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he , he bolted.",173
18362,JERRY,"  Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.",173
18363,KRAMER,"  See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.",173
18364,JERRY, To the Idiotmobile!,173
18365,JERRY," So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?",173
18366,ELAINE," That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-",173
18367,JERRY,  Tina Turner?,173
18368,ELAINE,  Alright.,173
18369,GEORGE," Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!",173
18370,JERRY, Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?,173
18371,GEORGE, I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.,173
18372,JERRY,  Not underpants.,173
18373,ELAINE," Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.",173
18374,JERRY,  Uncle Leo. Hello!,173

18376,JERRY,"  Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!",173
18377,ELAINE," French impressionism. Oh, I love this.  Now, what is the problem with this book?",173
18378,GEORGE, Nothing.,173
18379,ELAINE, How much do you want for it?,173
18380,GEORGE," You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.",173
18381,JERRY, Leo's furious.  What is that doing on the table?,173
18382,GEORGE,"  Jerry, simmer down.",173
18383,JERRY,  I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.,173
18384,ELAINE,  What is wrong with this book?,173
18385,GEORGE, Simmer!,173

18387,ELAINE,  Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! ,173
18388,GEORGE,"  May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?",173

18390,GEORGE," Well, aren't you something?",173
18391,ELAINE,  Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.,173

18393,ELAINE," An addict?  Well, it just keeps getting better!",173

18399,ELAINE,"  Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?",173
18400,JERRY, Nightmares. You?,173
18401,ELAINE, My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.,173
18402,ELAINE, Eat your soup!,173
18403,JERRY," You're not feeding him, are you?",173
18404,ELAINE," Why?  I told you, away from the curtains. Away.  Use your bucket.  There you go, that's it.  You know what? I gotta go.",173
18405,KRAMER," Hey, buddy.",173

18416,KRAMER, What?,173
18417,KRAMER," Yes, that's true.",173
18418,KRAMER," Well, there's only one way to settle this.  One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..",173
18419,KRAMER," Best two out of three?  One spot, two spot..",173
18420,GEORGE," Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.",173
18421,GEORGE," Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney.",173
18422,GEORGE, Oh.,173
18423,GEORGE,  Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.,173
18424,GEORGE,"  Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?",173
18425,GEORGE, I could take it in merchandise..,173
18426,ELAINE," So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?",173
18427,ELAINE, Great.,173
18428,JERRY,"  So, the worst is over?",173
18429,ELAINE," Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.",173
18430,JERRY, Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.,173
18431,ELAINE," Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.",173
18432,ELAINE,  See ya.,173
18433,JERRY,"  I'd like to speak with the manager, please.",173
18434,KRAMER,"  Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. ",173
18435,KRAMER,  Oh..,173
18436,KRAMER, Woah! Wait!,173
18437,JERRY, George? What are you doin' here?,173
18438,GEORGE, I can't sell the book. It's been marked.,173
18439,JERRY,  It certainly has.,173
18440,GEORGE," So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.",173
18441,JERRY,"  You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?",173
18442,GEORGE, I'm goin' in!,173
18443,JERRY, Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..,173
18444,JERRY,"  Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.",173
18445,JERRY, So it could be anyone?,173
18446,JERRY, That guy!  Swarm! Swarm!,173
18447,GEORGE, No! Jerry!,173
18448,ELAINE," Uh, no, thanks.",174
18449,ELAINE," You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.",174
18450,ELAINE, It's his birthday and it's his last day?,174
18451,ELAINE," All right, pile it on.",174
18452,JERRY, What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?,174
18453,ELAINE," It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?",174
18454,JERRY, Why aren't you there now?,174
18455,ELAINE," I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.",174
18456,JERRY," You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.",174
18457,ELAINE," Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..",174
18458,JERRY," Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?",174
18459,ELAINE, Your old high school hangout? Why?,174
18460,JERRY, They're closing. We're going for one last slice.,174
18461,KRAMER," Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.",174
18462,KRAMER," Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.",174
18463,JERRY, Where did you get this?,174
18464,KRAMER," Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.",174
18465,JERRY, You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?,174
18466,KRAMER, They want to know why they never see you.,174
18467,KRAMER, I'm gonna eat that later.,174
18468,JERRY, So they just gave you this?,174
18469,KRAMER," Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.",174
18470,ELAINE," Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?",174
18471,KRAMER," Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.",174
18472,JERRY, How come I haven't read about this?,174
18473,KRAMER," Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.",174
18474,ELAINE, Really? What're the other titles?,174
18475,KRAMER," Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad.",174
18476,JERRY, Son of dad?,174
18477,KRAMER, Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.,174
18478,GEORGE, Mario's Pizza.,174
18479,GEORGE," Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?",174
18480,JERRY, We used to come in every day.,174
18481,GEORGE, We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.,174
18482,JERRY," All right, make it the large sodas.",174
18483,GEORGE," Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.",174
18484,JERRY," Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.",174
18485,GEORGE, Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!,174
18486,GEORGE," Ah, beat it, punk.",174
18487,JERRY," Hey, look at the high score--""G.L.C."" George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?",174
18488,GEORGE," Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.",174
18489,JERRY, I remember that night.,174
18490,GEORGE, The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...,174
18491,JERRY, I think I remember why we stopped coming here.,174
18492,GEORGE, Yeah.,174
18493,ELAINE, What is this?,174
18494,ELAINE," Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?",174
18495,ELAINE," What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!",174
18496,JERRY," I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--",174
18497,JERRY," Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--",174
18498,JERRY, Not as long.,174
18499,JERRY, Get going.,174
18500,JERRY," Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--",174
18501,JERRY," Actually, that's--",174
18502,JERRY, Right.,174
18503,GEORGE," Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--",174
18504,JERRY, Sure.  How about this one?,174
18505,GEORGE," Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.",174
18506,JERRY," Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.",174
18507,GEORGE," So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?",174
18508,JERRY," Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?",174
18509,GEORGE, What?,174
18510,JERRY," Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.",174
18511,GEORGE, You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!,174
18512,KRAMER," Well, more bad news Jerry.",174
18513,KRAMER," You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.",174
18514,JERRY," Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.",174
18515,KRAMER, Not as many as there used to be.,174
18516,GEORGE," No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?",174
18517,KRAMER," You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.",174
18518,JERRY, Another friend?,174
18519,KRAMER," Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.",174
18520,GEORGE," Well, is he good, Kramer?",174
18521,KRAMER," Oh, he's the best...and the worst.",174
18522,GEORGE," Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.",174
18523,KRAMER," Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.",174
18524,GEORGE, Slippery Pete?,174
18525,KRAMER," Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.",174
18526,GEORGE," All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!",174
18527,JERRY, Come on.,174
18528,KRAMER, Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt.,174
18529,JERRY, Hello?,174
18530,ELAINE, So how's it going with my friend?,174
18531,JERRY, She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.,174
18532,JERRY, What is that?,174
18533,ELAINE," Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 4",174
18534,JERRY, So join in.,174
18535,ELAINE, I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.,174
18536,JERRY, All right.,174
18537,JERRY," Hey, wh-what--",174
18538,KRAMER, Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful.,174
18539,ELAINE, Anybody here? Peterboy?,174
18540,ELAINE," Ooh, it's a cake walk.",174
18541,ELAINE," Mr. Peterman, um--",174
18542,ELAINE," No, sir, I can't.",174
18543,JERRY," Well Lisi, that was another-",174
18544,JERRY, Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--,174
18545,JERRY, Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?,174
18546,JERRY, Riverside Park.,174
18547,JERRY, Back to my place. That's right.,174
18548,GEORGE, So you slept with her?,174
18549,JERRY," She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.",174
18550,GEORGE, And you automatically sleep with her?,174
18551,JERRY," Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--",174
18552,GEORGE, Finished your thought.,174
18553,ELAINE, Guess what I ate.,174
18554,GEORGE, An ostrich burger.,174
18555,ELAINE," No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.",174
18556,JERRY, How'd it taste?,174
18557,ELAINE, A little stale.,174
18558,JERRY, Yeah.,174
18559,GEORGE," You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.",174
18560,ELAINE," Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.",174
18561,JERRY," Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.",174
18562,ELAINE, What is going on with you two?,174
18563,JERRY," Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.",174
18564,GEORGE, What's that?,174
18565,ELAINE, 4,174
18566,JERRY," Well, I'm calling this off right now.",174
18567,ELAINE," No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.",174
18568,JERRY," Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.",174
18569,ELAINE, Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.,174
18570,ELAINE, Just a little off the side...,174
18571,ELAINE," Well, no point in wasting $1,200.",174
18572,GEORGE," Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.",174
18573,GEORGE," Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.",174
18574,GEORGE, Oh...you're very good.,174
18575,GEORGE," Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.",174
18576,KRAMER, Lock and load.,174
18577,KRAMER," All right, all right, come on, now.",174
18578,KRAMER," Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.",174
18579,KRAMER, You weren't even married yet.,174
18580,GEORGE," All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.",174
18581,GEORGE," Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.",174
18582,GEORGE, What do you mean?,174
18583,GEORGE, No. I--I paid for it.,174
18584,KRAMER, Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.,174
18585,GEORGE, We're not stealing it.,174
18586,GEORGE," All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?",174
18587,GEORGE," Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.",174
18588,GEORGE, The outlet?,174
18589,GEORGE, That's where the electricity comes out.,174
18590,GEORGE," Uh, here.",174
18591,GEORGE, The Frogger is here.,174
18592,KRAMER," George, I thought that was the door.",174
18593,GEORGE, All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.,174
18594,ELAINE, I need to replace an antique piece of cake.,174
18595,ELAINE," Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.",174
18596,KRAMER," Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?",174
18597,ELAINE," Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.",174
18598,KRAMER," Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. Yeah. They make good cake.",174
18599,ELAINE, Do any of these look close?,174
18600,KRAMER," No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah.",174
18601,ELAINE, Entenmann's? From the supermarket?,174
18602,KRAMER," Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle.",174
18603,JERRY," Hi, Lisi.",174
18604,JERRY," Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.",174
18605,JERRY," Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.",174
18606,JERRY," Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?",174
18607,JERRY, Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.,174
18608,JERRY, Have we even been in public?,174
18609,JERRY, You are not dumb. Don't say that..,174
18610,JERRY, These beans are pretty good.,174
18611,JERRY," Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!",174
18612,JERRY, Nice to meet ya!,174
18613,JERRY," Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?",174
18614,JERRY, We've been breaking up for 10 hours?,174
18615,JERRY," Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.",174
18616,JERRY, Lopper.,174
18617,JERRY," Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!",174
18618,GEORGE," Jerry, you came for the big moment.",174
18619,JERRY, No. I'm waiting for...,174
18620,GEORGE," Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone.",174
18621,JERRY, Oh. Sounds great.,174
18622,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.",174
18623,JERRY," Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.",174
18624,GEORGE, Where?,174
18625,JERRY," Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?",174
18626,JERRY," A long, long weekend.",174
18627,GEORGE, I hear thee.,174
18628,ELAINE," Oh, hello.",174
18629,ELAINE, I guess I'll just--,174
18630,GEORGE, What are you guys doing?,174
18631,GEORGE, You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.,174
18632,GEORGE, Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria,174
18633,KRAMER," George, they closed up.",174
18634,GEORGE, I need an outlet!,174
18635,GEORGE, Holes! I need holes!,174
18636,KRAMER, The pharmacy's still open.,174
18637,GEORGE," All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist.",174
18638,KRAMER, Ahh! I'm out! No tape left!,174
18639,JERRY," Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.",174
18640,GEORGE, Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.,174
18641,JERRY, By yourself?,174
18642,GEORGE," Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.",174
18643,JERRY, Game over.,174
18644,ELAINE," Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?",174
18645,ELAINE, Ohh...,174
18646,ELAINE," Mr. Peterman, I, uh...",174
18647,ELAINE, Um...as far as I know.,174
18648,ELAINE," Uh, I guess I hadn't--",174
18649,GEORGE, What happened to your voice?,175
18650,JERRY, I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.,175
18651,GEORGE," Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.",175
18652,JERRY, Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?,175
18653,GEORGE," The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.",175
18654,JERRY, You mean like...Liza!,175
18655,GEORGE, But I was thinking...T-bone.,175
18656,JERRY," But there's no ""t"" in your name. What about G-bone?",175
18657,GEORGE, There's no G-bone.,175
18658,JERRY, There's a g-spot.,175
18659,GEORGE, That's a myth.,175
18660,JERRY," T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya.",175
18661,ELAINE, Why did they hire you for a rodeo?,175
18662,JERRY, They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.,175
18663,ELAINE, Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--,175
18664,JERRY," Oh, I had that comin' to me.",175
18665,ELAINE," You know, Kenny Rogers has a-",175
18666,JERRY, You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.,175
18667,ELAINE, Where did you get her?,175
18668,JERRY, I hired her from a service!,175
18669,JERRY, Thank you. Nice job.,175
18670,JERRY, Yeah.,175
18671,JERRY, What?,175
18672,ELAINE," Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?",175
18673,JERRY, Notice what? She's not really even a maid.,175
18674,ELAINE, Oh.,175
18675,JERRY," She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.",175
18676,ELAINE, Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.,175
18677,KRAMER," Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.",175
18678,JERRY, You have a girlfriend?,175
18679,KRAMER," Jerry, where have you been?",175
18680,JERRY, At a rodeo. Where's she moving?,175
18681,KRAMER, Downtown.,175
18682,ELAINE, Downtown New York?,175
18683,KRAMER, Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.,175
18684,JERRY, It's like 10 minutes by subway.,175
18685,KRAMER, I don't know.,175
18686,KRAMER," Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.",175
18687,ELAINE, What? What is that?,175
18688,JERRY," That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.",175
18689,ELAINE, I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.,175
18690,KRAMER," Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.",175
18691,ELAINE, At work?,175
18692,KRAMER, No. At your apartment.,175
18693,ELAINE, I don't have a fax machine.,175
18694,JERRY, Here we go.,175
18695,KRAMER," Well, now what are we gonna do?  See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.",175
18696,JERRY, And a dead bolt.,175
18697,ELAINE, Then maybe you have a fax machine.,175
18698,KRAMER, You just blew my mind.,175
18699,GEORGE, T-bone steak.,175
18700,GEORGE," Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--",175
18701,GEORGE," Uh, no. No, we shouldn't.",175
18702,ELAINE, Hello?,175
18703,ELAINE, What?,175
18704,GEORGE," Hey, it's George. Listen, I-",175
18705,ELAINE, Hello?,175
18706,ELAINE, Aah!,175
18707,JERRY," Well Cindy, the place looks great.",175
18708,JERRY," Ok, I'll see ya.",175
18709,ELAINE, All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.,175
18710,JERRY," Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?",175
18711,ELAINE, You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.,175
18712,JERRY, No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--,175
18713,ELAINE, What? A health plan?,175
18714,JERRY," I was going to say, ""Being a good host.""",175
18715,ELAINE, Oh-ho-ho. Oh.,175
18716,JERRY," But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.",175
18717,ELAINE, So you consider this a relationship?,175
18718,JERRY," Yes, I do.",175
18719,ELAINE, Oh. Have you been out?,175
18720,JERRY," Yes, we have.",175
18721,ELAINE, Where did you go?,175
18722,JERRY, The store.,175
18723,ELAINE, Mm! To get what?,175
18724,JERRY, Stuff.,175
18725,ELAINE, Cleaning supplies?,175
18726,JERRY, And gum.,175
18727,ELAINE," Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.",175
18728,JERRY, She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!,175
18729,KRAMER," Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.",175
18730,ELAINE," Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?",175
18731,KRAMER," Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.",175
18732,ELAINE, Which ones?,175
18733,KRAMER," Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.",175
18734,ELAINE, So this is never gonna stop?,175
18735,KRAMER," Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?",175
18736,ELAINE, You can pick 'em up right now.,175
18737,KRAMER, Ah!,175
18738,ELAINE, Ahem. 646? What is this?,175
18739,ELAINE, I thought 646 was just for new numbers.,175
18740,ELAINE," No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.",175
18741,ELAINE," You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.",175
18742,JERRY," Kramer, you're still on the phone?",175
18743,KRAMER," Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?",175
18744,JERRY, Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?,175
18745,JERRY, Madeline stays here.,175
18746,JERRY," Hey, T-bone!",175
18747,GEORGE, No. No T-bone.,175
18748,JERRY, No T-bone?,175
18749,JERRY, No! There's no T-bone!,175
18750,KRAMER," Well, why no T-bone?!",175
18751,JERRY, Why no T-bone?,175
18752,GEORGE, 'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone!,175
18753,KRAMER," Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?",175
18754,KRAMER," Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah.",175
18755,GEORGE, Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?,175
18756,GEORGE, You're sleepin' with the maid?,175
18757,JERRY, Yes.,175
18758,GEORGE, I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?,175
18759,JERRY, No.,175
18760,ELAINE," No, I'm not. Here you go.",175
18761,ELAINE, It's a new area code.,175
18762,ELAINE," No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.",175
18763,ELAINE," Yeah? Well, so am I!",175
18764,GEORGE," Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?",175
18765,GEORGE, The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone.,175
18766,GEORGE," What? Now, you listen to me!",175
18767,GEORGE," Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-",175
18768,GEORGE, What?,175
18769,ELAINE," Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?",175
18770,ELAINE," Oh, I'm so sorry.",175
18771,ELAINE, A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?,175
18772,KRAMER," Hey, listen, can I borrow your suitcases?",175
18773,JERRY, Yeah. It's in your closet.,175
18774,KRAMER," No, no, no. I looked.",175
18775,JERRY, They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.,175
18776,KRAMER," Thanks, buddy.",175
18777,JERRY, Where you goin'?,175
18778,KRAMER," Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?",175
18779,JERRY," Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.",175
18780,KRAMER, Oh.,175
18781,KRAMER," Well, what's the matter?",175
18782,JERRY, What did I just pay for?,175
18783,KRAMER, Uh-oh. You're a john.,175
18784,JERRY, Koko?,175
18785,GEORGE, Koko.,175
18786,JERRY," Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.",175
18787,GEORGE," Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?",175
18788,JERRY," Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.",175
18789,GEORGE," Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--",175
18790,JERRY," No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.",175
18791,GEORGE, How much you pay this maid?,175
18792,JERRY, 40.,175
18793,GEORGE," 40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.",175
18794,JERRY, I don't know what this is.,175
18795,KRAMER," Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.",175
18796,JERRY, Ooh.,175
18797,KRAMER," Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.",175
18798,GEORGE, I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.,175
18799,KRAMER," Well, now I can't see Jerry.",175
18800,JERRY, I look about the same.,175
18801,GEORGE, What?,175
18802,JERRY, I was talking to him.,175
18803,KRAMER, What?,175
18804,JERRY, Never mind.,175
18805,KRAMER, Come on. What'd he say?,175
18806,GEORGE, Never mind.,175
18807,KRAMER," Jerry, come on. What'd you say?",175
18808,JERRY, What?,175
18809,KRAMER, Come on. Where'd you go?,175
18810,JERRY, Go back.,175
18811,KRAMER, Eh! Come on. What did you say?,175
18812,JERRY," I said, never mind.",175
18813,KRAMER," Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh.",175
18814,JERRY, I hate the counter.,175
18815,ELAINE, Hey.,175
18816,JERRY, Hey.,175
18817,ELAINE, I hate the counter.,175
18818,KRAMER, Who's that?,175
18819,JERRY," Oh, she didn't mind?",175
18820,ELAINE, No. She died.,175
18821,JERRY," Hey, that's great.",175
18822,GEORGE, What happened to Mrs. Krantz?,175
18823,JERRY, Elaine got a new number because she died.,175
18824,KRAMER, Newman died?,175
18825,ELAINE, What did he say?,175
18826,JERRY, Some new kind of pie.,175
18827,GEORGE, I'll try a piece.,175
18828,KRAMER," All right, who's down there?",175
18829,JERRY," Hey, there's a booth.",175
18830,KRAMER," Hey, Elaine.",175
18831,ELAINE," Oh, hi.",175
18832,KRAMER, Did you hear about Newman?,175
18833,ELAINE, What?,175
18834,GEORGE, Hey.,175
18835,JERRY, So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?,175
18836,GEORGE," Oh, yeah.",175
18837,JERRY, Double zero?,175
18838,GEORGE," It's ""ooh"" As in ""ooh ooh ah ah.""",175
18839,GEORGE, Really? Coco?,175
18840,GEORGE," You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.",175
18841,JERRY, Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.,175
18842,GEORGE, Say good-bye to Koko.,175
18843,JERRY," Good-bye, Koko.",175
18844,KRAMER," Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.",175
18845,JERRY," Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.",175
18846,KRAMER," Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!",175
18847,JERRY, I didn't hear anything.,175
18848,JERRY," Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.",175
18849,JERRY, For what?,175
18850,JERRY, But you didn't really do any work.,175
18851,JERRY, But you took a nap in it.,175
18852,JERRY, I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.,175
18853,JERRY," Well, who took the nap?",175
18854,JERRY, $40 seems kind of steep for a nap.,175
18855,JERRY," Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.",175
18856,JERRY, So is this a breakup/quitting?,175
18857,JERRY," Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!",175
18858,ELAINE, Yes! 212.,175
18859,ELAINE," Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?",175
18860,ELAINE, All right! I am back in the game.,175
18861,ELAINE, Hello?,175
18862,ELAINE," No. You got the wrong number, kid.",175
18863,ELAINE, Oh...nuts.,175
18864,ELAINE, No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.,175
18865,JERRY, So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?,175
18866,ELAINE, Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?,175
18867,JERRY, Miss.,175
18868,ELAINE, He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.,175
18869,JERRY, I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?,175
18870,ELAINE, Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine.,175
18871,JERRY, Elaine...,175
18872,JERRY, Hello?,175
18873,KRAMER," Hey, buddy, don't say no!",175
18874,JERRY, I accept.,175
18875,KRAMER," I went down to Madeline's. I told her, ""You gotta move, or it's over.""",175
18876,JERRY," Well, what happened?",175
18877,KRAMER," I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.",175
18878,JERRY, What's around you?,175
18879,KRAMER, I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?,175
18880,JERRY, Is it Famous Ray's?,175
18881,KRAMER, No. It's Original Ray's.,175
18882,JERRY, Famous Original Ray's?,175
18883,KRAMER," It's just Original, Jerry!",175
18884,JERRY," Well, what street are you on?",175
18885,KRAMER," Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.",175
18886,JERRY," Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!",175
18887,KRAMER, Aah!,175
18888,JERRY, Yeah.,175
18889,JERRY, Cindy.,175
18890,JERRY," You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.",175
18891,JERRY," Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.",175
18892,JERRY, What?,175
18893,JERRY, I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.,175
18894,ELAINE," Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy?  All right, here we go.  Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.",175
18895,JERRY," Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy.",175
18896,JERRY, Here. I got your money.,175
18897,JERRY, Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.,175
18898,JERRY," Well, this is all very sophisticated.",175
18899,ELAINE, Aah!,175
18900,KRAMER," Uh, no.",175
18901,KRAMER," Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is.",175
18902,KRAMER," Uh, no.",175
18903,KRAMER, Ok.,175
18904,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah.",175
18905,KRAMER, Hi. Ahh...these are soft seats.,175
18906,GEORGE," This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.",175
18907,GEORGE, Yes?,175
18908,GEORGE, Coco?,175
18909,GEORGE," Well, it was a hell of a ride.",175
18910,GEORGE," Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.",175
18911,GEORGE, Forget Gammy.,175
18912,GEORGE, There's no Gammy.,175
18913,GEORGE," Oh, no.",175
18914,GEORGE, Gammy's gettin' upset!,175
18915,GEORGE," Man, I'm starving.",176
18916,ELAINE, How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?,176
18917,GEORGE, Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.,176
18918,JERRY, Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.,176
18919,KRAMER," You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.",176
18920,JERRY, I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.,176
18921,ELAINE," Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.",176
18922,GEORGE, Those nachos are killing me.,176
18923,ELAINE, I thought you were hungry.,176
18924,GEORGE, It's complicated.,176
18925,KRAMER," Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.",176
18926,JERRY, Keep your shirt on. I got it.,176
18927,ELAINE, Watch out for that maroon Golf.,176
18928,KRAMER," Oh, boy.",176
18929,JERRY, Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.,176
18930,KRAMER," I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...",176
18931,JERRY," Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.",176
18932,KRAMER," You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.",176
18933,ELAINE," Oh, no, I couldn't do that.",176
18934,KRAMER," Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.",176
18935,ELAINE," Oh, all right.",176
18936,KRAMER, Yeah.,176
18937,GEORGE, So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.,176
18938,ELAINE," Oh, yeah. What's that called?",176
18939,GEORGE, Blimp,176
18940,JERRY, How was it?,176
18941,GEORGE, I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?,176
18942,JERRY, Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.,176
18943,GEORGE," Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, ""That's gotta hurt!""",176
18944,JERRY, Heh.,176
18945,GEORGE, The place went nuts.,176
18946,JERRY, Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.,176
18947,GEORGE, Yeah.,176
18948,KRAMER, Why are we slowing down?,176
18949,JERRY, What is that music?,176
18950,GEORGE, What's with all these flags?,176
18951,JERRY," Oh, no.",176
18952,ELAINE, It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!,176
18953,JERRY, It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!,176
18954,ELAINE," Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.",176
18955,KRAMER, All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.,176
18956,KRAMER," Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.",176
18957,KRAMER, Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.,176
18958,JERRY," See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.",176
18959,GEORGE, I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.,176
18960,ELAINE," I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.",176
18961,JERRY, I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.,176
18962,KRAMER," All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.",176
18963,JERRY," But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?",176
18964,GEORGE, Just inch over. You worm your way.,176
18965,ELAINE," Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.",176
18966,KRAMER," You know, you should make yourself throw up.",176
18967,ELAINE, Huh?,176
18968,KRAMER, You know you're going to.,176
18969,JERRY," All right, I'm worming.",176
18970,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.",176
18971,JERRY, They're not letting me in.,176
18972,GEORGE, My hand is out.,176
18973,JERRY," Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.",176
18974,ELAINE, You sure you want his face?,176
18975,KRAMER," No, no, no. It was María Conchita Alonso.",176
18976,GEORGE, This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.,176
18977,JERRY, The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.,176
18978,GEORGE, Look at me! I am man! I am you!,176
18979,GEORGE," All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.",176
18980,KRAMER, Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.,176
18981,JERRY, One more lane to go.,176
18982,GEORGE, All right! We're here!,176
18983,JERRY, Maroon Golf.,176
18984,JERRY, Could you move your car back a little?,176
18985,ELAINE," All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.",176
18986,JERRY, You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.,176
18987,ELAINE, I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.,176
18988,KRAMER," Con dios? Well, that's rude.",176
18989,JERRY, Can you believe her?,176
18990,GEORGE, Yeah. I'll see you later.,176
18991,JERRY, Where are you going?,176
18992,GEORGE, The movies. Blimp is playing right there.,176
18993,JERRY, You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?,176
18994,GEORGE," It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.",176
18995,JERRY, That's not what I do.,176
18996,GEORGE, Isn't it?,176
18997,JERRY," Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.",176
18998,KRAMER," You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.",176
18999,ELAINE, Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?,176
19000,ELAINE, Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.,176
19001,ELAINE," Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here.",176
19002,ELAINE," Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!",176
19003,ELAINE, That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.,176
19004,ELAINE, Hey. Taxi! Taxi!,176
19005,GEORGE," Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.",176
19006,GEORGE," Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?",176
19007,GEORGE," Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.",176
19008,GEORGE," It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...",176
19009,JERRY," I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.",176
19010,KRAMER," You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.",176
19011,JERRY, Walk away?,176
19012,KRAMER," You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.",176
19013,JERRY, Isn't there a deductible?,176
19014,KRAMER," All right, what is your deductible?",176
19015,JERRY, I don't know.,176
19016,KRAMER," Yes, because they've already deducted it.",176
19017,JERRY, From what?,176
19018,KRAMER," The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.",176
19019,JERRY, We're not leaving the car!,176
19020,KRAMER," All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.",176
19021,JERRY, Absolutely not. He sped up.,176
19022,JERRY, I'm ready to talk.,176
19023,GEORGE, That's gotta hurt!,176
19024,GEORGE, It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!,176
19025,GEORGE," Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!",176
19026,KRAMER," Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an ""I am sorry"" wave.",176
19027,JERRY, What's that?,176
19028,KRAMER," You raise the hand, lower the head-- ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!"" You get my drift.",176
19029,JERRY, Ok!,176
19030,KRAMER," Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.",176
19031,GEORGE," All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.",176
19032,JERRY, What's that on your forehead?,176
19033,GEORGE, It's probably chocolate.,176
19034,JERRY," Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?",176
19035,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!",176
19036,GEORGE," All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!",176
19037,JERRY," See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an ""I'm not sorry"" wave.",176
19038,JERRY," I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!",176
19039,JERRY, Elaine?!,176
19040,ELAINE, Jerry?!,176
19041,JERRY," So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?",176
19042,JERRY, Not you! The guy in the Amigo.,176
19043,ELAINE," Uh, well, uh, here--here is good.",176
19044,ELAINE," Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.",176
19045,ELAINE," Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?",176
19046,JERRY," Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!",176
19047,ELAINE," I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.",176
19048,JERRY," Elaine, he doesn't need-",176
19049,JERRY, 'Cause that's what's gonna happen.,176
19050,KRAMER, Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?,176
19051,GEORGE, Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.,176
19052,ELAINE," All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.",176
19053,GEORGE," This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?",176
19054,JERRY, I don't know.,176
19055,GEORGE," I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.",176
19056,KRAMER," You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.",176
19057,JERRY," Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.",176
19058,GEORGE," Oh, my god.",176
19059,JERRY," Hey, there's the soda guy.",176
19060,ELAINE," Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!",176
19061,ELAINE," Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.",176
19062,ELAINE," Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!",176
19063,ELAINE, All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.,176
19064,ELAINE, Get in there!,176
19065,KRAMER," Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment.",176
19066,KRAMER, Ok.,176
19067,KRAMER, Oh. Delicious to meet you.,176
19068,KRAMER," Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with.  Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?",176
19069,KRAMER," Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?",176
19070,KRAMER, How about a bathroom?,176
19071,KRAMER," Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?",176
19072,KRAMER," Oh, thank you.",176
19073,ELAINE," Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon.",176
19074,ELAINE," Well, I, for one, really respect that.",176
19075,ELAINE," Come on, father, you can make it.",176
19076,ELAINE, No! I won't!,176
19077,ELAINE, All right. Take it easy.,176
19078,ELAINE," All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy.",176
19079,JERRY," What seems to be the problem, officer?",176
19080,GEORGE," They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?",176
19081,JERRY, At me?,176
19082,GEORGE, No.,176
19083,JERRY, Oh. It's back.,176
19084,GEORGE," Bring it on, baby",176
19085,JERRY, What if it gets in the side?,176
19086,GEORGE, The side?,176
19087,JERRY," Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-",176
19088,GEORGE, All right!,176
19089,JERRY, Oh. It's in your eye now.,176
19090,KRAMER," Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!",176
19091,JERRY," Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!",176
19092,KRAMER," Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game.",176
19093,JERRY, You were watchin'? Where?,176
19094,JERRY," Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!",176
19095,JERRY," Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?",176
19096,JERRY, Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?,176
19097,JERRY, Not Pennypacker!,176
19098,JERRY," I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!",176
19099,GEORGE," Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.",176
19100,ELAINE, We should be able to get across right through here!,176
19101,ELAINE," Oh, no! I thought--",176
19102,ELAINE, Get a hold of yourself!,176
19103,ELAINE, Sorry. Somebody...help us!,176
19104,ELAINE, We're down here! Help!,176
19105,ELAINE, Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.,176
19106,ELAINE, Help us up so we can cross the street?,176
19107,ELAINE, But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.,176
19108,ELAINE," Oh, god! Let us out!",176
19109,GEORGE, That wasn't a laser pen.,176
19110,GEORGE," Oh, that's funny",176
19111,KRAMER," Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.",176
19112,KRAMER," Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.",176
19113,KRAMER," See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?",176
19114,KRAMER, Ooh! !Dios mio!,176
19115,KRAMER," Oh, no.",176
19116,KRAMER, It was an accident.,176
19117,KRAMER," Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!",176
19118,GEORGE," Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?",176
19119,JERRY," Oh, hello...",176
19120,GEORGE, Art.,176
19121,JERRY," Mr. Vandelay, of course.",176
19122,KRAMER," Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.",176
19123,KRAMER," Uh, Varnsen.",176

19126,GEORGE, Pennypacker. Varnsen.,176
19127,JERRY," Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?",176
19128,KRAMER, The factory?,176
19129,JERRY, The Saab factory?,176
19130,KRAMER," Jerry, that's in Sweden.",176
19131,JERRY, My car!,176
19132,KRAMER," Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.",176
19133,GEORGE," Jerry, the Mets lost.",176
19134,JERRY, I love a parade!,176
19135,GEORGE, How do you suppose they did that?,176
19136,KRAMER," Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?",176
19137,JERRY," Well, what about my car?",176
19138,KRAMER," Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.",176
19139,JERRY," Hey, there's Elaine.",176
19140,ELAINE, Hey.,176
19141,JERRY," Well, you look, uh...relaxed.",176
19142,ELAINE," Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.",176
19143,JERRY," Well, at least he didn't-",176
19144,JERRY, Somebody remember where we parked.,176
19145,KRAMER, This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.,176
19146,GEORGE,  You know if we are gonna see this movie we gotta get moving.,177
19147,ELAINE, Let's Roll ,177
19148,KRAMER," Come on people, previews, Shnell! Shnell!",177
19149,JERRY," Oh, Hello. Nine years, seems like a long time doesn't it? It is, and we've packed a lot in the four of us, it seems like every week a whole new set of problems would just crop up outta nowhere...except for summer where nothing seemed to happen for months at a time. Anyway the point is over the last nine years...",177
19150,GEORGE,  Jerry were gonna miss the movie.,177
19151,JERRY,  I'm comin'!,177
19152,JERRY,"  Just go already!  Over the last nine years we've had a lot experiences. And I'll tell ya, when you stop and add em all up. That's what you realize. Watch this.",177
19153,ELAINE,  Jerry?!,177
19154,JERRY,  SHUTUP!! ,177
19155,JERRY," Wow Nine years, A hundred and eighty shows  same twelve boxes of cereal, and millions and millions of dollars.",177
19156,KRAMER, Jerry you in there?,177
19157,JERRY,"  Busy  We've made a lot of friends, shared a lot of laughs, often at the expense of others, and slept with.. well who's counting?",177
19158,KRAMER,  Ah man why's the door locked.,177
19159,JERRY, I'm coming. Anyway watch this.,177
19160,KRAMER,"  Jeez,  who you talking to?",177
19161,JERRY,  No one.,177
19162,KRAMER,"  Oh, Hello.",177
19163,JERRY,  KRAMER!,177
19164,JERRY,"JERRY: Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. ""Oh, is he good?"" ""Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best."" They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, ""You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher."" And then there's always that, ""Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me."" Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, ""Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs.""",18
19165,JERRY, What do you think the worst part of being blind is?,18
19166,JERRY," You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?",18
19167,JERRY, I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.,18
19168,JERRY, You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?,18
19169,JERRY," He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.",18
19170,JERRY," Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that.  And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.",18
19171,JERRY, Who takes care of your boy during the day?,18
19172,JERRY, No no. I'm just saying.,18
19173,JERRY," Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.",18
19174,JERRY, You know I think this is really helping.,18
19175,JERRY, So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.,18
19176,ELAINE, I don't like to talk during a massage.,18
19177,JERRY," Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.",18
19178,GEORGE," Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.",18
19179,ELAINE, Oh! I forgot to tell you--,18
19180,JERRY, I'm in the middle of a story.,18
19181,ELAINE," Oh, okay, go ahead.",18
19182,GEORGE, Why don't you ever go shopping?,18
19183,JERRY, Well it’s not like it's a really funny story or anything.,18
19184,ELAINE, What happened?,18
19185,JERRY," Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.",18
19186,ELAINE," Oh, wasn't that terrible?",18
19187,JERRY," Yes, it was.",18
19188,GEORGE, Not even an apple.,18
19189,ELAINE," She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.",18
19190,JERRY, I know it was stupid.,18
19191,ELAINE, Really stupid. ,18
19192,JERRY," Hey, I just said it was stupid.",18
19193,GEORGE, What about this leftover Chinese food?,18
19194,JERRY, Take it.,18
19195,ELAINE, I can't believe you said that.,18
19196,JERRY," Hey, would you stop it already?",18
19197,ELAINE," So, what’d she say?",18
19198,JERRY," I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.",18
19199,GEORGE,"  This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. ",18
19200,ELAINE, I have a good masseuse you could go to.,18
19201,JERRY," Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.",18
19202,GEORGE, Physical therapy is covered by insurance?,18
19203,JERRY, Yeah.,18

19205,JERRY, Not if you have a doctor's note.,18
19206,ELAINE, So where do you get this note?,18
19207,JERRY," Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.",18
19208,GEORGE," Right, your friend Roy.",18
19209,ELAINE, What's the name of this physical therapist?,18
19210,JERRY," I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.",18
19211,GEORGE, And you don't have to pay.,18
19212,GEORGE," We have a, three-o'clock appointments.",18
19213,ELAINE, Right.,18
19214,ELAINE,  Ok.,18
19215,GEORGE," Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?",18
19216,GEORGE," But, uh, Raymond is a man.",18
19217,GEORGE, I can't get a massage from a man.,18
19218,ELAINE, Why not?,18
19219,GEORGE," What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.",18
19220,ELAINE," No, I don't want the man either.",18
19221,GEORGE," What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.",18
19222,ELAINE, He'd just be touching your back.,18
19223,GEORGE, He'd just be touching your back too.,18
19224,ELAINE," No, it could get sexual.",18
19225,GEORGE," I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.",18
19226,ELAINE, I wouldn't be comfortable.,18
19227,GEORGE, I would? What if something happens?,18
19228,ELAINE, What could happen?,18
19229,GEORGE, What if it felt good?,18
19230,ELAINE, It's supposed to feel good.,18
19231,GEORGE, I don't want it to feel good.,18

19253,JERRY," No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.",18
19254,JERRY, What's with you?,18

19264,JERRY, That's a massage.,18
19265,GEORGE, And then I took my pants off.,18
19266,JERRY, You took your pants off?,18
19267,GEORGE, For my hamstring.,18
19268,JERRY, Oh.,18
19269,GEORGE," He got about uh, two inches from... there.",18
19270,JERRY, Really?,18
19271,GEORGE, I think it moved.,18
19272,JERRY, Moved?,18
19273,GEORGE," It may have moved, I don't know.",18
19274,JERRY, I'm sure it didn't move.,18
19275,GEORGE, It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.,18
19276,JERRY," Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.",18
19277,GEORGE," No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.",18
19278,JERRY," Okay, so what if it moved?",18
19279,GEORGE, That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.,18
19280,JERRY," That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.",18
19281,GEORGE, You think it's contact? It has to be touched?,18
19282,JERRY, That's what a gym teacher once told me.,18
19283,KRAMER, Hey.,18
19284,JERRY, Hey.,18
19285,KRAMER," I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.",18

19287,KRAMER, Yeah. Joe DiMaggio.,18
19288,JERRY," No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.",18
19289,KRAMER, Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.,18
19290,GEORGE, I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.,18
19291,JERRY, I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.,18
19292,KRAMER, Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?,18
19293,JERRY," He can have a donut,",18
19294,KRAMER, Yeah.,18
19295,JERRY, …but not at Dinky.,18
19296,GEORGE," I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.",18
19297,KRAMER," Look I'm tellin--  I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.",18
19298,GEORGE," The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.",18
19299,JERRY, I never said I'd do that.,18
19300,GEORGE," What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.",18
19301,JERRY, I don't know how I feel about it.,18
19302,GEORGE," Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?",18
19303,JERRY," Alright, alright.",18
19304,KRAMER," A stall man, huh? ",18
19305,GEORGE, All right -- ,18
19306,KRAMER, Wha-ha-a-at? ,18
19307,JERRY," ...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.",18
19308,GEORGE, He didn't say he can't.,18
19309,JERRY," I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.",18
19310,GEORGE, He doesn't feel funny.,18
19311,JERRY, If he does.,18
19312,GEORGE, Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.,18
19313,JERRY, He feels funny. You don't have to do this.,18
19314,GEORGE, He knows that!,18
19315,JERRY," Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?",18
19316,GEORGE," Oh, can you be any more dramatic?",18
19317,GEORGE, How would I know?,18
19318,GEORGE," What do you mean, like him?",18
19319,GEORGE, I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.,18
19320,GEORGE, Why should I?,18
19321,JERRY, What is the matter with you?,18
19322,GEORGE," Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?",18
19323,JERRY," You don't have to, really.",18
19324,JERRY," We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George?  George?",18
19325,JERRY, Well what about the week after?,18
19326,JERRY, No appointments at all? ,18
19327,ELAINE, What? ,18
19328,JERRY," Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it.  I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane.  What's with you?",18
19329,ELAINE, What?,18
19330,JERRY," Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.",18
19331,ELAINE," Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.",18
19332,KRAMER," Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.",18
19333,JERRY, Uh huh.,18
19334,KRAMER, Yeah.,18
19335,ELAINE, Joe DiMaggio?,18
19336,KRAMER," Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.",18
19337,ELAINE, Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?!,18
19338,KRAMER, That's right.,18
19339,JERRY," See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.",18
19340,KRAMER," Oh, he's a dunker.",18
19341,ELAINE, Why couldn't he be a dunker?,18
19342,KRAMER," And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that he’ll look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang*  You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip*  *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.",18
19343,ELAINE, So then what?,18
19344,KRAMER," Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.",18
19345,ELAINE, Why didn't you just call out his name?,18
19346,JERRY, What happened to you?,18
19347,GEORGE, These kids called me a Mary.,18
19348,ELAINE, A what?,18
19349,GEORGE," I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this.  And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.",18
19350,KRAMER," Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.",18
19351,ELAINE," Hey, George? What is this?  What is that? No really, what is that?",18
19352,JERRY," Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye.  That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.",18

19355,JERRY, I told you we shouldn't do it.,18
19356,GEORGE, He didn't say anything.,18
19357,JERRY," He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.",18

19431,JERRY," What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, ""Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'""",18

19513,JERRY, I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?,19
19514,GEORGE, It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.,19
19515,JERRY, Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them.,19
19516,GEORGE," Oh, no. We left on good terms.",19
19517,JERRY, How is that possible?,19
19518,GEORGE," Because I uh, I told her the truth.",19
19519,JERRY," Oh, my God.",19
19520,GEORGE, It's OK.,19
19521,JERRY, It's unheard of ...,19

19524,GEORGE, I told her that she was pretentious.,19
19525,JERRY, Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want,19
19526,ELAINE, How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?,19
19527,GEORGE, Like what? What could they say?,19
19528,ELAINE, There are plenty of things to say.,19
19529,GEORGE," Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?",19
19530,ELAINE," George, please.",19

19553,JERRY, Not good.,19

19555,JERRY, Not good,19
19556,KRAMER," Yeah, it's a windshield.",19

19558,KRAMER, I found it on the road.,19
19559,JERRY, Yeah ,19
19560,ELAINE,  I just finished working out are you busy?,19
19561,JERRY, Come on up.,19
19562,KRAMER, Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.,19
19563,JERRY," wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?",19
19564,KRAMER, wow,19

19569,JERRY, Tell me what?,19
19570,ELAINE," Huh, go ahead, tell him.",19
19571,KRAMER," I, I saw her naked.",19
19572,ELAINE," He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.",19
19573,KRAMER," Well, you know, ... it was an accident.",19
19574,ELAINE, Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!,19
19575,KRAMER, I thought it was a closet.,19
19576,JERRY, Completely naked?,19
19577,KRAMER, Completely naked.,19
19578,ELAINE," Jerrryyy, How can I go on?",19
19579,KRAMER, All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.,19

19581,KRAMER," No, I want you to see me naked.",19
19582,ELAINE," No, no no.",19
19583,KRAMER," No, I want to show you.",19
19584,ELAINE, No! Jerry! Jerry!,19
19585,JERRY," OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.",19
19586,ELAINE, What is this?,19
19587,KRAMER," Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.",19
19588,ELAINE," Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.",19
19589,JERRY, You'll sense it.,19
19590,JERRY," Well, what happened? Was she there?",19
19591,GEORGE," No, no she wasn't.",19
19592,JERRY, You didn't get my papers?,19
19593,GEORGE," No, I didn't.",19
19594,JERRY," Well, where is she?",19
19595,GEORGE, A mental institution.,19
19596,JERRY," Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good  feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it.  There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know,  I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this  I think that would really help a lot.",19
19597,JERRY, A mental institution?,19
19598,KRAMER, You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.,19
19599,GEORGE," It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.",19
19600,ELAINE, Who told you this,19
19601,GEORGE, Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.,19
19602,KRAMER," My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.",19
19603,JERRY, You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!,19
19604,GEORGE, She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.,19
19605,JERRY, So what now?,19
19606,GEORGE, I don't know.,19
19607,JERRY, Can we go out there?,19
19608,GEORGE, Where?,19
19609,JERRY, Woodhaven.,19
19610,GEORGE, We could.,19
19611,GEORGE, I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.,19
19612,JERRY," My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' ""where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?""",19
19613,GEORGE, I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.,19
19614,JERRY, That'd be great. There's no wrong answer.,19
19615,GEORGE, Potato,19
19616,JERRY, Tuberculosis,19
19617,GEORGE, Blanket,19
19618,JERRY, Leroy,19
19619,GEORGE, Grass,19
19620,JERRY, Tuberculosis,19
19621,GEORGE," Oh, boy. Here she comes.",19
19622,ELAINE," Oh, my god.",19
19623,ELAINE, KRAMER!,19
19624,KRAMER, Hey.,19
19625,ELAINE, WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON.,19
19626,KRAMER," Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.",19
19627,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby.",19
19628,ELAINE, It's invisible.,19
19629,KRAMER," So, is everything cool? or what?",19
19630,ELAINE," Well,",19
19631,ELAINE," The Truth!, You want The Truth?",19
19632,GEORGE," Oh, this is my friend Jerry.",19
19633,JERRY," Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.",19
19634,GEORGE," Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.",19
19635,GEORGE," No, that's not it at all.",19
19636,GEORGE," Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool ",19
19637,JERRY, Just chatting. Friendly.,19
19638,GEORGE," All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.",19
19639,GEORGE, What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.,19
19640,JERRY," It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?",19
19641,GEORGE," You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.",19
19642,GEORGE, Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.,19
19643,JERRY," He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.",19
19644,JERRY, there are no copies.,19
19645,JERRY, Who makes copies?,19
19646,ELAINE, The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.,19
19647,KRAMER," Oh,",19
19648,KRAMER," No, lets go to the couch...",19
19649,JERRY," Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.",19
19650,JERRY, Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.,19
19651,ELAINE, I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.,19
19652,JERRY, George?,19
19653,GEORGE, I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE,19
19654,KRAMER," Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?",19
19655,ELAINE," Yeah, I suppose I am.",19
19656,KRAMER," All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.",19
19657,JERRY, You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.,19
19658,GEORGE," Hey, I'm getting in on that.",19
19659,ELAINE, You know you're chippin' in.,19
19660,GEORGE, You're going that way anyway!,19
19661,JERRY," I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go ""Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!""",19
19662,JERRY," I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? ""You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks."" Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know",20
19663,ELAINE, Hi Mr. Seinfeld! ,20
19664,JERRY," Hey, there's the old man! ",20
19665,JERRY," Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.",20
19666,JERRY, What's the difference?,20
19667,JERRY, I don't wanna use your car.,20
19668,JERRY, Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?,20
19669,JERRY, So what would you do? You'd hitch?,20
19670,JERRY, I don't know. 25 bucks a day.,20
19671,JERRY," Oh, I didn't get the insurance.",20
19672,JERRY, You're not paying for it.,20
19673,JERRY, God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?,20
19674,JERRY, It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?,20
19675,JERRY,"  Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.",20
19676,ELAINE,"  Ooh, you have a lake?",20
19677,JERRY, The lake isn't real.,20
19678,JERRY, I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.,20
19679,ELAINE, I can't take your bedroom.,20
19680,ELAINE, I can't kick you out of your bed.,20
19681,JERRY, Ma.,20
19682,JERRY,  What about you?,20
19683,JERRY,  What about him?,20
19684,ELAINE," Yeah, I'll just stay in here. ",20
19685,JERRY," Na, that's not such a good idea.",20
19686,JERRY, Not now. She's right inside.,20
19687,JERRY, I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.,20
19688,JERRY, Well...,20
19689,JERRY," Shh! Nothing, nothing.",20
19690,JERRY,"  ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh  you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time.  We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.",20
19691,JERRY, I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.,20
19692,JERRY, I'm going for the record.,20
19693,JERRY," Oh, come on.",20
19694,JERRY, Nice to see you. This is Elaine.,20
19695,ELAINE, Hi. Nice to meet you.,20

19697,JERRY, We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.,20
19698,JERRY, For fun.,20
19699,JERRY, I don't think so.,20
19700,JERRY, What kind of pen is that?,20
19701,JERRY, Yeah.,20
19702,JERRY, Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?,20
19703,JERRY, Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.,20
19704,JERRY, Oh no.,20
19705,JERRY, I couldn't,20
19706,JERRY, I can't take it.,20
19707,JERRY," No, I'm not...",20
19708,JERRY, I cannot take it!,20
19709,JERRY, Are you sure?,20
19710,JERRY," O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!",20
19711,ELAINE," Mmm, nice to meet you.",20
19712,JERRY, Thanks again.,20
19713,JERRY, What he gave it to me.,20
19714,JERRY, He offered it to me.,20
19715,JERRY, I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?,20
19716,JERRY, He could have said,20
19717,JERRY," If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.",20
19718,JERRY," Well, he was wrong.",20
19719,JERRY, So you want me to return it?,20
19720,JERRY, Hey I don't even want the pen now!,20
19721,ELAINE," Here, let me see it.  Hey, it writes upside down.",20
19722,ELAINE, Come in.,20
19723,JERRY, Are you O.K. in here?,20
19724,ELAINE, Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?,20
19725,JERRY," It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.",20
19726,ELAINE, Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.,20
19727,JERRY, Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.,20
19728,ELAINE, I am never gonna fall asleep.,20
19729,JERRY," Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.",20
19730,ELAINE, How can they not put the air conditioning on?,20
19731,JERRY, They're nuts with temperature.,20
19732,ELAINE, This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.,20
19733,JERRY, How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?,20
19734,ELAINE," I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.",20
19735,JERRY," It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. ",20
19736,JERRY, Stay on Biscayne.,20
19737,JERRY, Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.,20
19738,JERRY, What's so special up here?,20
19739,ELAINE, Oh!,20
19740,ELAINE, My back.,20
19741,ELAINE, That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.,20
19742,JERRY, Then YOU would be hunched over.,20
19743,ELAINE, I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.,20
19744,JERRY, You can't go?,20
19745,ELAINE, You can go.,20
19746,JERRY, Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.,20
19747,JERRY, You sure?,20
19748,JERRY, We'll stay in a hotel tonight.,20
19749,ELAINE,  Yes!,20
19750,JERRY, Why don't you get a new sofa?,20
19751,JERRY, I'm buying you a new sofa.,20
19752,ELAINE," Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.",20
19753,ELAINE, I've lost 6 pounds.,20

19755,JERRY," Evelyn, this is Elaine.",20
19756,ELAINE,  Hi Evelyn.,20
19757,JERRY, Too thin?,20
19758,JERRY,  What?,20
19759,ELAINE, The astronauts use them.,20

19761,JERRY," No, no, I...",20
19762,ELAINE, Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!,20
19763,JERRY," All I said was ""I like the pen"".",20
19764,ELAINE," No no, I wanna go.",20
19765,ELAINE," Oh, oh, O.K.  You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.",20
19766,ELAINE, You're not too cold?,20
19767,JERRY, Don't be alarmed.,20
19768,JERRY, I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.,20
19769,JERRY,  How are you doing?,20
19770,ELAINE, Having a good time!,20
19771,JERRY, Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?,20
19772,JERRY, Well I started to go under...,20
19773,JERRY," Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.",20
19774,ELAINE, My back hurts.,20
19775,JERRY, I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.,20
19776,JERRY," Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.",20
19777,JERRY," I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. ",20
19778,JERRY, Take it.,20
19779,JERRY, What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?,20
19780,JERRY, Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?,20
19781,JERRY, Well. This should be a very interesting evening.,20
19782,ELAINE,  Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?,20

19788,JERRY, I've got a black eye.,20
19789,JERRY," Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.",20
19790,JERRY,  Her back hurts.,20
19791,JERRY," No, no.",20
19792,ELAINE,  STELLA! STELLA!,20
19793,JERRY, Dad!,20
19794,JERRY,  I can't. Nobody's even listening.,20
19795,JERRY,  Oh God!  huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? ,20
19796,JERRY,  Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?,20
19797,JERRY, Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?,20
19798,JERRY, All I said was I liked the pen!,20
19799,ELAINE,  STELLA!,20
19800,ELAINE, Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?,20
19801,JERRY, There must be some mistake.,20
19802,ELAINE,  Five days. Here.,20
19803,JERRY,  Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...,20
19804,ELAINE, Excuse me?,20
19805,JERRY, Nothing.,20
19806,JERRY, Hi Evelyn.,20
19807,ELAINE,  Five more days?,20
19808,JERRY, Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. ,20
19809,JERRY," Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going",20
19810,JERRY," So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!",21
19811,JERRY, Is he on the plane now?,21
19812,JERRY," Uh, just my next door neighbor.",21
19813,JERRY," Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?",21
19814,JERRY, What's the matter?,21
19815,JERRY, Huh? How you feeling?,21
19816,JERRY, Farfel?,21
19817,JERRY, The dog? The dog??,21
19818,JERRY," But, you know, what if, you know?",21
19819,JERRY, The dog?,21
19820,JERRY," Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up!  So what would you do?",21
19821,ELAINE," Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.",21
19822,ELAINE, If only.,21
19823,JERRY," Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.",21
19824,ELAINE," Hey, when you walk him, do ya...",21
19825,JERRY, Do I what?,21
19826,ELAINE, Do you pick it up?,21
19827,JERRY," Yes, I pick it up.",21
19828,ELAINE, You pick it up?!?,21
19829,JERRY, Well you have to.,21
19830,ELAINE," Oh, boy would I love to see that.",21
19831,JERRY," SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it!  I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?",21
19832,ELAINE," Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.",21
19833,JERRY," No, I tried. they don't know anything.  You gotta put the syrup in first.",21
19834,ELAINE," No, milk.",21
19835,JERRY," I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.",21
19836,ELAINE, What is a bender anyhow?,21
19837,JERRY," I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.",21
19838,ELAINE, I can't believe he hasn't called.,21
19839,JERRY," Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!",21
19840,KRAMER," Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.",21
19841,JERRY, Why?,21
19842,ELAINE," We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.",21
19843,KRAMER," I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.",21
19844,JERRY, You're breaking up?,21
19845,KRAMER," Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.",21
19846,ELAINE," Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.",21
19847,KRAMER," Woah, you didn't like her?",21
19848,ELAINE," If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.",21
19849,JERRY, I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.,21
19850,KRAMER, How come you never said anything?,21
19851,JERRY, Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.,21
19852,KRAMER, I tell you.,21
19853,JERRY, You. I'm talking about people.,21
19854,ELAINE, Are we still going to the movies tonight?,21
19855,JERRY," No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.",21
19856,ELAINE, Just me and George?,21
19857,JERRY, Sure.,21
19858,ELAINE, But we need you.,21
19859,JERRY, What do you need me for?,21
19860,ELAINE, Because... Yeah?,21
19861,GEORGE, Prognosis Negative! ,21
19862,ELAINE," Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?",21
19863,JERRY," No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!",21
19864,ELAINE, Just me and George alone?,21
19865,GEORGE," Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!",21
19866,JERRY, I can't go.,21
19867,GEORGE," Can't go, Why not?",21
19868,JERRY, Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.,21
19869,GEORGE, I thought Kramer was watching.,21
19870,JERRY, He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.,21
19871,GEORGE," Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.",21
19872,JERRY," No, I don't want that smell in the house.",21
19873,GEORGE, You spritz a little Lysol on it.,21
19874,JERRY," No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.",21
19875,GEORGE, So we're not going?,21
19876,JERRY, Nah. You two go.,21
19877,GEORGE, Oh. You still wanna go?,21
19878,ELAINE," Do, do you?",21
19879,GEORGE, If you want.,21
19880,ELAINE," It,s, it's up to you.",21
19881,JERRY, Go ahead.,21
19882,ELAINE," Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?",21
19883,GEORGE, Ponce de Leon? Okay.  You sure you don't wanna go?,21
19884,JERRY, I want to but I can't.,21
19885,ELAINE, Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.,21
19886,JERRY, No.,21
19887,GEORGE, What about this--,21
19888,JERRY," Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.",21
19889,ELAINE," I know, it's not that.",21
19890,GEORGE, It's just we want you to go.,21
19891,JERRY," Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!",21
19892,JERRY," On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?",21
19893,GEORGE, So how long did you live there?,21
19894,ELAINE, About three years.,21
19895,GEORGE, That's pretty long.,21
19896,ELAINE, Hmm.,21
19897,GEORGE," It's not that long, really.",21
19898,ELAINE, Yeah.,21
19899,GEORGE, And then you came here.,21
19900,ELAINE, Yeah. So I've been here about six years.,21
19901,JERRY," Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!",21
19902,KRAMER," I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.",21
19903,GEORGE, I like herbal tea.,21
19904,GEORGE, Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.,21
19905,ELAINE, Jerry likes Morning Thunder.,21
19906,GEORGE, Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?,21
19907,ELAINE, Yeah.,21
19908,GEORGE," Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.",21
19909,ELAINE, Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.,21
19910,GEORGE, You don't tell him?,21
19911,ELAINE, No.,21
19912,GEORGE, That is so funny!,21
19913,ELAINE, I know!,21
19914,GEORGE," Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!",21
19915,KRAMER," Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!",21
19916,JERRY," That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much.  That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!",21
19917,ELAINE, It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.,21
19918,JERRY," Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.",21
19919,ELAINE, The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.,21
19920,JERRY," Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down.  What?",21
19921,ELAINE, Do you have to?,21
19922,JERRY, What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.,21
19923,ELAINE," You know, the guy might have just lost your number.",21
19924,JERRY, I'm in the book and I have a machine.,21
19925,ELAINE," Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.",21
19926,JERRY, Really? How late are they open?,21
19927,JERRY, What?,21
19928,ELAINE, What is it?,21
19929,KRAMER, I went back with Ellen.,21
19930,ELAINE, Terrific.,21
19931,JERRY," Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.",21
19932,ELAINE," Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.",21
19933,KRAMER, Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?,21
19934,JERRY," Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.",21
19935,KRAMER," From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.",21
19936,ELAINE," Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.",21
19937,JERRY, What are you doing?,21
19938,KRAMER, I'm getting my pot.,21
19939,ELAINE," Kramer, we like her.",21
19940,JERRY, Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?,21
19941,ELAINE, I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.,21
19942,JERRY," I said, ""How come no one's killed her?"" Probably shouldn't have said anything,",21
19943,JERRY, Well.,21
19944,ELAINE, Well.,21
19945,JERRY, everyone knows the first break-up never takes.  Yeah?,21
19946,GEORGE, Prognosis Negative! ,21
19947,JERRY," Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.",21
19948,ELAINE," Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.",21
19949,JERRY," It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.",21
19950,ELAINE," Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.",21
19951,JERRY," I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?",21
19952,ELAINE, We'll see it Sunday.,21
19953,GEORGE," Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?",21
19954,ELAINE," I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.",21
19955,GEORGE, What does this mean?,21
19956,JERRY," Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.",21
19957,GEORGE," What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.",21
19958,JERRY," She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.",21
19959,GEORGE," Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?",21
19960,JERRY," I don't know, regular human time?",21
19961,GEORGE, Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?,21
19962,JERRY, Why shouldn't I go here?,21
19963,ELAINE," Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.",21
19964,GEORGE, And isn't it more fun using the urinal?,21
19965,ELAINE, Yeah.,21
19966,JERRY," Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!",21
19967,GEORGE," Hey, go.",21
19968,ELAINE, Who's stopping you?,21
19969,GEORGE," What, are you doing me a favor?",21
19970,ELAINE, Like we care if you go to the bathroom.,21
19971,GEORGE, How's it going?,21
19972,ELAINE, Good. Good. You?,21
19973,GEORGE, Things are good.,21
19974,ELAINE," Boy, he takes such a long time.",21
19975,GEORGE, I know.,21
19976,ELAINE, You know what he does in there? He gargles.,21
19977,GEORGE, Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?,21
19978,ELAINE," Yeah, he does it like six times a day.",21
19979,GEORGE, How come we never hear him?,21
19980,ELAINE," Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.",21
19981,GEORGE," Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!",21
19982,ELAINE, We talked about that already.,21
19983,GEORGE, Oh.,21
19984,GEORGE, I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.,21
19985,JERRY, So what are calling me six times a day?,21
19986,GEORGE," All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.",21
19987,JERRY, I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.,21
19988,GEORGE, Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.,21
19989,JERRY," It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?",21
19990,GEORGE, Nothing except Prognosis Negative.,21
19991,JERRY," Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.",21
19992,ELAINE," Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!",21
19993,ELAINE," Shut up. Shut up!  Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.",21
19994,GEORGE," I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.",21
19995,JERRY, I don't know what to do.,21
19996,GEORGE," What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.",21
19997,JERRY," I know, I know.",21
19998,GEORGE," So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.",21
19999,JERRY, It is kind of silly.,21
20000,GEORGE, Of course it is.,21
20001,JERRY," I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.",21
20002,GEORGE, Exactly.,21
20003,JERRY, It's not like she's *in* the movie.,21
20004,GEORGE, Right.,21
20005,JERRY," Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.",21
20006,GEORGE," And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.",21
20007,JERRY," How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.",21
20008,GEORGE, Good.,21
20009,JERRY, Saving movies.,21
20010,GEORGE, Ridiculous!,21
20011,JERRY, Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.,21
20012,GEORGE," Oh, you're dead.",21
20013,JERRY," You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.",21
20014,KRAMER," Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!",21
20015,KRAMER, Hey you keep that mutt away from me.,21
20016,JERRY," Oh, hi Ellen.",21
20017,JERRY," Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...",21
20018,JERRY, Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.,21
20019,ELAINE, We made plans.,21
20020,JERRY, Why don't we just rent a movie?,21
20021,ELAINE, I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.,21
20022,JERRY," No, it&Mac226s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...",21
20023,ELAINE," Jerry, you promised me we'd go.",21
20024,JERRY," Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.",21
20025,ELAINE," Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.",21
20026,JERRY, You and George got together?,21
20027,ELAINE," Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.",21
20028,JERRY, Hello.,21
20029,KRAMER," Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.",21
20030,JERRY, What's up?,21
20031,KRAMER," Well, ah you were right.",21
20032,JERRY, About what?,21
20033,KRAMER," Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.",21
20034,JERRY, Too bad.,21
20035,ELAINE, I thought she was the one.,21
20036,KRAMER, I'll bring back the pot.,21
20037,ELAINE," Okay, c'mon it's movie time.",21
20038,KRAMER," Hey, what are you gonna see?",21
20039,JERRY, Prognosis Negative.,21
20040,KRAMER," Hey, that's supposed to be great.",21
20041,JERRY, It's not.,21
20042,KRAMER, How do you know?,21
20043,JERRY, I have an instinct for these things.,21
20044,JERRY," I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, ""Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me."" But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?",21
20045,JERRY," Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'",22
20046,JERRY, Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?,22
20047,KRAMER, enters,22
20048,JERRY," Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.",22
20049,KRAMER, What's the problem?,22
20050,JERRY, This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.,22
20051,KRAMER," Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000",22
20052,JERRY, It doesn't work like that.,22
20053,KRAMER," If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000",22
20054,JERRY, It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...,22
20055,JERRY, That orange dress is burned in my memory,22
20056,KRAMER," Oh, memory burn.",22
20057,JERRY, I wonder what ever happened to her.,22
20058,KRAMER, How did they ever find you?,22
20059,JERRY," Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.",22
20060,JERRY, It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library,22
20061,KRAMER, You know I never got a library card.,22
20062,JERRY,  Coming down.,22
20063,KRAMER," It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,",22
20064,JERRY, I gotta go to the library. You want to go?,22
20065,KRAMER," Yeah,",22
20066,KRAMER," The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.													JERRY",22
20067,KRAMER, Tryin' to save a quarter.,22
20068,JERRY, I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.,22
20069,JERRY, This woman's completely ignoring me.,22
20070,KRAMER, Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.,22
20071,JERRY, Eventually a little shot of penicillin,22
20072,JERRY, Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.,22
20073,KRAMER," Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?",22
20074,KRAMER," That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.",22
20075,JERRY, Can I speak with this Bookman?,22
20076,GEORGE," Jerry, Jerry",22
20077,JERRY, What?,22
20078,GEORGE, I think I saw him. I think it's him.,22
20079,JERRY, Who?,22
20080,GEORGE, Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine,22
20081,JERRY, Yeah.,22
20082,KRAMER, yeah,22
20083,GEORGE, I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.,22
20084,JERRY,"  Haymen, Are you sure?",22
20085,GEORGE," He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.",22
20086,JERRY, George got him fired. He squealed on him.,22
20087,KRAMER, Ooh tattle tale,22
20088,GEORGE,  I didn't tattle,22
20089,KRAMER, What did this guy do? What happened?,22
20090,GEORGE, There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.,22
20091,KRAMER," Oh come on, You can tell me.",22
20092,GEORGE, Some other time.,22
20093,KRAMER, What tonight?,22
20094,KRAMER, Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.,22
20095,JERRY," Oh, he sang like a canary.",22
20096,JERRY, Not here? Why was I told to come down here?,22
20097,KRAMER, He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?,22
20098,JERRY, Well what am I supposed to do now?,22
20099,JERRY, All right Thanks. Come on lets go,22
20100,GEORGE, Let's see if it's Hayman?,22
20101,KRAMER," Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later.  So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?",22
20102,ELAINE, Where's Karen?,22
20103,ELAINE," Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.",22
20104,ELAINE, How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?,22
20105,ELAINE," Ah, you don't know anything. You see, ""I don't know anything"", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said ""You're crazy.""",22
20106,ELAINE," Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.",22
20107,ELAINE," Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?",22
20108,ELAINE," Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.",22
20109,ELAINE, I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.,22
20110,JERRY, So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!,22
20111,ELAINE," What do you know. You've never worked in an office.  See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!",22
20112,GEORGE," I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?",22
20113,ELAINE, What did he do?,22
20114,GEORGE," He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, ""Costanza"" He'd say, ""Can't stand ja"". ""Can't stand ja"" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.",22
20115,JERRY," I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...",22
20116,GEORGE," OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.",22
20117,JERRY, I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.,22
20118,GEORGE, Little baked beans,22
20119,JERRY, Echh,22
20120,ELAINE, Come on tell me what happened.,22
20121,GEORGE," Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!",22
20122,GEORGE, ... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...,22
20123,GEORGE," Yes, Mr. Hayman",22
20124,GEORGE, Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.,22
20125,GEORGE," I'm not really sure, I...",22
20126,GEORGE, He gave me a wedgie.,22
20127,JERRY, He got fired the next day.,22
20128,ELAINE, Why do they call it a wedgie?,22
20129,GEORGE, Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..,22
20130,JERRY, They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.,22
20131,ELAINE, Boys are sick.,22
20132,JERRY, Well what do girls do ?,22
20133,ELAINE, We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.,22
20134,GEORGE, I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226m the guy who ruined his life.,22
20135,KRAMER," Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.",22
20136,JERRY," What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?",22
20137,JERRY," Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?",22
20138,JERRY, Coffee?,22
20139,JERRY," No, I don't drink coffee.",22
20140,JERRY," No, I don't have--",22
20141,JERRY," Well, I don't normally--",22
20142,JERRY, I don't.,22
20143,JERRY, Really? I'll have to remember that.,22
20144,JERRY," Yes, and I returned it in 1971.",22
20145,JERRY," Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.",22
20146,JERRY, I try.,22
20147,JERRY," No, I don't.",22
20148,JERRY, Certainly not.,22
20149,KRAMER, What's wrong?,22
20150,KRAMER," So I, I didn't do anything wrong.",22
20151,KRAMER, Why don't ya' leave?,22
20152,JERRY," No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it.  Becker, ... Becker, ...",22
20153,JERRY," So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?",22
20154,JERRY, Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?,22
20155,JERRY, No Black Jack?,22
20156,JERRY, Tropic of Cancer.,22
20157,JERRY, Tropic of Capricorn?,22
20158,JERRY, Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.,22
20159,JERRY," George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.",22
20160,GEORGE," Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it",22
20161,JERRY," Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.",22
20162,JERRY, It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go.  It was GEORGE!,22
20163,KRAMER, Read another poem.,22
20164,KRAMER," Wow, that is great. You should be published.",22
20165,KRAMER," You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.",22
20166,KRAMER, HELLO!,22
20167,KRAMER, HELLO!,22
20168,ELAINE, Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good,22
20169,JERRY, Maybe you're getting' a raise.,22
20170,ELAINE, Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.,22
20171,ELAINE, What?,22
20172,GEORGE, It's George,22
20173,ELAINE, George is on his way up.,22
20174,JERRY, Wait 'til I tell him about the book.,22
20175,KRAMER,  sobs,22
20176,ELAINE, Are you OK? What? What?,22
20177,KRAMER, It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it ,22
20178,ELAINE, Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT,22
20179,JERRY, I'm right here.,22
20180,ELAINE, Remember that Columbus book?,22
20181,JERRY," Columbus, Euro trash.",22
20182,GEORGE," Well, it's definetly him.",22
20183,ELAINE, Him? Him who?,22
20184,GEORGE, Him who? Hayman him.,22
20185,ELAINE, Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?,22
20186,GEORGE," Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus",22
20187,JERRY, That was double overtime.,22
20188,GEORGE," So I said, ""Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... "" He doesn't move. So I said uh, ""Can't stand ya'"", ""Can't stand ya'"" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.",22
20189,ELAINE, At least it wasn't atomic.,22
20190,GEORGE, It was.,22
20191,JERRY," So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER",22
20192,GEORGE, How should I know?,22
20193,JERRY, Because I gave it to you.,22
20194,GEORGE, Me?,22
20195,JERRY," Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.",22
20196,GEORGE, The locker room!,22
20197,JERRY, Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.,22
20198,GEORGE," Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.",22
20199,JERRY," All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.",22
20200,GEORGE, Yes Mr. Hayman.,22
20201,GEORGE, Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.,22
20202,GEORGE," I'm not really sure, I...",22
20203,GEORGE,  No No No!,22
20204,JERRY," Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.",22
20205,JERRY, What is your problem?,22
20206,JERRY, That is one tough monkey!  So you were saying?,22
20207,ELAINE," Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.",22
20208,JERRY," Oh, beautiful did he like them?",22
20209,ELAINE," No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!",22
20210,JERRY,  Was he out there?,22
20211,GEORGE," Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.",22
20212,JERRY, I guess we'll never know.,22
20213,JERRY," Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' ""Where's your jock strap?"" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.",22
20214,GEORGE, One left...what a joke.,23
20215,KRAMER, You can have this one.,23
20216,GEORGE," No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.",23
20217,ELAINE," Hey, I didn't get one either.",23
20218,JERRY, Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?,23
20219,ELAINE, This is what people do.,23
20220,JERRY, No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.,23
20221,GEORGE, You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.,23
20222,ELAINE, So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?,23
20223,GEORGE, Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.,23
20224,JERRY, Big accomplishment.,23
20225,GEORGE, Fish. What do they do?,23
20226,ELAINE, What do you do?,23
20227,KRAMER, It's this way.,23
20228,GEORGE, What time is it?,23
20229,JERRY, Five o'clock.,23
20230,GEORGE, Always late. Always late.,23
20231,JERRY, You're not late.,23
20232,GEORGE, I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.,23
20233,ELAINE, Who?,23
20234,GEORGE, My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?,23
20235,JERRY, Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.,23
20236,ELAINE, Isn't it going the other way?,23
20237,JERRY, There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.,23
20238,ELAINE, But it's Saturday.,23
20239,JERRY, You got the picnic and burger traffic.,23
20240,GEORGE, I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.,23
20241,ELAINE, What's the matter?,23
20242,JERRY, I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?,23
20243,JERRY,  You want me to help you with that?,23
20244,KRAMER," No, no, I got it.",23
20245,JERRY,"  What do you think, Georgie boy?",23
20246,GEORGE," Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.",23
20247,KRAMER," If you like her, go talk to her.",23
20248,GEORGE," Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, ""Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?"" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.",23
20249,KRAMER, She's fat.,23
20250,ELAINE, Oh she's fat?,23
20251,ELAINE, What? JERRY Where's the car?,23
20252,KRAMER, I thought it was here.,23
20253,GEORGE, You don't know where we parked?,23
20254,GEORGE," Oh, this is great.",23
20255,KRAMER, Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.,23
20256,JERRY, I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.,23
20257,ELAINE, I didn't pay attention.,23
20258,GEORGE, This is just what I need.,23
20259,ELAINE, I'm sure it's right around here.,23
20260,KRAMER, It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.,23
20261,GEORGE, There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.,23
20262,JERRY, It's over there. I know where it is.,23
20263,ELAINE," It's black, right?",23
20264,KRAMER, Dark blue.,23
20265,GEORGE,"  You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?",23
20266,JERRY," There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.",23
20267,JERRY,  Hmmm...I thought it was...,23
20268,KRAMER, Didn't we come in over there?,23
20269,JERRY, I thought it was over there.,23
20270,ELAINE, How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?,23
20271,KRAMER, About two hours.,23
20272,ELAINE,  You'd better find this car.,23
20273,GEORGE," It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF",23
20274,JERRY, I really have to go to the bathroom.,23
20275,KRAMER, Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J,23
20276,KRAMER,  Why? Nobody's around.,23
20277,JERRY, I'll wait.,23
20278,KRAMER, You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.,23
20279,JERRY, Alright.,23
20280,KRAMER," Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?",23
20281,JERRY, Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.,23
20282,ELAINE,  There it is!...No that's not it.,23
20283,ELAINE,"  Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.",23
20284,GEORGE, ...Six wrong?,23
20285,ELAINE, Those school zones are a killer.,23
20286,JERRY,  Will you let me help you with that?,23
20287,KRAMER, I'm gonna put it down behind that car.,23
20288,JERRY, You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?,23
20289,KRAMER,  Pink eleven. Remember that.,23
20290,GEORGE," Oh I got it.  That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.",23
20291,ELAINE,  I think they're laboring.,23
20292,KRAMER, Look at this place. It's huge...,23
20293,GEORGE," I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.",23
20294,JERRY," Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, ""Make sure you hang on to your jacket.""",23
20295,GEORGE," Where the hell is this car, Kramer?",23
20296,KRAMER, It's got to be here.,23
20297,ELAINE, Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.,23
20298,JERRY, Maybe it's not on this level.,23
20299,GEORGE, What?,23
20300,JERRY, There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?,23
20301,ELAINE, It felt like a couple of levels.,23
20302,JERRY, You should always carry a pad and pen.,23
20303,GEORGE, I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.,23
20304,KRAMER, I have a pen.,23
20305,JERRY," Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, ""Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms.""",23
20306,ELAINE, Look at that woman.,23
20307,GEORGE,"  Hey, is that necessary?",23
20308,GEORGE, I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.,23
20309,GEORGE, ...What?,23
20310,GEORGE, You are!,23
20311,GEORGE, I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.,23
20312,KRAMER,  I found it!,23
20313,ELAINE, He's got it.,23
20314,KRAMER, Oh...no.,23
20315,JERRY," All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?",23
20316,ELAINE," Jerry, look at my fish.",23
20317,JERRY, His eyes look a little cloudy.,23
20318,GEORGE, Oh are they gonna be furious.,23
20319,JERRY, Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do.  I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!,23
20320,KRAMER, It was easy the last time.,23
20321,ELAINE, My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.,23
20322,JERRY, No one's going to do that.,23
20323,ELAINE," Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.",23
20324,ELAINE, Five minutes.,23
20325,ELAINE, We're not wilding.,23
20326,ELAINE,  Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...,23
20327,ELAINE,  Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny,23
20328,JERRY, Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?,23
20329,KRAMER, Right here at the mall.,23
20330,ELAINE, Excuse me...,23
20331,ELAINE,"  Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.",23
20332,JERRY, It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.,23
20333,KRAMER, You drank a whole bottle of water.,23
20334,JERRY, I know.,23
20335,KRAMER, So why don't you just go?,23
20336,JERRY, No I can't.,23
20337,KRAMER, Don't you get tired of following rules?,23
20338,JERRY, You think I'm too cautious?,23
20339,KRAMER, Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.,23
20340,JERRY, Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.,23
20341,KRAMER, Buddy Hackett?,23
20342,JERRY, He's a comedian.,23
20343,KRAMER, I know.,23
20344,JERRY, All right. All right.,23
20345,KRAMER,  You can go over here.,23
20346,JERRY, I can manage.,23
20347,KRAMER,  George! ,23
20348,KRAMER, It'll take you ten seconds.,23
20349,JERRY," Okay, okay. I'll be right back.",23
20350,JERRY, But...,23
20351,JERRY,  ...Kramer,23
20352,JERRY," I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.",23
20353,JERRY," Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?",23
20354,JERRY, So you don't care if I die.,23
20355,JERRY, It was life and death.,23
20356,JERRY, Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.,23
20357,JERRY," Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.",23
20358,JERRY,"  Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.",23
20359,KRAMER,  Jerry!,23
20360,ELAINE, Jerry!,23
20361,GEORGE," Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.",23
20362,ELAINE, Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.,23
20363,GEORGE, Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.,23
20364,GEORGE," If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.",23
20365,ELAINE," No, no, I'll be back.",23
20366,GEORGE, Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.,23
20367,KRAMER, Does that bother you?,23
20368,GEORGE," Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?",23
20369,KRAMER, Not at all.,23
20370,GEORGE," See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?",23
20371,KRAMER, I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.,23
20372,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?",23
20373,JERRY, First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.,23
20374,JERRY," Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.",23
20375,JERRY,  And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.,23
20376,JERRY, You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.,23
20377,ELAINE," And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.",23
20378,ELAINE, But why? Why can't you do it?,23
20379,ELAINE," No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.",23
20380,ELAINE, But why? Why don't you want to?,23
20381,ELAINE, But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?,23
20382,JERRY,"  All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.",23
20383,JERRY,"  What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.",23
20384,KRAMER, The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.,23
20385,GEORGE,  Really.,23
20386,KRAMER, What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?,23
20387,GEORGE, Who's Killer Kowalski?,23
20388,KRAMER, He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.,23
20389,GEORGE, I've gotta go to the bathroom.,23
20390,KRAMER, So go. GEORGE Here?,23
20391,KRAMER,  You and Jerry.,23
20392,GEORGE, Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...,23
20393,JERRY,  Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?,23
20394,GEORGE,  A Red Chinese prison?,23
20395,KRAMER, George! George!,23
20396,ELAINE, Jerry! ,23
20397,JERRY," Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.",23
20398,JERRY," Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.",23
20399,ELAINE,  Jerry! JERRY Elaine?!,23
20400,ELAINE,  Jerry! Over here...,23
20401,ELAINE,  Where have you been?,23
20402,JERRY, I was arrested for urinating.,23
20403,GEORGE,  Me too.,23
20404,ELAINE, You what?,23
20405,JERRY, I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.,23
20406,ELAINE, Look at my fish...  Is he...,23
20407,JERRY," No, but he's not looking good... ",23
20408,ELAINE,"  Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.",23
20409,ELAINE," I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?",23
20410,ELAINE," That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.",23
20411,ELAINE,  That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?,23
20412,GEORGE," Elaine, shut-up.",23
20413,JERRY," Hey, where's Kramer?",23
20414,GEORGE, I don't know.  Where's Kramer?,23
20415,ELAINE, I thought he was with you.,23
20416,GEORGE," See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...",23
20417,GEORGE,"  Look at the time, that's it.",23
20418,ELAINE, Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?,23
20419,GEORGE, We came in over there!,23
20420,ELAINE, We didn't come in over there!,23
20421,JERRY, Where's Kramer?,23
20422,JERRY," Hey George, there she is again. ...",23
20423,GEORGE, So what do you want me to do?,23
20424,JERRY, Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.,23
20425,GEORGE, That is an opening.,23
20426,GEORGE,"  Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...",23
20427,GEORGE, You will?,23
20428,GEORGE, Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.,23
20429,GEORGE," Yeah, right.",23
20430,JERRY, Filthy pigs.,23
20431,GEORGE, It's a blue Honda...,23
20432,ELAINE," Hi, I'm Elaine.",23
20433,JERRY, Jerry.,23
20434,ELAINE, It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.,23
20435,GEORGE," Hi Amy, I'm George.",23
20436,GEORGE,  I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...,23
20437,GEORGE,  ...with that group.,23
20438,ELAINE,  What about my fish?,23
20439,JERRY," Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.",23
20440,ELAINE, I'll say.,23
20441,ELAINE, What is it?  The car!,23
20442,JERRY, The car!,23
20443,GEORGE, The car!,23
20444,ELAINE, We found it. I can't believe it!,23
20445,GEORGE," Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen.  Kramer! Kramer!",23
20446,JERRY, Kramer!,23
20447,JERRY, Kramer.,23
20448,KRAMER, Jerry?,23
20449,JERRY," Yeah, over here.",23
20450,KRAMER, Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?,23
20451,GEORGE, Purple 23.,23
20452,KRAMER, Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.,23
20453,GEORGE, Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.,23
20454,KRAMER, What time is it?,23
20455,GEORGE, Seven forty-five.,23
20456,KRAMER, Well at least there's no traffic.,23
20457,GEORGE, Right.,23
20458,KRAMER, What time does that play start?,23
20459,GEORGE, Eight o'clock.,23
20460,KRAMER, That might be a problem.  Where's your little bag of...,23
20461,KRAMER,  Oh... Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?,23
20462,GEORGE," She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't nice.",24
20463,JERRY," This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.",24
20464,GEORGE," Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?",24
20465,JERRY, What's that smell? What are you wearing?,24
20466,GEORGE," What, a 'little' cologne.",24
20467,JERRY, Manly.,24
20468,GEORGE, Monica wants me to wear it.,24
20469,JERRY, So why didn't you say no?,24
20470,GEORGE, I'm too nice.,24
20471,JERRY, Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.,24
20472,GEORGE, She wants me to take an IQ test.,24
20473,JERRY, That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.,24
20474,GEORGE," No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.",24
20475,JERRY," I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.",24
20476,GEORGE," You know, I can't talk to you anymore.",24
20477,JERRY," All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.",24
20478,GEORGE," Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.",24
20479,JERRY, Who thinks you're smart?,24
20480,GEORGE, I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.,24
20481,JERRY, What thing?,24
20482,GEORGE, You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!,24
20483,JERRY," Oh, Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.",24
20484,GEORGE, I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.,24
20485,JERRY, What'd ya get?,24
20486,GEORGE, What did I get or what do I say I got?,24
20487,JERRY, What do you say?,24
20488,GEORGE, I say fourteen o nine .,24
20489,JERRY," 1409, that's a good score.",24
20490,GEORGE," Psst, You're telling me.",24
20491,JERRY, What did you really get?,24
20492,GEORGE, You are my friend.,24
20493,JERRY, Of course.,24
20494,GEORGE," I tell you everything, right?",24
20495,JERRY, I hope so.,24
20496,GEORGE," Well, this I take to the grave.													 													 ",24
20497,JERRY," He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.",24
20498,ELAINE, Why do you keep watching?,24
20499,JERRY," I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for  survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for  him for a second.",24
20500,ELAINE, And then you flush.,24
20501,JERRY," Well, it's a spider.",24
20502,ELAINE," You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.",24
20503,ELAINE," Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.",24
20504,JERRY, Bazooka Joe.,24
20505,JERRY, The buzzer.,24
20506,ELAINE, It's your house.,24
20507,JERRY, My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? ,24
20508,JERRY, Come on up.,24
20509,ELAINE, Casus belli.,24
20510,JERRY, What's that?,24
20511,ELAINE," It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.",24
20512,JERRY," Come on, Go in, go in!  [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]",24
20513,ELAINE, Have you gone in there?,24
20514,JERRY," No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.",24
20515,GEORGE, Hey.,24
20516,JERRY," You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.",24
20517,GEORGE," I'm wearing some cologne, all right?",24
20518,ELAINE," Sure, fine.",24
20519,JERRY, Casus belli.,24
20520,ELAINE, Casus belli.,24
20521,GEORGE, What's that?,24
20522,ELAINE, Since when do you wear cologne?,24
20523,GEORGE," Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.",24
20524,JERRY," Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?",24
20525,GEORGE," I didn't take it, yet.",24
20526,ELAINE, What IQ test?,24
20527,GEORGE, What's casus belli.,24
20528,JERRY," Oh, it's nothing...",24
20529,GEORGE, Is it about me?,24
20530,JERRY, Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be?  Why can't you live?,24
20531,ELAINE," It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?",24
20532,JERRY, This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.,24
20533,ELAINE," Oh, that sounds like fun.",24
20534,GEORGE," Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.",24
20535,ELAINE," You'll do well, you're smart.",24
20536,JERRY," No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.",24
20537,ELAINE, Wha'd you get on your SAT's?,24
20538,GEORGE, It varies.,24
20539,JERRY," You know, I don't even know my IQ.",24
20540,ELAINE," huh, Mine's 145.",24
20541,GEORGE, 145!,24
20542,JERRY, Get out of here!,24
20543,ELAINE, You get out of here!,24
20544,JERRY, You get out of here!,24
20545,ELAINE, Huhuhuhuhuhuhu ,24
20546,GEORGE," Shst, You should take the test for me.",24
20547,ELAINE, Huh.,24
20548,JERRY," Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.",24
20549,GEORGE, Haha ,24
20550,JERRY," Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that.  ",24
20551,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?",24
20552,ELAINE, What?,24
20553,GEORGE," You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.",24
20554,ELAINE, Are you serious?,24
20555,GEORGE, Why not?,24
20556,ELAINE, Where would I take the test?,24
20557,GEORGE," I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.",24
20558,ELAINE," No, that'd be too noisy.",24
20559,JERRY," Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.",24
20560,ELAINE," Hey, what do you think?",24
20561,JERRY," Hey, I love a good caper.",24
20562,ELAINE," Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.",24
20563,GEORGE, You'll do it?,24
20564,ELAINE, What the hey.,24
20565,GEORGE," Yeaah, beautiful...  Sorry...													 													 ",24
20566,JERRY," Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.",24
20567,JERRY," Eh, people, people are talking.",24
20568,JERRY," Ah, non-smoking would be great.",24
20569,JERRY, Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.],24
20570,JERRY," Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?",24
20571,JERRY," Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.",24
20572,JERRY,"  Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?													 													 ",24
20573,GEORGE, You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.,24
20574,GEORGE," I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.",24
20575,GEORGE, Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.,24
20576,GEORGE," Well, I think you're wrong about that.  [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.",24
20577,GEORGE, Don't need it. N'huhuhu ,24
20578,ELAINE, What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.,24
20579,GEORGE," I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.",24
20580,ELAINE," All right, what time do you want me back here.",24
20581,GEORGE," Ah, ah, twenty to three.",24
20582,ELAINE, Ok.,24
20583,GEORGE, Thanks again.,24
20584,ELAINE, All right.,24
20585,GEORGE," A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh ",24
20586,JERRY, Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.,24
20587,JERRY," Oh, please...",24
20588,ELAINE," Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. ",24
20589,JERRY, Eat something! Babu...,24
20590,ELAINE," Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.",24
20591,JERRY," Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.",24
20592,ELAINE, I know.,24
20593,KRAMER, Hey.,24
20594,JERRY, Hey.,24
20595,KRAMER, Oh boy. Woop...,24
20596,KRAMER," Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine...  ",24
20597,ELAINE, Hey.,24
20598,KRAMER," This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.",24
20599,JERRY, So?,24
20600,KRAMER," Well, I'm not giving it back.",24
20601,JERRY, Why not?,24
20602,KRAMER," Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?",24
20603,KRAMER," Oh, gees...",24

21020,JERRY," I know, George told me.",25
21021,ELAINE, You told him!!!!,25
21022,GEORGE, He..He threatened me.,25
21023,JERRY, Where did you come up with all that stuff?,25
21024,ELAINE, That was nothing.,25
21025,GEORGE, Elaine.. I have to tell you something...,25

21036,KRAMER," Wait.. Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.",25
21037,ELAINE, Aah....  I think I'll get going...,25
21038,GEORGE, Heuh. huh. Stick around a while.,25
21039,JERRY, It's early.,25
21040,KRAMER, We'll order Chinese.,25
21041,GEORGE, Where'd you meet her?,26
21042,JERRY, I met her on an elevator.,26
21043,GEORGE, On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?,26
21044,JERRY," Impossible, right?",26
21045,GEORGE, You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?,26
21046,JERRY," I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.",26
21047,GEORGE, Wow. What'd you say?,26
21048,JERRY," You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.",26
21049,GEORGE, Wow.,26
21050,JERRY, Can you believe I did that?,26
21051,GEORGE, What did she say?,26
21052,JERRY, Not a good sign.,26
21053,GEORGE, Not everybody knows what the crop circles are.  Do you know what the crop circles are?,26
21054,JERRY, You got something in your teeth there.,26
21055,GEORGE, What?,26
21056,JERRY, It's green.,26
21057,GEORGE," Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.",26
21058,JERRY, Did you bump into anybody you knew?,26
21059,GEORGE, I had a job interview.,26
21060,JERRY, How'd it go?,26
21061,GEORGE, Take a guess.,26
21062,GEORGE," Ok, thanks.",26
21063,JERRY," What do you need a job, you got Audrey.",26
21064,GEORGE," Yeah, right.",26
21065,JERRY, What's the matter?,26
21066,GEORGE," Oh, nothing.",26
21067,JERRY, What?,26
21068,GEORGE, You won't think I'm a bad person?,26
21069,JERRY, Too late for that.,26
21070,GEORGE," 'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.",26
21071,JERRY," Yeah, she's got a big nose.",26
21072,GEORGE," I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.",26
21073,JERRY, It's a schnoz.,26
21074,GEORGE," Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.",26
21075,JERRY, A little.,26
21076,GEORGE," So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.",26
21077,JERRY, Stop being so concerned with looks.,26
21078,JERRY, Have you said anything to her about it?,26
21079,GEORGE," I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.",26
21080,JERRY," Alright, shut up, here they come.",26
21081,GEORGE,  How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.,26
21082,KRAMER," So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.",26
21083,ELAINE, Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?,26
21084,KRAMER," No no, he's never met her. She's in California.",26
21085,ELAINE, Are you coming with me?,26
21086,KRAMER," Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fiancé, Peter Von Nostrand.",26
21087,GEORGE, Why don't you just commit yourself already?,26
21088,ELAINE, He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.,26
21089,KRAMER," Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.",26
21090,GEORGE," What, you didn't wash all day?",26
21091,KRAMER," Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.",26
21092,KRAMER," Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.",26
21093,ELAINE, Kramer!,26
21094,KRAMER, What? What?,26
21095,ELAINE, How could you say something like that?!,26
21096,KRAMER, What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.,26
21097,ELAINE," No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.",26
21098,ELAINE, What did you have to say that for?,26
21099,KRAMER," Well, I was just trying to help out.",26
21100,ELAINE," Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.",26
21101,KRAMER, You see what happens when you try to be nice?,26
21102,GEORGE, Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?,26
21103,GEORGE," Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind.  So how about that Kramer, huh?",26
21104,GEORGE, They way he just says stuff.,26
21105,GEORGE," Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.",26
21106,GEORGE, About the pizza?,26
21107,GEORGE," Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?",26
21108,GEORGE," Yeah.  Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.",26
21109,GEORGE, Peter Jennings had one.,26
21110,GEORGE," Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...",26
21111,GEORGE," It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.",26
21112,GEORGE, It's a cleaning.,26
21113,GEORGE," If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this",26
21114,GEORGE, What the hell.,26
21115,ELAINE,"  Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?",26
21116,GEORGE, Me? I didn't say anything.,26
21117,ELAINE, You encouraged her to get one.,26
21118,GEORGE, I didn't encourage. No encourage.,26
21119,ELAINE, Peter Jennings had one?,26
21120,GEORGE, It's possible.,26
21121,ELAINE," Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.",26
21122,ELAINE, I think it's a mistake.,26
21123,GEORGE," Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.",26
21124,GEORGE," I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.",26
21125,JERRY," Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.",26
21126,GEORGE,"  Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.",26
21127,JERRY, We have time.,26
21128,GEORGE," It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.",26
21129,JERRY, It is exciting.,26
21130,GEORGE," Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...",26
21131,JERRY," Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.",26
21132,GEORGE, You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.,26
21133,JERRY, Then what?,26
21134,GEORGE, He still wins but it's not a blowout.,26
21135,JERRY," She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.",26
21136,JERRY,"  I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.",26
21137,KRAMER,  I'm proud of you.,26
21138,JERRY," So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.",26
21139,GEORGE, Good for you.,26
21140,JERRY," I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.",26
21141,GEORGE, It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.,26
21142,JERRY, It's not like that at all.,26
21143,ELAINE, How do you even know the jacket is there?,26
21144,KRAMER," Well I don't, I'm guessing.",26
21145,GEORGE," Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,",26
21146,GEORGE, Yeah?,26
21147,JERRY," Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.",26
21148,ELAINE, Are you sure you want us here for this?,26
21149,JERRY, Shouldn't a doctor do it?,26
21150,GEORGE," Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.",26
21151,ELAINE, It looks good.,26
21152,JERRY, Great job.,26
21153,KRAMER, You got butchered.,26
21154,JERRY, Let's put him over here.,26
21155,KRAMER,  Where are you going?,26
21156,KRAMER," Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.",26
21157,ELAINE, How ya feeling?,26
21158,GEORGE, Too much salt in my diet.,26
21159,ELAINE, Can I get you anything?,26
21160,GEORGE," Nah, I'm good.",26
21161,ELAINE, You sure? Anything?,26
21162,GEORGE," Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?",26
21163,ELAINE," No, it didn't. No, it didn't.",26
21164,GEORGE," It's like, all dented.",26
21165,ELAINE, Seems to be.,26
21166,GEORGE," Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--",26
21167,ELAINE," Shut up, George.",26
21168,GEORGE, Shut up?,26
21169,ELAINE, Yeah.,26
21170,GEORGE, Interesting.,26
21171,JERRY," Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!",26
21172,KRAMER," I don't have it, I threw it out.",26
21173,JERRY," You're lying! You got it, I want that number!",26
21174,KRAMER," I told you, I threw it out.",26
21175,JERRY, Give it to me!,26
21176,KRAMER," You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.",26
21177,JERRY," Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.",26
21178,KRAMER," You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.",26
21179,JERRY," I was lying, give it to me!",26
21180,KRAMER," No, you told me not to!",26
21181,JERRY, I want that number!,26
21182,KRAMER," Alright!  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!",26
21183,GEORGE, Yeah.,26
21184,GEORGE," Oh, I got it.",26
21185,GEORGE," Yeah, phew.",26
21186,GEORGE, What?,26
21187,GEORGE, We did?,26
21188,GEORGE, Hawaii?,26
21189,GEORGE,"  You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.",26
21190,GEORGE, Oh yeah. My friend lived there.,26
21191,GEORGE," You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.",26
21192,JERRY, I'm Nelson!,26
21193,JERRY," Alright, alright, I'm sorry.  Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.",26
21194,JERRY," Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.",26
21195,JERRY, (to himself,26
21196,ELAINE, You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.,26
21197,KRAMER,"  Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?",26
21198,ELAINE, Yeah.,26
21199,KRAMER, Wait wait wait wait wait.  Here.,26
21200,ELAINE, What do I need this for?,26
21201,KRAMER, Because we're engaged.,26
21202,ELAINE, We're engaged?,26
21203,KRAMER, Um hm.,26
21204,ELAINE," Kramer, this is too big.",26
21205,KRAMER,  It's my mom's.,26
21206,ELAINE," Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.",26
21207,KRAMER," Yes, yes I am.",26
21208,KRAMER," Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.",26
21209,KRAMER, My contention?,26
21210,KRAMER," Yes, that's my contention.",26
21211,ELAINE, I heard him contend that.,26
21212,ELAINE," Oh, it was a frame-up.",26
21213,ELAINE," Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.",26
21214,KRAMER, She does fine work.,26
21215,ELAINE, How kind of you.,26
21216,JERRY," Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.",26
21217,ELAINE, Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.,26
21218,ELAINE," My father, really? I had no idea.",26
21219,KRAMER, You don't say?,26
21220,ELAINE, I found it!,26
21221,KRAMER, So I grabbed the guy by the collar.,26
21222,ELAINE," Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!""",26
21223,JERRY, So I assume the jig was up.,26
21224,ELAINE," Yeah, pretty much.",26
21225,ELAINE, Hi!,26
21226,JERRY, Hey.,26
21227,GEORGE,"  Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!",26
21228,ELAINE," So, will I see you later tonight?",26
21229,KRAMER,"  Well, I'll check you guys out later.  Ready?",26
21230,KRAMER, Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.,26
21231,ELAINE,  Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--,26
21232,GEORGE,  Elaine. Shut up.,26
21233,JERRY,  How did you get fleas?,27
21234,GEORGE,  Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.,27
21235,JERRY,  Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.,27
21236,GEORGE,"  That's not funny.  So, are you coming to the party?",27
21237,JERRY,"  I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation.  The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, ""You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?""",27
21238,GEORGE,  You know Ava's gonna be there.,27
21239,JERRY,  Who?,27
21240,GEORGE,  The nice one that works in my office.,27
21241,JERRY,  Nah.,27
21242,GEORGE,  I'll drive.,27
21243,JERRY,"  Oh, well, now you're talking.",27
21244,GEORGE,  It's supposed to be a good party.,27
21245,JERRY,"  What does that mean, good dip?",27
21246,GEORGE,"  No, there'll be girls there.",27
21247,JERRY,"  There's girls everywhere.  I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator.  They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?",27
21248,GEORGE,  There's a hundred different things here.  What's the difference between these two?    You got propylparabin?,27
21249,JERRY,  Got it.,27
21250,GEORGE,  You got isobutane-30?,27
21251,JERRY,  I got isobutane-20.,27
21252,GEORGE,  A-ha.,27
21253,JERRY,  You got  sorbitant sesquioliate?,27
21254,GEORGE,  Got it.,27
21255,JERRY,  I have aloe!,27
21256,GEORGE,  You got aloe?  I love aloe.,27
21257,JERRY,  Where do they make yours?,27
21258,GEORGE,  Jersey.,27
21259,JERRY,  White Plains.,27
21260,JERRY,"  Girls.  There's girls right here in the store.  Look, look, there's one over there.  Look, there's another one.  Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there.  What's the matter?",27
21261,GEORGE,"  I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.",27
21262,JERRY,"  Are you sure?  Oh boy, here we go.",27
21263,GEORGE,"   Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.",27
21264,GEORGE,  I'm positive I gave you a twenty.,27
21265,GEORGE,  You owe me ten dollars.,27
21266,GEORGE,"  Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second.  Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake?  Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there?  Or you--",27
21267,GEORGE,"  No, no, no, see you're not really listening.",27
21268,GEORGE,"  No problem.  There's no problem.  She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.",27
21269,GEORGE,"  Oh, so you don't believe me either?",27
21270,GEORGE,"  You haven't won.  You may think you've won, but you haven't won.  Do you know why?  It's not over.  This is not over.  I'm not forgetting what's happening here.  You have my ten dollars.  I will get it back.  Alright, don't worry.  It's not over.  I'm going now.  Good bye.  I will be back.",27
21271,ELAINE,"  Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.",27
21272,JERRY,"  No, let's survey first.  Camp here.",27
21273,GEORGE, (waving,27
21274,JERRY,"  What could possess anyone to throw a party?  I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.",27
21275,GEORGE,"  Oh no you didn't.  Get out, when?",27
21276,GEORGE,  I don't believe it.,27
21277,GEORGE,"  Mark, is this true?",27
21278,JERRY,"  Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.",27
21279,ELAINE,"  How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.",27
21280,JERRY,"  Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight.  In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.",27
21281,ELAINE,  How old are you?,27
21282,JERRY,"  Thirty-six.  What's the signal?  Howbout this?  Chicken wing?  No, no, no, I got a better one.  Head patting.",27
21283,ELAINE,  Whatever you want.,27
21284,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah I did.",27
21285,JERRY, (Patting his head,27
21286,JERRY,   I hear a voice.,27
21287,JERRY,"  A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.",27
21288,JERRY,  It's a nervous tic.  I'm on L-Dopa.,27
21289,ELAINE,"  Yeah, me too.",27
21290,GEORGE,  How's it going?,27
21291,JERRY,"  Great, how about you?",27
21292,GEORGE,"  I can't believe what's happening here.  She hasn't taken her hands off me all night.  She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.",27
21293,JERRY,  How do you account for this?,27
21294,GEORGE,"  I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.",27
21295,JERRY,"  Well, she obviously liked you all along.",27
21296,GEORGE,"  No, I would have picked up on it.  I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know.  With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them.  If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, ""Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him.""",27
21297,JERRY,"  Anyway, I'm ready to go.",27
21298,GEORGE,  Now?,27
21299,JERRY,"  If not now, when?",27
21300,GEORGE,  Gimme a half-hour.,27
21301,JERRY,"  Okay, half-hour.",27
21302,JERRY,   Can I talk to you for a second?,27
21303,ELAINE,"  Oh, excuse me.    What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless.  People think I'm a mental patient.",27
21304,JERRY,"  Hey, I was dying over there.",27
21305,ELAINE,  This guy's going off on the peanut.  Now pay attention.,27
21306,JERRY,  Right.,27
21307,ELAINE,  Maybe the dingo ate your baby.,27
21308,ELAINE,  The dingo ate your baby!,27
21309,JERRY,  You ready?,27
21310,GEORGE,"  Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.",27
21311,JERRY,  I do favors.,27
21312,GEORGE,  I think something's happening here.,27
21313,JERRY,  What?,27
21314,GEORGE,  I think she wants me to take her home.,27
21315,JERRY,  Wow.,27
21316,GEORGE,  What should I do?,27
21317,JERRY,  Go!  What could you do?,27
21318,GEORGE,  What about you and Elaine?,27
21319,JERRY,  We'll get a ride.,27
21320,GEORGE,  Are you sure?,27
21321,JERRY,"  We'll be fine, what did she say?",27
21322,GEORGE,  She told me she wants--   She told me she wants me to make love to her.,27
21323,JERRY,  What?  She said that?,27
21324,GEORGE,  Yeah.,27
21325,JERRY,  Get out of here.,27
21326,GEORGE,  I swear.,27
21327,JERRY,  What did you say?,27
21328,GEORGE,"  I, I, I can't.",27
21329,JERRY,  What did you say?,27
21330,GEORGE,"  Please, it's--",27
21331,JERRY,  What?,27
21332,GEORGE,  I... I... I long for you.,27
21333,JERRY,  I long for you?,27
21334,GEORGE,  I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.,27
21335,JERRY,"  It's okay, that's not bad.",27
21336,GEORGE,"  I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.",27
21337,JERRY,  Really?,27
21338,GEORGE,"  That's a lot of pressure.  Make love to me.  What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?",27
21339,JERRY,"  Oh, come on.",27
21340,GEORGE,"  I can't perform under pressure.  That's why I never play anything for money, I choke.  I could choke tonight.  And she works in my office, can you imagine?  She goes around telling everyone what happened?  Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.",27
21341,JERRY,"  George, you're thinking too much.",27
21342,GEORGE,"  I know, I know, I can't stop it!",27
21343,ELAINE,"  Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.",27
21344,JERRY,   Pendant?  Those bastards.,27
21345,ELAINE,  Excuse me.,27
21346,JERRY,"  Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office",27
21347,ELAINE,  Really?  Huh.  What a world.  So we can go now?,27
21348,JERRY,"  Uh, no, he's taking the car.",27
21349,ELAINE,"  Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?",27
21350,JERRY,  I don't know.,27
21351,ELAINE,  You don't know?,27
21352,JERRY,  Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.,27
21353,ELAINE,"  Oh great, oh, this is great.  How could you let him take the car?",27
21354,JERRY,"  There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.",27
21355,ELAINE,   Oh look at that.  Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?,27
21356,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah, alright.",27
21357,ELAINE,  I can't believe she's walking around in that.,27
21358,JERRY,  Just don't make a scene.,27
21359,ELAINE,"  Hey, is that real fur?",27
21360,JERRY,  Oh boy.,27
21361,GEORGE,"  Yeah, good night.",27
21362,ELAINE,  You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?,27
21363,GEORGE,  Could we talk about this some other time?,27
21364,JERRY,  Here we go.,27
21365,ELAINE,"  Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.",27
21366,GEORGE,"  Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect.  Anyway-",27
21367,ELAINE,  Fish don't feel any pain.,27
21368,ELAINE,"  Well, they're not kept in little cages.",27
21369,GEORGE,  Goldfish.,27
21370,ELAINE,"  Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish.  They're not unhappy.",27
21371,ELAINE,"  Oh yeah, that's right.  Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!",27
21372,GEORGE,  That's why we're here in America.,27
21373,JERRY,  You're beautiful.,27
21374,ELAINE,  Call Kramer.,27
21375,JERRY,"  Alright.   Excuse me, this is your party, right?",27
21376,JERRY,  Can I use your phone?,27
21377,JERRY,  A bigger bill?,27
21378,JERRY,"  Krame?  Sein.  What are you doing?  Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island.  What are your thoughts about taking a ride?  You sure?  Okay, but don't leave me hanging here.  Okay, great.  Let me give you directions.",27
21379,ELAINE,  You sure you don't need any help?,27
21380,JERRY,  I'm sure he'll be here any minute.,27
21381,ELAINE,  Call him again.,27
21382,JERRY,"  I called, what should I do?  We really appreciate this.",27
21383,JERRY,"   Oh, you got the Civil War book.  I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.",27
21384,ELAINE,  Six hundred and twenty million people died.,27
21385,JERRY,  Thousand.,27
21386,ELAINE,"  Thousand.  Six hundred and twenty thousand.  The horror, the horror.   The wife keeps giving us dirty looks.  Are you sure you gave him the right directions?",27
21387,JERRY,  Yes.    You're sure there's nothing we can do?,27
21388,JERRY,  You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here.  Mike Wichter.  He sold plastic straws.  You know the ones?  You could bend them.,27
21389,ELAINE,"  Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.",27
21390,JERRY,"  Oh, he's coming.",27
21391,JERRY,  That's him.,27
21392,ELAINE,  Thanks a lot.,27
21393,JERRY,"  Thanks, great party.",27
21394,KRAMER,"  Hey, how ya doing?",27
21395,KRAMER,  I'm sorry.,27
21396,JERRY,"  Hey, it's okay.",27
21397,KRAMER,"  I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.",27
21398,ELAINE,  Then how did you find the place?,27
21399,KRAMER,"  Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive.  Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it.  8173.",27
21400,JERRY,"  Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.",27
21401,JERRY,"  And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.",27
21402,JERRY,"   Here's my address and number.  And really, thanks again.",27
21403,KRAMER,   You better zip up.  I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.,27
21404,ELAINE,  But it's cold out.,27
21405,KRAMER,"  Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.",27
21406,JERRY,"  George, I've been sick all week.  Elaine was too.  Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes.  Do the math.  Yeah, maybe I will get out.  Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first.  Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something.  Yeah, Selwyn's.  Okay bye.",27
21407,JERRY,  Who is it?,27
21408,JERRY,  Who?,27
21409,JERRY,  Do I know you?,27
21410,JERRY,"  I'm sorry, uh-",27
21411,JERRY,"  Oh, okay.",27
21412,JERRY,  You certainly are.  What's going on?,27
21413,JERRY,"  Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.",27
21414,JERRY,"  No, really, I just got off the phone with him.",27
21415,JERRY,"  Look, you can hang out here if you want.",27
21416,JERRY,"  No, it's-",27
21417,JERRY,"  No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.",27
21418,JERRY,"  Really, I'm sorry.  Maybe another time.",27
21419,JERRY,"  They guy's in my house right now.  What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.",27
21420,GEORGE,"  Yeah, me either.",27
21421,JERRY,"  Oh, come on.",27
21422,GEORGE,  What come on?  Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?,27
21423,JERRY,  I've never had a job.,27
21424,GEORGE,"  You know the anxiety you feel on a date?  That's what I have every day now.  My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.",27
21425,JERRY,"  That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?",27
21426,GEORGE,"  Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend.  Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk.  I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing.  Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went.  If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day.  I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me.  I want to go back there again.'",27
21427,JERRY,  What are you gonna do?,27
21428,GEORGE,"  I have no choice, I'm quitting.",27
21429,KRAMER,"  The party, Long Island?",27
21430,KRAMER,"  Hey, what are you doing here?",27
21431,KRAMER,  Where's Jerry?,27
21432,KRAMER,"  Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything.    Well, but I might have something.",27
21433,JERRY,"  Alright, I'm gonna get this.  This looks good.",27
21434,GEORGE,  How much is that?,27
21435,JERRY,  Nine sixty.,27
21436,GEORGE,  Nine sixty?  Give it to me.,27
21437,JERRY,  Why?,27
21438,GEORGE,"  Don't worry, I got it.",27
21439,JERRY,"  What do you mean, you got it?",27
21440,GEORGE,  I got it.,27
21441,JERRY,"  Since when are you treating me to medicine?  What are you doing?  You're stealing this, aren't you?",27
21442,GEORGE,  I'm not stealing it.  They owe me ten dollars.  They stole from me.,27
21443,JERRY,  You're a lunatic.,27
21444,GEORGE,"  I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.",27
21445,JERRY,  What do you say to a person like you?,27
21446,GEORGE,  Just walk.,27
21447,JERRY,  Oh.,27
21448,GEORGE,  What?,27
21449,GEORGE,"  Oh, I was gonna pay for this.",27
21450,GEORGE,   Where are you taking me?  I was gonna pay for it.,27
21451,GEORGE,   What are you talking about?,27
21452,GEORGE,   What are you gonna do?  Are you gonna call the police?,27
21453,JERRY,  Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?,27
21454,KRAMER,"  So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown!  Well I followed the instructions!",27
21455,KRAMER,  Not really.,27
21456,KRAMER,   555-LOVE.,27
21457,KRAMER,"  No, I got a girl in the next building",27
21458,JERRY,  What the hell?,27
21459,JERRY,  Nice to meet you.,27
21460,JERRY,  What the hell is going on here?,27
21461,JERRY,"  Oh, Kramer huh?",27
21462,JERRY,  Patti?,27
21463,JERRY,"  Alright, how much does he owe you?",27
21464,JERRY,   Fifty dollars.,27
21465,JERRY,"  Yeah, but--",27
21466,JERRY,"  Wait a second, I--",27
21467,ELAINE,  I brought you chicken soup.    Is that real fur?,27
21468,GEORGE,  You had Sgt. Chadway?  Me too.,27
21469,JERRY,  He was a nice guy.,27
21470,GEORGE,"  Oh, great guy.",27
21471,JERRY,  Was there a red-headed guy there?,27
21472,GEORGE,  The one with the long sideburns?,27
21473,JERRY,  Yeah.,27
21474,GEORGE,  Where does he come off?,27
21475,JERRY,"  Yeah, I know.  There's no call for that kind of attitude.",27
21476,GEORGE,  One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.,27
21477,JERRY,"  Oh, we all hated him.",27
21478,JERRY, Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.,28
21479,GEORGE, Was the alarm on?,28
21480,JERRY," I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.",28
21481,GEORGE," I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?",28
21482,JERRY, They cross the wires or something.,28
21483,GEORGE, Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.,28
21484,JERRY, They stole my car.,28
21485,KRAMER, Who did?,28
21486,JERRY, They did.,28
21487,KRAMER, Was it more than just one?,28
21488,JERRY," What should I do, should I call the police?",28
21489,KRAMER, What are they gonna do?,28
21490,JERRY," I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.",28
21491,GEORGE, Maybe you should call your car phone.,28
21492,JERRY," Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.",28
21493,GEORGE," Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.",28
21494,JERRY, Are you serious?,28
21495,GEORGE," Yeah, go ahead, call.",28
21496,JERRY, I don't even know if I remember the number.,28
21497,JERRY, What do I say if he picks up?,28
21498,JERRY, Hello? Is this 555-8383?,28
21499,JERRY, Can I ask you a question?,28
21500,JERRY, Did you steal my car?,28
21501,JERRY, You did?!,28
21502,JERRY, That's my car!,28
21503,JERRY, What are you gonna do with it?,28
21504,JERRY, Then can I have it back?,28
21505,KRAMER, Hello?,28
21506,KRAMER, Kramer.,28
21507,KRAMER," Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.",28
21508,KRAMER," Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.",28
21509,KRAMER," Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.",28
21510,JERRY,  Gloves.  Hello?,28
21511,JERRY," Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?",28
21512,JERRY," Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.",28
21513,JERRY, Sid left the keys in the car.,28
21514,GEORGE, Who's Sid?,28
21515,JERRY," He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.",28
21516,GEORGE, What do you mean?,28
21517,JERRY, He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.,28
21518,GEORGE," What, do you pay him for that?",28
21519,JERRY," Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.",28
21520,GEORGE, How many people does he do that for?,28
21521,JERRY," The whole block, forty, fifty cars.",28
21522,KRAMER," He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?",28
21523,GEORGE, Could anybody do that?,28
21524,JERRY," Hey Sid, what happened?",28
21525,JERRY, You left the keys in the car?,28
21526,KRAMER, You know I'm in that movie?,28
21527,GEORGE, You are?,28
21528,KRAMER," Yeah, I'm an extra.",28
21529,GEORGE, How'd you get that?,28
21530,KRAMER," Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.",28
21531,GEORGE, Right out of the clear blue sky?,28
21532,KRAMER, Clear blue sky!,28
21533,GEORGE," Well, why didn't they ask me?",28
21534,KRAMER, I got a quality.,28
21535,JERRY," Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.",28
21536,JERRY, This Wednesday?,28
21537,JERRY, But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.,28
21538,GEORGE," Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?",28
21539,GEORGE, Maybe I could move them until you get back.,28
21540,GEORGE, I'm in a transition phase right now.,28
21541,JERRY," Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.",28
21542,ELAINE," I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.",28
21543,JERRY," Owen March, I never heard of him.",28
21544,ELAINE," Well, he's not a baseball player.",28
21545,JERRY," Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.",28
21546,ELAINE," Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.",28
21547,JERRY, What's that?,28
21548,ELAINE, He's sixty-six years old.,28
21549,ELAINE," Well, go, go.",28
21550,JERRY," Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.",28
21551,JERRY, Sixty-six years old?,28
21552,ELAINE," Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.",28
21553,JERRY," Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?",28
21554,ELAINE," What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?",28
21555,JERRY," Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.",28
21556,JERRY," I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?",28
21557,JERRY, But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.,28
21558,JERRY," I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.",28
21559,JERRY," Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?",28
21560,ELAINE, What?,28
21561,JERRY," Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.",28
21562,ELAINE," Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?",28
21563,JERRY, Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.,28
21564,ELAINE," Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.",28
21565,JERRY," Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.",28
21566,JERRY, Fine.,28
21567,JERRY," Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.",28
21568,ELAINE," What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?",28
21569,JERRY," Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.",28
21570,ELAINE," I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.",28
21571,ELAINE, I just don't enjoy being with him.,28
21572,JERRY, Well that's what's important.,28
21573,ELAINE," I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?",28
21574,JERRY, How many times you been out with him?,28
21575,ELAINE, Seven?,28
21576,JERRY, Face to face.,28
21577,ELAINE, Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?,28
21578,JERRY," If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.",28
21579,ELAINE, Hmm... How's the pasta over there?,28
21580,KRAMER," Whoa, whoa!!",28
21581,JERRY, What is going on out there?,28
21582,GEORGE," I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!",28
21583,KRAMER," Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?",28
21584,ELAINE, Today?!,28
21585,KRAMER, You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.,28
21586,ELAINE, Yeah.,28
21587,KRAMER," So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.",28
21588,ELAINE, He was laughing?!,28
21589,KRAMER," Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.",28
21590,JERRY, So then what?,28
21591,KRAMER, I got a line in the movie!,28
21592,ELAINE, Get out!,28
21593,JERRY, That's great!,28
21594,GEORGE, You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?,28
21595,KRAMER," Pretty good, huh?",28
21596,GEORGE, You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?,28
21597,KRAMER," Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?",28
21598,JERRY, You mean *a* career.,28
21599,ELAINE, So was Mia Farrow there?,28
21600,KRAMER," Uh, I didn't see him.",28
21601,ELAINE, What's your line?,28
21602,KRAMER," Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?",28
21603,KRAMER," So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, ""Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.""",28
21604,GEORGE, Is that how you're gonna say it?,28
21605,KRAMER," No, no, I'm working on it.",28
21606,ELAINE," Do it like this. ""These pretzels are making me thirsty.""",28
21607,JERRY," No. ""These pretzels are making me thirsty.""",28
21608,KRAMER," No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.",28
21609,GEORGE," ""These pretzels are making me thirsty!!""",28
21610,GEORGE, That was no good?,28
21611,KRAMER, I didn't say anything.,28
21612,ELAINE, I'm gonna go break up with Owen.,28
21613,GEORGE, What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living!  Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!,28
21614,JERRY, Oh my god.,28
21615,ELAINE, Call an ambulance.,28
21616,JERRY," Boy, he took it hard.",28
21617,ELAINE, We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.,28
21618,JERRY,"  Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.",28
21619,ELAINE, Tell then to hurry! Hurry!,28
21620,JERRY,  It's an ambulance.  I don't know but he's unconscious.,28
21621,KRAMER," These pretzels are making me thirsty.  Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.",28
21622,JERRY, Kramer.,28
21623,KRAMER, What happened here?,28
21624,ELAINE," I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?",28
21625,JERRY, Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?,28
21626,ELAINE, What extremities?,28
21627,KRAMER, What's an extremity?,28
21628,JERRY," You raise the feet, get blood to the head.",28
21629,KRAMER," You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.",28
21630,ELAINE," Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.",28
21631,JERRY, I don't have a washcloth.,28
21632,ELAINE, Well use a paper towel.,28
21633,JERRY, You can't put a paper towel on his head.,28
21634,KRAMER, What about a big sponge?,28
21635,JERRY, How you gonna hold it on there?,28
21636,KRAMER, Use a belt.,28
21637,ELAINE," No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.",28
21638,JERRY, Should we walk him around?,28
21639,KRAMER," Yeah, I've seen them do that.",28
21640,JERRY," No, no that's for a drug overdose.",28
21641,KRAMER, Maybe that's what he's got.,28
21642,ELAINE," No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.",28
21643,KRAMER, Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.,28
21644,ELAINE, He is not a drug addict!,28
21645,JERRY," Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.",28
21646,ELAINE, A cookie!,28
21647,KRAMER, Can you give him a cookie?,28
21648,ELAINE, How's he gonna chew it?,28
21649,JERRY," We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.",28
21650,ELAINE," Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.",28
21651,KRAMER, I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.,28
21652,ELAINE," You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.",28
21653,JERRY, Cookies don't liquefy.,28
21654,ELAINE," Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.",28
21655,KRAMER, Alright I'll get a blender.,28
21656,JERRY, What blender? I don't have a blender.,28
21657,KRAMER, You got a blender.,28
21658,JERRY, I would know if I had a blender.,28
21659,ELAINE, Where is the ambulance?!,28
21660,JERRY,"  Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.",28
21661,ELAINE, I can't believe what's going on out here.,28
21662,JERRY," This is an emergency, what's taking so long?  Wait a second, maybe that's them.  Hello?",28
21663,JERRY," Come on up. Okay, they're here.",28
21664,ELAINE, He seems to be breathing.,28
21665,JERRY," Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.",28
21666,ELAINE, I know.,28
21667,JERRY," Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?",28
21668,ELAINE, Almost.,28
21669,JERRY," Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.",28
21670,ELAINE, It's not an easy thing to bring up.,28
21671,JERRY," Yeah, that's true.",28
21672,ELAINE," Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.",28
21673,JERRY, Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.,28
21674,ELAINE," He does, how'd you know that?",28
21675,JERRY, I could tell.,28
21676,ELAINE," What happened, what took you so long?!",28
21677,JERRY, Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!,28
21678,GEORGE, Oh man.,28
21679,JERRY, What happened to the car?,28
21680,GEORGE," Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there!  Who's he?",28
21681,ELAINE, This guy I'm seeing.,28
21682,GEORGE, What happened?,28
21683,JERRY, We don't know!,28
21684,JERRY, So how'd you hit the car?,28
21685,GEORGE," I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.",28
21686,JERRY," It's not even my car, it's a rental.",28
21687,KRAMER," What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.",28
21688,GEORGE, Woody mentioned me? What did he say?,28
21689,KRAMER," He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'",28
21690,GEORGE, Should I apologize to Woody?,28
21691,KRAMER," Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.",28
21692,GEORGE, Well I know how to drive.,28
21693,JERRY, Can I get anybody anything?,28
21694,GEORGE," I put my pants on, Sid.",28
21695,GEORGE, Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.,28
21696,GEORGE, Maybe I could call my father.,28
21697,KRAMER," Hey, you seen the paper yet?",28
21698,JERRY," Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.",28
21699,KRAMER, Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.,28
21700,JERRY,"  Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.",28
21701,KRAMER," Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.",28
21702,JERRY,  The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.,28
21703,JERRY,  The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.,28
21704,ELAINE," Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'",28
21705,JERRY, Can he communicate?,28
21706,ELAINE," Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.",28
21707,JERRY," Alright, she's free.  Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.",28
21708,ELAINE," So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.",28
21709,JERRY, What community? There's a community?,28
21710,ELAINE, Of course there's a community.,28
21711,JERRY," All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.",28
21712,JERRY," Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...",28
21713,JERRY," That is right, somebody else was driving.",28
21714,JERRY," Uh huh, what's that?",28
21715,JERRY, Other drivers?,28
21716,JERRY," Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?",28
21717,JERRY," Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.",28
21718,JERRY," Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?",28
21719,JERRY, These pretzels are making me thirsty.,28
21720,ELAINE," Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh?  Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean.  Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.",28
21721,ELAINE," Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?",28
21722,JERRY, An overdose of odor? Good question.,28
21723,GEORGE, Do I smell?,28
21724,ELAINE," No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.",28
21725,JERRY, Ahh.,28
21726,GEORGE, He's alright?,28
21727,ELAINE," Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.",28
21728,JERRY, Let me get that.,28
21729,GEORGE," No no no, I got it.",28
21730,JERRY, Please.,28
21731,GEORGE," No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,",28
21732,JERRY,"  Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.",28
21733,JERRY, What are you doing here?,28
21734,KRAMER, I got fired from the movie.,28
21735,GEORGE," Get out of here, why?",28
21736,KRAMER," Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.",28
21737,ELAINE, Aww.,28
21738,KRAMER," Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.",28
21739,JERRY," Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.",28
21740,JERRY," I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going ""I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?",29
21741,JERRY," Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.",29
21742,GEORGE, Like you do.,29
21743,JERRY, Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?,29
21744,GEORGE, What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?,29
21745,JERRY, I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?,29
21746,GEORGE, Why did France give that to us anyway?,29
21747,JERRY, It was a gift.,29
21748,GEORGE, So countries just exchange gifts like that?,29
21749,JERRY, If they like each other.,29
21750,GEORGE, There's Elaine.,29
21751,JERRY, See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.,29
21752,GEORGE, Really? They work here in the office?,29
21753,JERRY, Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.,29
21754,GEORGE, Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.,29
21755,JERRY, You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.,29
21756,GEORGE, Really?,29
21757,JERRY, Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.,29
21758,GEORGE," ""Off the wagon""?",29
21759,JERRY, I think it's off the wagon.,29
21760,GEORGE," I think it's ""on the wagon"".",29
21761,ELAINE," Jerry, George, what are you doing here?",29
21762,JERRY, What am I doing here? Ba-boom ,29
21763,ELAINE, *gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! ,29
21764,JERRY, Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.,29
21765,ELAINE, Where did you find it?,29
21766,JERRY, Under the sofa cushion.,29
21767,ELAINE, And you stopped by just to give it to me?,29
21768,JERRY, It's your Christmas present.,29
21769,ELAINE, I though I'd never find it.,29
21770,GEORGE, Well today's your lucky day.,29
21771,ELAINE, No. Today's *your* lucky day.,29
21772,GEORGE, It will be my first one.,29
21773,ELAINE, You want to work here?,29
21774,GEORGE, Huh?,29
21775,ELAINE," Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.",29
21776,JERRY," ""The guy?""",29
21777,ELAINE,  Dick.,29
21778,GEORGE, How can you just get it?,29
21779,ELAINE," My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.",29
21780,JERRY, Cranberry juice?,29
21781,ELAINE, And vodka.,29
21782,JERRY, So... I'm Jerry. ,29
21783,GEORGE," Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.",29
21784,GEORGE, I like Mike Lubika.,29
21785,GEORGE, He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...,29
21786,GEORGE, Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.,29
21787,GEORGE," Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.",29
21788,GEORGE," He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.",29
21789,GEORGE, Venetian Blinds.,29
21790,JERRY, Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.,29
21791,ELAINE, Where's my drink?,29
21792,JERRY," There.  So, how did it go?",29
21793,GEORGE, I think he was impressed.,29
21794,ELAINE," No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.",29
21795,JERRY," Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.",29
21796,ELAINE, Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.,29
21797,JERRY," I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.",29
21798,ELAINE, One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.,29
21799,GEORGE, Told you.,29
21800,JERRY, I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.,29
21801,GEORGE, Do I really have to buy her something?,29
21802,JERRY, Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?,29
21803,GEORGE, What is that? Is that cashmere?,29
21804,JERRY, Yeah. She would love cashmere.,29
21805,GEORGE, Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.,29
21806,JERRY, Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.,29
21807,GEORGE," Wow. Excuse me, Miss?",29
21808,GEORGE, How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?,29
21809,GEORGE, What? I don't see anything.,29
21810,GEORGE, Oh yeah.,29
21811,JERRY, Oh it's damaged. ,29
21812,GEORGE,  Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?,29
21813,GEORGE, You think she would care about the red dot?,29
21814,JERRY, It's hard to say.,29
21815,GEORGE, I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?,29
21816,JERRY, Well I can see it.,29
21817,GEORGE," Yeah, but you know where it is.",29
21818,JERRY, Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?,29
21819,GEORGE, Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?,29
21820,JERRY, It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.,29
21821,GEORGE, Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?,29
21822,JERRY, You want me to take an overview?,29
21823,GEORGE, Please.,29
21824,JERRY, I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.,29
21825,JERRY, Yeah so?,29
21826,ELAINE, He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.,29
21827,JERRY," Oh boy, can you smell it?",29
21828,ELAINE, No. I can't smell it.,29
21829,JERRY, Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.,29
21830,ELAINE, You don't always smell someone from a drink.,29
21831,JERRY, Yes you do.,29
21832,ELAINE, What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?,29
21833,JERRY, Yes you would.,29
21834,JERRY, I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?,29
21835,KRAMER, Okay.,29
21836,JERRY, Would you take a drink and let us smell you?,29
21837,KRAMER, You can smell me without the drink.,29
21838,ELAINE, I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.,29
21839,KRAMER," Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?",29
21840,JERRY, I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.,29
21841,KRAMER, All right.,29
21842,JERRY, I don't smell anything.,29
21843,ELAINE, Maybe we're too close to the bottle.,29
21844,JERRY, Yeah.,29
21845,GEORGE,  It's George.,29
21846,JERRY, Come on up.,29
21847,KRAMER," That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.",29
21848,GEORGE, Hello everybody.,29
21849,KRAMER," Hey.  I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.",29
21850,GEORGE,  Thank you.,29
21851,ELAINE, Hey what's that?,29
21852,GEORGE, It's an early Christmas present.,29
21853,ELAINE, Christmas present? For who?,29
21854,GEORGE, For you.,29
21855,ELAINE, *gasp*  Get out of here.,29
21856,KRAMER," Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret.  h-e-double n...",29
21857,JERRY, Kramer. Yeah that'll do.,29
21858,ELAINE,"  Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?",29
21859,GEORGE, Of course it's cashmere.,29
21860,ELAINE," Oh, I love cashmere.",29
21861,GEORGE, Well who doesn't.,29
21862,ELAINE," My, George this must have cost a fortune.",29
21863,GEORGE," Ahh, money.",29
21864,ELAINE," Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?",29
21865,JERRY, I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.,29
21866,ELAINE," George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.",29
21867,GEORGE," Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.",29
21868,KRAMER, What's that red dot on your sweater?,29
21869,ELAINE, What?,29
21870,GEORGE, Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.,29
21871,ELAINE, Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.,29
21872,GEORGE, What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?,29
21873,JERRY,"  Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.",29
21874,ELAINE, What don't you know?,29
21875,JERRY, I don't know.,29
21876,ELAINE, Well do you see it or don't you?,29
21877,JERRY, Ahem. Say that again?,29
21878,ELAINE, Do you see it or don't you?,29
21879,JERRY, Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.,29
21880,JERRY, Now what did you ask me again.,29
21881,ELAINE, You're still here. You're a dynamo.,29
21882,GEORGE, I can't believe I get paid for this.,29
21883,ELAINE, I'll see you tomorrow.,29
21884,GEORGE, How you doing?,29
21885,JERRY," You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?",29
21886,GEORGE," Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.",29
21887,JERRY," Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.",29
21888,GEORGE, Why is that?,29
21889,JERRY, It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.,29
21890,GEORGE," So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... ",29
21891,JERRY, Convulsing?,29
21892,GEORGE, Convulsing?,29
21893,JERRY," I don't know, I'm trying to help you.",29
21894,GEORGE, Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.,29
21895,JERRY, You don't drink.,29
21896,GEORGE, I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.,29
21897,JERRY, So you started drinking.,29
21898,GEORGE," So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.",29
21899,JERRY, So how was it?,29
21900,GEORGE," Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.",29
21901,JERRY, Good thing the cleaning lady was there.,29
21902,ELAINE, Dick was fired.,29
21903,JERRY," You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.",29
21904,ELAINE, You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?,29
21905,JERRY, What are you saying?,29
21906,ELAINE, I'm not saying anything.,29
21907,JERRY, You're saying something.,29
21908,ELAINE, What could I be saying?,29
21909,JERRY, Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.,29
21910,ELAINE, If I was saying something I would have said it.,29
21911,JERRY, Well why don't you say it?,29
21912,ELAINE, I said it.,29
21913,JERRY, What did you say?,29
21914,ELAINE, Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.,29
21915,JERRY, Yeah?,29
21916,GEORGE,  It's George.,29
21917,JERRY, Come on up.,29
21918,ELAINE," Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper?  Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.",29
21919,JERRY, No I didn't.,29
21920,ELAINE," Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.",29
21921,JERRY, I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.,29
21922,ELAINE, How much did he save?,29
21923,JERRY," Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question  of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.",29
21924,GEORGE," I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.",29
21925,JERRY, Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.,29
21926,GEORGE, Did you tell her anything?,29
21927,JERRY, No.,29
21928,GEORGE, Do you swear?,29
21929,JERRY, I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.,29
21930,GEORGE, Oh you told her didn't you.,29
21931,JERRY, No.,29
21932,ELAINE," Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?",29
21933,GEORGE, What? Did I what?,29
21934,ELAINE, You did didn't you.,29
21935,GEORGE," Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season  and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.",29
21936,ELAINE, Well Jerry told me that you did.,29
21937,GEORGE, You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.,29
21938,JERRY, I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.,29
21939,GEORGE," Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time.  I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.",29
21940,GEORGE, This is for you.,29
21941,GEORGE," As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.",29
21942,GEORGE, Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.,29
21943,GEORGE, Of course it's cashemere.,29
21944,GEORGE, Just a little something for Christmas.,29
21945,GEORGE," I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.",29
21946,GEORGE, Take it off. You're going to ruin it.,29
21947,JERRY," I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.",29
21948,JERRY," Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.",29
21949,JERRY, In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?,29
21950,JERRY, On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?,29
21951,JERRY, They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?,29
21952,JERRY, I know enough not to get on them.,29
21953,GEORGE, Who said that?,29
21954,GEORGE," Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.",29
21955,GEORGE, Well you didn't have to say it like that.,29
21956,GEORGE, What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?,29
21957,ELAINE, You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.,29
21958,GEORGE, You never had sex in the office before?,29
21959,ELAINE, No. I once made out with someone but that was it.,29
21960,GEORGE, Alright so you made out with someone.,29
21961,ELAINE, Well that's not sex.,29
21962,GEORGE, Kissing is sex.,29
21963,ELAINE, Kissing is not sex.,29
21964,JERRY, George?,29
21965,GEORGE, Jerry.,29
21966,ELAINE," Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?",29
21967,GEORGE, No.,29
21968,JERRY, George?,29
21969,GEORGE, Over here.,29
21970,ELAINE, What are you doing here?,29
21971,JERRY, I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.,29
21972,ELAINE, Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?,29
21973,JERRY, I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.,29
21974,ELAINE," So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.",29
21975,JERRY, Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.,29
21976,ELAINE, Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.,29
21977,GEORGE," Hide, hide under the desk.",29
21978,ELAINE," Ow, ow move over.",29
21979,JERRY, Get off of me.,29
21980,ELAINE, I've got no room.,29
21981,GEORGE, Of course it's cashmere.,29
21982,JERRY," But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.",29
21983,JERRY, Don't get smart.,29
21984,KRAMER," All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.",30
21985,ELAINE, Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?,30
21986,KRAMER," Well, yeah...",30
21987,ELAINE," Ok, what time is your job interview George?",30
21988,GEORGE, 9,30
21989,JERRY," Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.",30
21990,GEORGE, Why not?,30
21991,JERRY," That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.",30
21992,GEORGE," What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.",30
21993,ELAINE," All right, I'm gonna go.",30
21994,JERRY, What time is the lesbian wedding?,30
21995,ELAINE, 9,30
21996,GEORGE," Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?",30
21997,ELAINE," Yeah, they flip a coin.",30
21998,GEORGE," What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.",30
21999,JERRY, I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train ,30
22000,GEORGE," I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking",30
22001,KRAMER," Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.",30
22002,JERRY," Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?",30
22003,KRAMER, Yeah.,30
22004,ELAINE, Yeah.,30
22005,GEORGE, Yeah.,30
22006,JERRY, Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.,30
22007,GEORGE, How many tickets are you paying today?,30
22008,KRAMER," Well, let's see",30
22009,GEORGE, No doors?,30
22010,KRAMER," I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.",30
22011,GEORGE," I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.",30
22012,GEORGE, That guy is not blind.,30
22013,JERRY," So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?",30
22014,GEORGE, I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.,30
22015,JERRY, Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.,30
22016,GEORGE, That's amazing.,30
22017,JERRY, So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.,30
22018,GEORGE, What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.,30
22019,JERRY," All right, biff. Elaine, merry-go-round?",30
22020,ELAINE, I can't. I'm the best man.,30
22021,JERRY," Kramer, bumper-cars?",30
22022,KRAMER," I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?",30
22023,JERRY, Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.,30
22024,ELAINE, See'ya.,30
22025,GEORGE," Me, why?",30
22026,GEORGE," Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.",30
22027,GEORGE," Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.",30
22028,GEORGE," Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'.",30
22029,GEORGE," Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.",30
22030,GEORGE, They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.,30
22031,GEORGE," Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.",30
22032,ELAINE, It's ironic.,30
22033,ELAINE," This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.",30
22034,ELAINE, Oh...,30
22035,ELAINE, A wedding.,30
22036,ELAINE, Yeah,30
22037,ELAINE, You're telling me.,30
22038,ELAINE," Oh, very nice.",30
22039,ELAINE, She.,30
22040,ELAINE, There is no he.,30

22049,JERRY," O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?",30
22050,JERRY, You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.,30
22051,JERRY," I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?",30
22052,JERRY," All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.",30
22053,JERRY," I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.",30
22054,JERRY," That's your problem, you should be.",30
22055,JERRY," Don't get up, please, allow me.",30

22069,GEORGE," Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.",30
22070,GEORGE," You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.",30
22071,GEORGE," Like a ""Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame""",30

22077,GEORGE," No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?",30
22078,KRAMER," Yes! Yes! I won, hey ",30
22079,JERRY, First we ride the cyclone.,30
22080,JERRY," Aah, French fries.",30
22081,JERRY," No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.",30
22082,ELAINE, Too bad.,30
22083,JERRY, You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!,30
22084,JERRY, You want him?,30
22085,ELAINE, Get that out of my face.,30
22086,JERRY," So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!",30
22087,GEORGE," How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?",30
22088,ELAINE, George?,30
22089,JERRY," Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?",30

22096,ELAINE," Here, pay. ",30
22097,KRAMER," Wait, wait, wait...",30
22098,GEORGE, ...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!,31
22099,GEORGE," We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?",31
22100,JERRY, Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.,31
22101,GEORGE, I was telling you about Noel.,31
22102,JERRY," Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...",31
22103,GEORGE, [sarcastically] Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...,31
22104,JERRY," All right, I'm sorry. What about her?",31
22105,GEORGE," What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?",31
22106,JERRY," I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.",31
22107,GEORGE," No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...",31
22108,GEORGE, How do I get the hand?,31
22109,JERRY, We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.,31
22110,GEORGE," She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...",31
22111,JERRY," Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...",31
22112,GEORGE," Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.",31
22113,KRAMER," Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!",31
22114,GEORGE," With all due respect, I don't think so...",31
22115,JERRY," That smells good, what is that?",31
22116,KRAMER, The *beach*!,31
22117,JERRY, The *beach*?,31
22118,GEORGE," What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!",31
22119,KRAMER, I just joined the Polar Bear Club.,31
22120,JERRY, You joined the *Polar Bears*?!,31
22121,GEORGE," What the Hell is a ""Polar Bear""?",31
22122,KRAMER," Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....",31
22123,JERRY, Yeah... So's shock therapy.,31
22124,JERRY," [with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!",31
22125,KRAMER," Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.",31
22126,GEORGE," Hey, what goes on there, exactly?",31
22127,JERRY, You don't know?,31
22128,GEORGE," No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...",31
22129,JERRY," You think they have fleas there, don't you?",31
22130,GEORGE, *No*...,31
22131,JERRY," Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.",31
22132,GEORGE," All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...",31
22133,ELAINE, I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?,31
22134,JERRY, They have a piano backstage they warm up on.,31
22135,ELAINE," *No*, we would have heard it.",31
22136,JERRY," What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?",31
22137,GEORGE," I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.",31
22138,JERRY," [quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!",31
22139,JERRY, Is this okay? Can I do this? ,31
22140,ELAINE," Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi...",31
22141,ELAINE," Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.",31
22142,ELAINE, We did. We're just hanging out.,31
22143,ELAINE," Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?",31
22144,ELAINE, Have you thought about an intervention?,31
22145,ELAINE," You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.",31
22146,GEORGE, What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?,31
22147,JERRY," I dunno, it was an impulse.",31
22148,GEORGE, What kind of a sick impulse does that??,31
22149,JERRY, How could I know she would start to laugh?,31
22150,ELAINE, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!,31
22151,JERRY, Can we just go in already?,31
22152,GEORGE, What are we gonna tell her?,31
22153,ELAINE, I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.,31
22154,GEORGE," No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...",31
22155,ELAINE," [To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.",31
22156,JERRY, What about?,31
22157,GEORGE," Hey, hey! We're discussing something!",31
22158,JERRY," I know, but I'm distracted now.",31
22159,GEORGE, What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.,31
22160,ELAINE, When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.,31
22161,JERRY," Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?",31
22162,ELAINE, He's good.,31
22163,GEORGE," Uh, can we cut to the chase?",31
22164,JERRY," ""Cut to the chase""?",31
22165,GEORGE, Yeah...,31
22166,JERRY," What're you, ""Joe Hollywood""?",31
22167,GEORGE, A lot of people say it.,31
22168,JERRY, I would lose that.,31
22169,GEORGE, [Accusingly] What's *that*?,31
22170,JERRY," ""Lose that""? That's not a Hollywood expression!",31
22171,GEORGE, [Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.,31
22172,ELAINE, Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.,31
22173,JERRY," Really, an intervention ...",31
22174,GEORGE," Y'know people, we got a situation over here!",31
22175,ELAINE," Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.",31
22176,JERRY, Me? Why me?,31
22177,ELAINE, 'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.,31
22178,JERRY, Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...,31
22179,GEORGE," All right, OK, I'm goin' in.",31
22180,JERRY, We've got to talk about this ,31
22181,ELAINE, All right.,31
22182,GEORGE," Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.",31
22183,GEORGE," Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel",31
22184,JERRY, You play a *Hell* of a piano.,31
22185,ELAINE," Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved.",31
22186,ELAINE," Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.",31
22187,JERRY, Pez?,31
22188,GEORGE," Me, uh, uh, no, ...",31
22189,JERRY, Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.,31
22190,ELAINE, Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.,31
22191,JERRY, Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.,31
22192,ELAINE, I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.,31
22193,GEORGE, If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful ,31
22194,GEORGE," All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.",31
22195,JERRY, We'll be outside,31
22196,ELAINE, Yeah,31
22197,JERRY," It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?",31
22198,GEORGE, We'll have a good time,31
22199,GEORGE," Ah, come on",31
22200,GEORGE," Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqué. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]",31
22201,JERRY, You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.,31
22202,ELAINE, What? How?,31
22203,JERRY, A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.,31
22204,ELAINE, So? What happened?,31
22205,JERRY," What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.",31
22206,ELAINE, Shut up!,31
22207,JERRY, All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.,31
22208,ELAINE, Whar about Kramer?,31
22209,JERRY, He's the same!,31
22210,JERRY," Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?",31
22211,KRAMER,"  Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?",31
22212,JERRY," Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.",31
22213,KRAMER, Can I get in on that?,31
22214,JERRY, What do you think? It's like a poker game?,31
22215,KRAMER, Is Elaine going?,31
22216,JERRY, Yeah,31
22217,KRAMER," Well, I knew him as well as she did.",31
22218,JERRY," Yeah, but John invited her.",31
22219,KRAMER," So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?",31
22220,JERRY," No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.",31
22221,GEORGE, It's George,31
22222,JERRY, Stop smelling your arm.,31
22223,KRAMER, You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach,31
22224,JERRY," Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, ""That's not a bad idea.""",31
22225,KRAMER, Tell me about it!,31
22226,JERRY," Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.",31
22227,GEORGE, Well it's over. It's definitely over.,31
22228,JERRY, She broke up with you?,31
22229,GEORGE," No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.",31
22230,JERRY, What was on the list?,31
22231,GEORGE," Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,",31
22232,JERRY," Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,",31
22233,GEORGE," Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said ""no, maybe we could get together for lunch."" You know what that means.",31
22234,JERRY, What's wrong with lunch?,31
22235,GEORGE, Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.,31
22236,KRAMER, I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?,31
22237,GEORGE, I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.,31
22238,KRAMER, Break up with her,31
22239,GEORGE, What?,31
22240,KRAMER, You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.,31
22241,JERRY, A preemptive breakup.,31
22242,GEORGE, A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.,31
22243,GEORGE," So, I am have to going to break up with you.",31
22244,GEORGE," I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.",31
22245,GEORGE, Shocked?,31
22246,GEORGE, Never expected this did you?,31
22247,GEORGE," Well, live and learn.",31
22248,GEORGE, Kind of.,31
22249,GEORGE," Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.",31
22250,GEORGE," Now, stop it ...",31
22251,GEORGE, When you're playing the piano do you think about me?,31
22252,GEORGE, This is what I'm talking about.,31
22253,GEORGE, All the time.,31
22254,GEORGE, I can't hear you.,31
22255,GEORGE," See, It's not so hard.",31
22256,KRAMER," Go ahead smell, smell",31
22257,KRAMER, Do you recognize it? ... The beach.,31
22258,KRAMER," Oh, I'm talking about the beach.",31
22259,KRAMER," You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.",31
22260,KRAMER," Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?",31
22261,KRAMER, So you don't think it's a good idea?,31
22262,ELAINE,"  Uh, you have to work like that?",31
22263,JERRY, In the freezer.,31
22264,JERRY, Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.,31
22265,JERRY, Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.,31
22266,ELAINE, What's the order?,31
22267,ELAINE, Albano is your last name.,31

22273,KRAMER, I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?,31
22274,KRAMER," Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.",31
22275,KRAMER," Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.",31
22276,JERRY," No, we're having an intervention",31
22277,JERRY, There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.,31
22278,ELAINE, Hide!,31
22279,JERRY, It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah ,31
22280,GEORGE, It's George,31
22281,JERRY," Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.",31
22282,ELAINE," Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.",31
22283,ELAINE, You're getting warm.,31
22284,GEORGE, We just came from Chadway's What's going on.,31
22285,JERRY, We're having the intervention for Richie.,31
22286,GEORGE," Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?",31
22287,JERRY," Well, uh..",31
22288,ELAINE," Oh, hi Noel",31
22289,JERRY," Well, you're looking well.",31
22290,GEORGE," Jerry, let me tell you something, ""A man without hand is not a man."" I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.",31
22291,GEORGE,  This man is a genius. Genius!,31
22292,GEORGE," I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you",31
22293,ELAINE, ,31
22294,ELAINE, ,31
22295,ELAINE," No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.",31
22296,JERRY, I didn't know she would laugh.,31
22297,GEORGE," No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?",31
22298,GEORGE, You can't break up with me. I've got hand.,31
22299,JERRY, Hey Richie,31
22300,JERRY," It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.",31
22301,GEORGE, I can't do these puzzles.,31
22302,JERRY, So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table,31
22303,GEORGE, Ah ah Pez dispenser.,31
22304,JERRY," He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them",31
22305,GEORGE, Well they're hard to load.,31
22306,JERRY, Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.,31
22307,GEORGE, Poor kid.,31
22308,JERRY, So as he's telling the story he starts crying.,31
22309,GEORGE, What did you do?,31
22310,JERRY, What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.,31
22311,GEORGE, Wow,31
22312,JERRY, Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.,31
22313,GEORGE, What's a three letter word for candy?,31
22314,JERRY, I can't do those things.,31
22315,JERRY,"The thing I don’t understand about the suicide person is the people who try and commit suicide for some reason they don’t die and that’s it. They stop trying. Why? Why don’t they just keep trying? What has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact it’s worse because now they’ve found out one more thing you stink at. Okay, that’s why these people don’t succeed in life to begin with. Because they give up too easy. I saw, pills don’t work, try a rope. Car won’t start in the garage, get a tune up. You know what I mean? There’s nothing more rewarding than reaching a goal you have set for yourself.",32
22316,JERRY, Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?,32
22317,ELAINE, Na.,32
22318,JERRY, What are you doing? We’re going out for dinner in ten minutes.,32
22319,ELAINE, Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?,32
22320,JERRY, Yeah.,32
22321,GEORGE, It’s George.,32
22322,JERRY, Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You’ve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?,32
22323,ELAINE, I don’t know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?,32
22324,JERRY, I think I’ll take out the garbage.,32
22325,ELAINE," Hey, have you ever fasted?",32
22326,JERRY," Well, once I didn’t have dinner until, like 9",32
22327,GEORGE," Yeah, right.",32
22328,JERRY," Come on, it’s just down the hall.",32
22329,GEORGE, Give me two bucks. I’ll do it for two bucks.,32
22330,JERRY, I’ll give you 50 cents.,32
22331,GEORGE, There’s no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.,32
22332,JERRY, Come on. Fifty cents.  a piece of Drake’s coffee cake,32
22333,GEORGE," You’re not getting no Drake’s Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, I’m all set. I got the ticket. I’m going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.",32
22334,JERRY, I don’t get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?,32
22335,GEORGE, It’s an incredible deal. I don’t know why you don’t come with me.,32
22336,JERRY," Nah, I don’t go for these non-refundable deals. I can’t commit to a woman. I’m not going to commit to an airline.",32
22337,JERRY, Hi.,32
22338,JERRY," Gina, do you know what a Drake’s Coffee Cake is?",32
22339,JERRY, How much do they cost?,32
22340,GEORGE," No, no the full size.",32
22341,JERRY," No, no the junior.",32
22342,GEORGE," You didn’t say ""junior"".",32
22343,JERRY, Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here!  How ya’ doing?,32
22344,JERRY, Boy she’s sexy isn’t she?,32
22345,JERRY, Do you believe that guy?,32
22346,ELAINE, What guy?,32
22347,JERRY, My neighbour,32
22348,ELAINE," Oh, that creepy guy?",32
22349,JERRY," Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?",32
22350,GEORGE, He didn’t seem too pleased.,32
22351,ELAINE, Maybe I’ll get a steak with french fried onion wings.,32
22352,GEORGE," hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.",32
22353,JERRY, What’s so amazing? You’ve seen him before.,32
22354,GEORGE, I haven’t seen him for months.,32
22355,JERRY, What was the dream?,32
22356,GEORGE, I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.,32
22357,JERRY, I think I’ve played there.,32
22358,GEORGE, I’ve had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.,32
22359,JERRY, You’re a little paranormal,32
22360,ELAINE," Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.",32
22361,GEORGE, Really?,32
22362,ELAINE," Uh uh, you should go some time.",32
22363,GEORGE, I’d love to go. Make an appointment.,32
22364,JERRY," Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?",32
22365,GEORGE, I just got fired.,32
22366,JERRY," Alright, come on, lets get out of here.",32
22367,ELAINE, I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.,32
22368,JERRY, I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.,32
22369,ELAINE, Really?,32
22370,JERRY," Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.",32
22371,JERRY, Who is it? Who is it?,32
22372,JERRY, Who?,32
22373,JERRY, Martine?,32
22374,JERRY," Oh, Martin!",32
22375,GEORGE, It’s Martine. I think he’s dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.,32
22376,JERRY, What?,32
22377,JERRY, In my pajamas? I better get my robe.,32
22378,JERRY, It’ll take two seconds.,32
22379,JERRY, We don’t have two seconds?,32
22380,JERRY," Nah, forget it.",32
22381,JERRY, Nah. I’ll just wear the pajamas.,32
22382,JERRY, Are you sure?,32
22383,JERRY," Nah, I’ll go get the robe.",32
22384,JERRY, That’s not too bad. It’s not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.,32
22385,JERRY, Really? It’s over?,32
22386,JERRY," Oh boy, did he say anything about me?",32
22387,JERRY, He said that?,32
22388,JERRY, I’m sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.,32
22389,JERRY, You weren’t?,32
22390,JERRY, Of course.,32
22391,JERRY," Are you sure he can’t hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.",32
22392,JERRY," I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they’re going to look at a thing like this.",32
22393,JERRY," No, I just wanted to see what time it was.",32
22394,JERRY, No.,32
22395,JERRY, Here?,32
22396,JERRY, Is this the proper venue?,32
22397,JERRY," No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.",32
22398,JERRY, I can’t. What if he wakes up?,32
22399,JERRY," A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy’s got a coma going like this … you don’t want to mess with it.",32
22400,KRAMER, Hey.,32
22401,JERRY, Hey.,32
22402,KRAMER, Did you hear about Martin?,32
22403,JERRY," Yeah, I heard.",32
22404,KRAMER, I can’t believe he’s in a coma.,32
22405,KRAMER, He’s got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?,32
22406,JERRY, Who told you about Martin?,32
22407,KRAMER, Newman! He’s good friends with him.,32
22408,JERRY," Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.",32
22409,KRAMER," He’s got all of my attachments, you know.",32
22410,JERRY," Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?",32
22411,KRAMER," What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?",32
22412,JERRY, You know I don’t get that whole suicide machine. There’s no tall buildings where these people live? They can’t wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?,32
22413,KRAMER, So what’s going on between you and Gina?,32
22414,JERRY," Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.",32
22415,KRAMER," Uh, uh.",32
22416,JERRY, So we’re in the room and she’s trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.,32
22417,KRAMER," Uh, uh, you see that’s the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?",32
22418,JERRY, Nothing.,32
22419,KRAMER," Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don’t have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?",32
22420,JERRY, I didn’t know what the coma etiquette was.,32
22421,KRAMER," There is no coma etiquette. You see that’s the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn’t matter what you do around it.",32
22422,JERRY," So you’re saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it’s all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.",32
22423,KRAMER," I’d give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can’t get out of it in 24 hours, it’s a land rush.",32
22424,JERRY," So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he’s thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there’s nothing left?",32
22425,KRAMER, NOTHING LEFT! That’s why I’m trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody’s going to grab it.,32
22426,ELAINE, Why would he come to George?,32
22427,GEORGE, I knew it. I always felt different.,32
22428,GEORGE, Drakes?,32
22429,GEORGE, Did you buy this for me?,32
22430,GEORGE," Ha, because I love Drake’s Coffee Cake.",32
22431,ELAINE, Take it away.,32
22432,GEORGE, She hasn’t eaten in two days.,32
22433,GEORGE, Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.,32
22434,GEORGE, When I hear her name mentioned.,32
22435,GEORGE," There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.",32
22436,GEORGE," Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?",32
22437,ELAINE, Should you be smoking?,32
22438,ELAINE, You’re pregnant.,32
22439,GEORGE, Elaine.,32
22440,GEORGE, Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?,32
22441,GEORGE, You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?,32
22442,ELAINE, It’s really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.,32
22443,GEORGE," Elaine, she’s a psychic. She knows how the kid’s going to be.",32
22444,GEORGE, Should I not go on this trip?,32
22445,ELAINE," Now listen. I just don’t know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.",32
22446,GEORGE," Elaine, what are you doing?",32
22447,ELAINE, It’s disgusting.,32
22448,ELAINE," Oh fine, I don’t like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.",32
22449,GEORGE, A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?,32
22450,GEORGE, If you don’t say anything I will assume it’s a plane crash.,32
22451,GEORGE, Not a plane crash.  Is it a plane crash?,32
22452,JERRY, You can say what you want about me but I’ll be damned if I’m going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.,32
22453,JERRY," No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.",32
22454,JERRY, They’re a comedy team.,32
22455,JERRY," Well, they’re three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.",32
22456,JERRY, I will show you The Stooges.,32
22457,JERRY," Well, I don’t really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.",32
22458,JERRY," Well, uh, I uh, I don’t want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it’s not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.",32
22459,JERRY, Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?,32
22460,JERRY," Yeah, all right. All right.",32
22461,KRAMER, You should just eat fruit.,32
22462,KRAMER, ???,32
22463,JERRY, Hello Newman.,32
22464,JERRY, Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.,32
22465,GEORGE," People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didn’t hurt me.",32
22466,ELAINE,  Did you see that wall move?,32
22467,JERRY," Boy, it’s a good thing we came.",32
22468,GEORGE, Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe there’s native unrest.,32
22469,ELAINE," Hi, I haven’t eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.",32
22470,JERRY," George, I want you to promise me something. If I’m ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.",32
22471,GEORGE, How come?,32
22472,JERRY, Looters.,32
22473,ELAINE, How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?,32
22474,JERRY, She’s really hungry.,32
22475,KRAMER, Hey.,32
22476,ELAINE, Kramer,32
22477,KRAMER," Well, Newman’s upstairs visiting Martin.",32
22478,GEORGE, Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?,32
22479,KRAMER, You’re not going?,32
22480,GEORGE, No.,32
22481,KRAMER, Why not?,32
22482,GEORGE, The psychic said something terrible will happen.,32
22483,KRAMER, I dig.,32
22484,KRAMER," I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, she’s going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, she’s going to kill me.",32
22485,KRAMER, Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?,32
22486,KRAMER, I don’t want a carpet sweeper. They don’t do anything.,32
22487,KRAMER, The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.,32
22488,KRAMER, I wouldn’t set foot in your house.,32
22489,JERRY, Hello.,32
22490,JERRY, How’s he doing?,32
22491,KRAMER, He looks happy to me.,32
22492,JERRY, Why wouldn’t he?,32
22493,JERRY," He’ll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.",32
22494,JERRY, How up to date?,32
22495,JERRY, And nothing could change your mind?,32
22496,KRAMER," Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. He’s not going.",32
22497,JERRY, Drake’s Coffee Cake,32
22498,JERRY, From my house. I got a whole box of them.,32
22499,JERRY, That’s your big boy.,32
22500,JERRY, I don’t give out bites. I got another one. But I’m saving it for later.,32
22501,JERRY," I don’t think so. You know they, they’re so fragile.",32
22502,JERRY, You swear?,32
22503,JERRY, On your mother’s life?,32
22504,KRAMER, oh oh oh oh oh,32
22505,ELAINE," And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.",32
22506,GEORGE," …sweetheart, no come here, … sweetheart",32
22507,GEORGE, how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.,32
22508,GEORGE," Oh, that’s great. That’s great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I don’t even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldn’t get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..",32
22509,GEORGE, I don’t know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why don’t you get a nurse for mommy? … Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.,32
22510,GEORGE," Yeah, why? Why?",32
22511,GEORGE, Because? Because?,32
22512,ELAINE, Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this! … Drake’s Coffee Cake? … Give me that.,32
22513,JERRY, Elaine! No! No!,32
22514,GEORGE, Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?,32
22515,KRAMER, I want my vacuum cleaner!,32
22516,JERRY, Hey!,32
22517,JERRY, What are you doing? We’re going out to dinner in ten minutes.,32
22518,GEORGE, I never assisted in a birth before. It’s really quite disgusting.,32
22519,JERRY, What did she name the kid?,32
22520,GEORGE, You wouldn’t believe it. Rasputin.,32
22521,KRAMER, Heey!,32
22522,GEORGE, Hey.,32
22523,JERRY, Hey.,32
22524,GEORGE, when did you get back?,32
22525,KRAMER, A couple of hours ago.,32
22526,GEORGE, So how was it?,32
22527,KRAMER," George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.",32
22528,JERRY, osh.,32
22529,KRAMER, They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.,32
22530,JERRY, Woah. ,32
22531,KRAMER, Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.,32
22532,JERRY, Wow! ,32
22533,KRAMER, I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson,32
22534,JERRY, Oh! ,32
22535,KRAMER, We played Backgammon in the nude.,32
22536,JERRY, Oh! ,32
22537,KRAMER, She’s a sweet kid.,32
22538,JERRY, Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!,32
22539,KRAMER," Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. That’s probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.",32
22540,GEORGE," Yeah, you gotta’ watch for the jellyfish.",32
22541,KRAMER, Yeah.,32
22542,KRAMER, What’s this?,32
22543,JERRY," Oh, it’s an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.",32
22544,KRAMER, They moved in together?,32
22545,JERRY," Yeah, it’s some place down in the village.",32
22546,KRAMER, Phew.,32
22547,JERRY, Yeah.,32
22548,ELAINE, It’s Elaine.,32
22549,JERRY, All right we’re coming down.,32
22550,KRAMER," Hey, where ya’ going?",32
22551,JERRY," We’re taking Elaine to dinner. She’s got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?",32
22552,KRAMER," Um, I’d like to but a bunch of us from the islands, we’ll be getting together.",32
22553,GEORGE, Elle McPherson going to be there?,32
22554,KRAMER, OH! I got to call her back.,32
22555,GEORGE," Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.",33
22556,JERRY," Oh, yes you will.",33
22557,GEORGE," No, I won't.",33
22558,JERRY," Yeah, maybe you won't.",33
22559,GEORGE," I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.",33
22560,JERRY, Are my nostrils getting bigger?,33
22561,GEORGE," No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, ""Hi. I'm",33
22562,ELAINE, I know.,33
22563,ELAINE, I hate the good ones.,33
22564,ELAINE," That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.",33
22565,ELAINE," You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.",33
22566,GEORGE, I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.,33
22567,JERRY," Oh, so there's still hope.",33
22568,GEORGE," I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.",33
22569,JERRY," Oh, so hopelessness is the key.",33
22570,GEORGE, It's my only hope.,33
22571,ELAINE," Well, at least you're not bitter.",33
22572,ELAINE, Aren't you too young to be bitter?,33
22573,ELAINE," Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.",33
22574,JERRY," Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.",33
22575,ELAINE, So what'd you do last night?,33
22576,JERRY," Went out with George, you?",33
22577,ELAINE, Went out with Cynthia.,33
22578,JERRY, How was it? What'd you talk about?,33
22579,ELAINE," Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?",33
22580,JERRY," We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.",33
22581,ELAINE," I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.",33
22582,JERRY, George too.,33
22583,JERRY," Yeah, right.",33
22584,ELAINE," Yeah, right.",33
22585,JERRY, I've never fixed anybody up.,33
22586,ELAINE," Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.",33
22587,JERRY, Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?,33
22588,ELAINE," I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?",33
22589,JERRY, Well you implied it.,33
22590,ELAINE, I didn't say it.,33
22591,JERRY," Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?",33
22592,ELAINE, Who is he?,33
22593,JERRY, He's George!,33
22594,ELAINE, She's Cynthia!,33
22595,JERRY, So what?,33
22596,ELAINE," What, you don't think she's beautiful?",33
22597,JERRY," I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?",33
22598,ELAINE, You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.,33
22599,JERRY, I went out with you.,33
22600,ELAINE," That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.",33
22601,JERRY," Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.",33
22602,ELAINE, He can really do that?,33
22603,JERRY," Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.",33
22604,ELAINE," What, are you into this?",33
22605,JERRY," Yeah, come on, it's a good match.",33
22606,ELAINE," No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?",33
22607,JERRY, Naturally.,33
22608,ELAINE," Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?",33
22609,JERRY, Everything.,33
22610,ELAINE, What if it worked out?,33
22611,GEORGE, Out of the question. Out of the question!,33
22612,JERRY, Why?,33
22613,GEORGE," No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?",33
22614,JERRY, She's good looking.,33
22615,GEORGE, How good looking?,33
22616,JERRY, Very good looking.,33
22617,GEORGE, Really good looking?,33
22618,JERRY, Really very good looking.,33
22619,GEORGE, Would you take her out?,33
22620,JERRY," Yes, I would take her out.",33
22621,GEORGE," Oh, you hesitated.",33
22622,JERRY, What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!,33
22623,GEORGE," No, something's off here, you hesitated.",33
22624,JERRY," I'm telling you, she's good looking.",33
22625,GEORGE," What about the body, what kind of body?",33
22626,JERRY," Good body, nice body.",33
22627,GEORGE, How nice?,33
22628,JERRY, Nice.,33
22629,GEORGE, Just nice?,33
22630,JERRY, Pretty nice.,33
22631,GEORGE, Really good?,33
22632,JERRY, Really very nice and good.,33
22633,GEORGE, What about personality?,33
22634,JERRY, Good personality. Funny. Bright.,33
22635,GEORGE, Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.,33
22636,JERRY, How could she be smarter than you?,33
22637,GEORGE," Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?",33
22638,ELAINE," He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-",33
22639,ELAINE," Well, um, he, he got fired.",33
22640,ELAINE," Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.",33
22641,ELAINE," Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.",33
22642,ELAINE," No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.",33
22643,ELAINE, Pardon?,33
22644,ELAINE," Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.",33
22645,ELAINE," Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.",33
22646,ELAINE," No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.",33
22647,ELAINE, Yup.,33
22648,GEORGE, What kind of hair?,33
22649,JERRY," You know, long dark hair.",33
22650,GEORGE, Flowing?,33
22651,JERRY, Flowing?,33
22652,GEORGE," Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.",33
22653,JERRY," 'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?",33
22654,GEORGE," Yeah, that's right.",33
22655,JERRY, Just clarifying.,33
22656,GEORGE, Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?,33
22657,JERRY, Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?,33
22658,GEORGE, I'd like to be able to get it out.,33
22659,JERRY, I think you'll get it out.,33
22660,GEORGE," What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.",33
22661,JERRY, She's got a fine cheek.,33
22662,GEORGE, Is there a pinkish hue?,33
22663,JERRY, A pinkish hue?,33
22664,GEORGE," Yes, a rosy glow.",33
22665,JERRY," There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.",33
22666,GEORGE," Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.",33
22667,JERRY, I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.,33
22668,ELAINE, No.,33
22669,ELAINE, He once spent a weekend with a woman.,33
22670,ELAINE," Yeah, he did.",33
22671,GEORGE," We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?",33
22672,JERRY, I think it's tamber.,33
22673,GEORGE," Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?",33
22674,JERRY, I didn't notice the voice.,33
22675,GEORGE, It's mellifluous!,33
22676,JERRY," So, Saturday night.",33
22677,GEORGE," She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.",33
22678,ELAINE, Hi.,33
22679,GEORGE, Hey! Saturday night!,33
22680,ELAINE, I know!,33

22683,GEORGE, That's it?,33
22684,ELAINE, Yeah!,33
22685,GEORGE, She didn't mention anything about the conversation?,33
22686,ELAINE, No.,33
22687,GEORGE," Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?",33
22688,ELAINE, What?,33
22689,JERRY, She could have mentioned the conversation.,33
22690,GEORGE," Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.",33
22691,KRAMER, Hey.,33
22692,JERRY, Hey.,33
22693,KRAMER," You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?",33
22694,JERRY," Oh, the guy from Jersey?",33
22695,KRAMER," Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.",33
22696,GEORGE, What are you gonna do with all of them?,33
22697,KRAMER," Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.",33
22698,JERRY," No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.",33
22699,KRAMER," Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.",33
22700,ELAINE," Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.",33
22701,GEORGE, I'll take one. It's possible.,33
22702,JERRY," So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?",33
22703,ELAINE, I think they went out to dinner.,33
22704,JERRY," Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?",33
22705,GEORGE," Yeah, it's me, I just got home.",33
22706,JERRY," Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.",33
22707,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.",33
22708,JERRY," Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.",33
22709,ELAINE, Remember our pact. Full disclosure.,33
22710,JERRY," Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.",33
22711,GEORGE," Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.",33
22712,JERRY," You can tell me, I'll vault it.",33
22713,GEORGE, It's in the vault?,33
22714,JERRY, I'm locking the vault. What?,33
22715,GEORGE, We had sex.,33
22716,JERRY," Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?",33
22717,GEORGE, I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.,33
22718,JERRY, At your apartment?,33
22719,GEORGE, Yeah.,33
22720,JERRY, She didn't stay over?,33
22721,GEORGE," No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.",33
22722,ELAINE, Oh my god.,33
22723,ELAINE, So? How was it?,33
22724,ELAINE," Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.",33
22725,ELAINE," Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello?",33
22726,JERRY," So, what did she have to say?",33
22727,ELAINE, What did he have to say?,33
22728,JERRY, He said they had a good time.,33
22729,ELAINE, Her too.,33
22730,JERRY," Oh, good.",33
22731,ELAINE, Anything else?,33
22732,JERRY, Nope. You?,33

22737,ELAINE," Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.",33
22738,JERRY, Yeah. Okay then.,33
22739,ELAINE, Alright. Goodnight.,33
22740,JERRY, Goodnight.,33
22741,GEORGE," I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.",33
22742,JERRY," Well, I'm gonna do something about this.",33
22743,GEORGE, What are you gonna do?,33
22744,JERRY," Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.",33
22745,GEORGE," I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.",33
22746,JERRY, I'm gonna call her.,33
22747,GEORGE," No, don't call her.",33
22748,JERRY," No, I'm calling her.",33
22749,GEORGE," No, Jerry, don't call.",33
22750,JERRY," No, forget it, I'm gonna call.",33
22751,GEORGE, I don't want you to call.,33
22752,JERRY," Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.",33
22753,GEORGE, Give me the phone!,33
22754,JERRY," George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?",33
22755,GEORGE," Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!",33
22756,KRAMER," Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!",33
22757,JERRY, I'll just call her when you leave!,33
22758,GEORGE," You can't do that, it's none of your business!",33
22759,JERRY, It is so my business!,33
22760,KRAMER, Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!,33
22761,GEORGE, But tell him to give me the--,33
22762,KRAMER," Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?",33
22763,GEORGE, No.,33
22764,JERRY," Yeah, but--",33
22765,KRAMER," Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.",33
22766,JERRY, But Kramer--,33
22767,KRAMER," Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.",33
22768,KRAMER," Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.",33
22769,GEORGE, What?,33
22770,KRAMER, Right.,33
22771,GEORGE, Defective?!,33
22772,KRAMER, Defective.,33
22773,GEORGE,  How could you give me a defective condom?!,33
22774,KRAMER, I didn't even know they were defective.,33
22775,KRAMER, Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.,33
22776,GEORGE, What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!,33
22777,JERRY," Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!",33
22778,ELAINE, Oh my god.,33
22779,ELAINE," But he used a condom, right?",33
22780,ELAINE, Oh no.,33
22781,ELAINE, Was it blue?,33
22782,ELAINE, Just a hunch.,33
22783,JERRY, Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!,33
22784,JERRY," Oh, hi. Soda?",33
22785,ELAINE, No thanks.,33
22786,JERRY, So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?,33
22787,ELAINE, Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.,33
22788,JERRY," Oh, I know her. I know her type.",33
22789,ELAINE, Her type? What type?,33
22790,JERRY," The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!",33
22791,ELAINE," You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!",33
22792,JERRY," I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.",33
22793,ELAINE, She's not bitter!,33
22794,JERRY," Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!",33
22795,ELAINE," Twisted? God, I did you a favor.",33
22796,JERRY," I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?",33
22797,ELAINE, Are you calling me a liar?,33
22798,JERRY," I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?",33
22799,ELAINE, Are you?,33
22800,JERRY, Get your finger out of my face.,33
22801,ELAINE," You get yours out, I was here first!",33
22802,JERRY, I don't care.,33
22803,ELAINE, Get it out!,33
22804,KRAMER," Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.",33
22805,ELAINE, I knew those condoms were defective!,33
22806,JERRY, How did you know they were defective?!,33
22807,ELAINE, Because! Because she missed her period!,33
22808,GEORGE, She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!,33
22809,ELAINE, Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.,33
22810,ELAINE, Hi!,33
22811,GEORGE," Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.",33
22812,ELAINE, What happened?,33
22813,JERRY, Acting.,33
22814,ELAINE, Very mature.,33
22815,JERRY, Thank you. Hi Cynthia.,33
22816,JERRY, Well this is a great place to sit you got here.,33
22817,GEORGE,"  Stop it, stop it.",33
22818,JERRY, So what are these?,33
22819,ELAINE," Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.",33
22820,GEORGE,"  This is good. Oh, this is good.",33
22821,KRAMER," Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.",34
22822,GEORGE, Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.,34
22823,JERRY," I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.",34
22824,GEORGE, Oh I'm a chucker.,34
22825,JERRY," That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.",34
22826,GEORGE," I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!",34
22827,JERRY, You chuck.,34
22828,GEORGE, Kramer am I a chucker?,34
22829,KRAMER, You're a chucker.,34
22830,GEORGE, All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?,34
22831,JERRY, Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.,34
22832,KRAMER, Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.,34
22833,JERRY, Believe me I didn't see anything.,34
22834,KRAMER," Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?",34
22835,JERRY," No, did you?",34
22836,KRAMER," Yeah, I snuck a peak.",34
22837,JERRY, Why?,34
22838,KRAMER, Why not? hey what about you George?,34
22839,GEORGE," yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.",34
22840,JERRY, I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.,34
22841,KRAMER," Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.",34
22842,JERRY, All right,34
22843,KRAMER, Have a good one.,34
22844,JERRY, All right,34
22845,GEORGE, See ya.,34
22846,GEORGE, look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?,34
22847,JERRY, You know who that is? That's,34
22848,GEORGE, Keith Hernandez? The baseball player?,34
22849,JERRY," Yeah, that's him.",34
22850,GEORGE, Are you sure?,34
22851,JERRY, Positive.,34
22852,GEORGE," Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.",34
22853,JERRY," Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.",34
22854,GEORGE, I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff,34
22855,JERRY, So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.,34
22856,GEORGE, ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension,34
22857,JERRY," Hey, should we say something to him?",34
22858,GEORGE," Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.",34
22859,JERRY, well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.,34
22860,GEORGE, He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.,34
22861,JERRY, So?,34
22862,GEORGE," What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!",34
22863,JERRY, I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.,34
22864,GEORGE," What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.",34
22865,JERRY, Really?,34
22866,JERRY, What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time,34
22867,GEORGE, Mine too.,34
22868,JERRY, Thank you.,34
22869,GEORGE," You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...",34
22870,JERRY, I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.,34
22871,GEORGE," But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.",34
22872,JERRY," I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.",34
22873,JERRY, Oh. that would be great.,34
22874,GEORGE," Uh, it's only a matter of time.",34
22875,JERRY, It's been three days and he hasn't called.,34
22876,ELAINE, Well maybe you should call him.,34
22877,JERRY, I can't ... I can't,34
22878,ELAINE, Why not?,34
22879,JERRY, I don't know. I just feel he should call me.,34
22880,ELAINE, What's the difference?,34
22881,JERRY," You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.",34
22882,ELAINE," Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.",34
22883,JERRY, I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?,34
22884,ELAINE, I'm sorry honey.,34
22885,JERRY," I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.",34
22886,ELAINE," No,",34
22887,JERRY, Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?,34
22888,ELAINE, I know.,34
22889,JERRY," What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.",34

22950,KRAMER, Let me tell it ..,34
22951,KRAMER, You always tell it ..,34
22952,KRAMER, Ja ja ja - just tell it,34
22953,KRAMER," Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, "" Nice game pretty boy."". Keith continued past us up the ramp.",34
22954,ELAINE, What was it?,34
22955,KRAMER," He spit on us.... and I screamed out, ""I'm hit!""",34
22956,ELAINE, Wow! What a story.,34
22957,JERRY, Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.,34
22958,JERRY," Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.",34
22959,JERRY, What happened to your head when you got hit?,34
22960,KRAMER," Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left",34
22961,JERRY, Again,34
22962,KRAMER, Back and to the left,34
22963,JERRY, Back and to the left Back and to the left,34
22964,ELAINE," So, what are you saying?",34
22965,JERRY, I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.,34
22966,ELAINE, So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.,34
22967,JERRY, But that is not what they would have you believe.,34
22968,KRAMER," Wait, wait, ",34
22969,JERRY, The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.,34
22970,GEORGE,  Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?,34
22971,JERRY, No. What happened to you?,34
22972,GEORGE," Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer ""Vandelay Industries"".",34
22973,JERRY, I'm Vandelay Industries?,34
22974,GEORGE, Right.,34
22975,JERRY, And what is that?,34

22984,JERRY, I don't think so. Why would I do that?,34
22985,GEORGE, Because I asked you to.,34
22986,JERRY," If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.",34

23246,JERRY,"Do you think that the people at the airport that run the stores have any idea what the prices are every place else in the world? Or do you think they just feel they have their own little country out there and they can charge anything they want? You're hungry? Tuna sandwich is nine dollars. You don't like it; go back to your own country. I think the whole airport airline complex is a huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches. I think that profit is what's supporting the whole air travel industry. I mean think about it; the terminals, the airplanes, it's all just a distraction so that you don't notice the beating that you're taking on the tuna.",36
23247,GEORGE, It's all departures. I see nothing but departures.  Do you know where the arrivals are?,36

23272,GEORGE," We just go up to him, we say, ""We're O'Brien.""",36
23273,JERRY, Maybe he knows O'Brien?,36
23274,GEORGE," No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.",36
23275,JERRY, What if we get caught?,36
23276,GEORGE, What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.,36
23277,JERRY, Who's gonna be O'Brien?,36
23278,GEORGE, I'll be O'Brien.,36

23302,JERRY, What for?,36
23303,GEORGE," I dunno, I'm in a limo.  Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!",36

23308,JERRY, He can't hear us.,36
23309,GEORGE," Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.",36
23310,JERRY, Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?,36
23311,GEORGE," We'll ask him.  My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?",36
23312,GEORGE," Of course, the uh, the four passes.  Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!",36
23313,JERRY, What?,36

23315,JERRY, We're going to the Knick game!,36
23316,GEORGE, Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!,36
23317,JERRY, I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!,36
23318,GEORGE," You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?",36
23319,JERRY, Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.,36
23320,GEORGE," If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'",36
23321,JERRY," Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye.  'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.",36
23322,GEORGE, Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?,36
23323,JERRY, Maybe it's a shortcut.,36
23324,GEORGE," We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.",36
23325,JERRY,"  'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?",36
23326,GEORGE," Right. The other members of our party.  Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.",36
23327,JERRY," It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.",36
23328,GEORGE, It was a good jig.,36
23329,JERRY," It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.",36
23330,GEORGE, There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.,36
23331,JERRY," First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.",36
23332,GEORGE, Well you should have been O'Brien.,36
23333,JERRY, I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?,36
23334,GEORGE," Yes, you have to be Murphy.",36
23335,JERRY," It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.",36
23336,GEORGE, You're Murphy!,36
23337,JERRY, I'm Seinfeld!,36
23338,GEORGE," You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.",36
23339,JERRY, We're doing sixty miles an hour!,36
23340,GEORGE," So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.",36
23341,JERRY," Who are you, Mannix?",36
23342,GEORGE, We're slowing down. Are those the people?,36
23343,JERRY," Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.",36
23344,JERRY," No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.",36
23345,JERRY, Newsletter?,36
23346,JERRY," Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?",36
23347,JERRY, Never seen a picture of him?,36
23348,JERRY, Not even on the book jacket?,36
23349,JERRY,"  Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.",36
23350,GEORGE, Hello. I'm O'Brien.,36
23351,KRAMER, Hey!,36
23352,ELAINE, Hey!,36
23353,KRAMER," What, you took a cab?",36
23354,ELAINE, Yeah? So?,36
23355,KRAMER, How much do you make?,36
23356,ELAINE, I'm not telling you.,36
23357,KRAMER, C'mon.,36
23358,ELAINE, No!,36
23359,KRAMER, I'll tell you how much I make.,36
23360,ELAINE," I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.",36
23361,KRAMER, You ever seen Michael Jordan?,36
23362,ELAINE, Just in those commercials.,36
23363,KRAMER, Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.,36
23364,ELAINE, What's that?,36
23365,KRAMER," Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.",36
23366,ELAINE, Huh?,36
23367,KRAMER, Yeah.,36
23368,JERRY,  I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.,36
23369,GEORGE," So, um, you've read ""The Big Game"", have you?",36
23370,GEORGE," Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of ""The Big Game"".",36
23371,GEORGE," Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.",36
23372,GEORGE," Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.",36
23373,JERRY, He tends to exaggerate.,36
23374,GEORGE," Okay, I mean it's serious but--",36
23375,GEORGE," Uh, my speech?",36
23376,JERRY, Well you might as well look it over.,36
23377,KRAMER," So what's going on, how did all this happen?",36
23378,ELAINE, Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.,36
23379,KRAMER, Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.,36
23380,ELAINE, He did.,36
23381,KRAMER, Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?,36
23382,ELAINE, I don't know.,36
23383,KRAMER, That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?,36
23384,ELAINE," Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.",36
23385,KRAMER, O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?,36
23386,GEORGE, ...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.,36
23387,JERRY," You're not going to open with that, are you?",36
23388,GEORGE, I said so many things.,36
23389,GEORGE, They're shooting! They're shooting!,36
23390,GEORGE," That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.",36
23391,JERRY, Nice looking Lugar.,36
23392,KRAMER," Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?",36
23393,ELAINE," Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?",36
23394,ELAINE," Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.",36
23395,ELAINE, What's going on?,36
23396,ELAINE," Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.",36
23397,ELAINE," Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.",36
23398,KRAMER, Who?,36
23399,JERRY, What's taking him so long out there?,36
23400,GEORGE, Didja see the way she was looking at me?,36
23401,JERRY," She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!",36
23402,GEORGE," I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.",36
23403,JERRY," Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?",36
23404,GEORGE, I don't know.,36
23405,JERRY, Let's just make a run for it.,36
23406,GEORGE," I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.",36
23407,JERRY, How'd that happen?,36
23408,GEORGE, I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.,36
23409,JERRY," I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.",36
23410,GEORGE," For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.",36
23411,GEORGE," 9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--",36
23412,GEORGE," --Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.",36
23413,GEORGE," Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.",36
23414,GEORGE," Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?",36
23415,GEORGE, And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?,36
23416,GEORGE, Good. I think you forgot something.,36
23417,GEORGE, Good. Now get out.,36
23418,GEORGE," Okay, what are we gonna do?",36
23419,JERRY, I don't know.,36
23420,GEORGE," Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.",36
23421,JERRY, Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.,36
23422,KRAMER," I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.",36
23423,ELAINE, I'm sure he was just joking around.,36
23424,KRAMER," Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!",36
23425,ELAINE, What is it?,36
23426,KRAMER," Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!",36
23427,ELAINE, Jerry's a nazi?!,36
23428,KRAMER, I can't believe I didn't see it.,36
23429,ELAINE," Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.",36
23430,KRAMER, You don't think so.,36
23431,ELAINE," No, he's just neat.",36
23432,GEORGE, Me??,36
23433,JERRY, I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.,36
23434,GEORGE, He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.,36
23435,JERRY," Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.",36
23436,JERRY, We were right on the border.,36
23437,KRAMER, Maybe he's with the company.,36
23438,ELAINE, What?,36
23439,KRAMER, The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.,36
23440,ELAINE, What about his comedy act?,36
23441,KRAMER," That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.",36
23442,ELAINE, What about George?,36
23443,KRAMER," What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!",36
23444,ELAINE, I'll bet they were even in on it.,36
23445,KRAMER," Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you.  I'm not gonna.",36
23446,ELAINE," Kramer, you're hurting me!",36
23447,GEORGE," Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.",36
23448,ELAINE, Get off of me!!,36
23449,KRAMER, O'Brien.,36
23450,GEORGE, What do I do?! What do I do?!,36
23451,JERRY, Get in the car! Get in the car!,36
23452,KRAMER,"  O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?",36
23453,JERRY," No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.",36
23454,ELAINE, It could be very confusing.,36
23455,KRAMER, Yeah? Eva?,36
23456,KRAMER, O'Brien? Well that's weird.,36
23457,ELAINE," Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!",36
23458,ELAINE, Hey!,36
23459,GEORGE, I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!,36
23460,ELAINE," You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?",37
23461,JERRY, It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.,37
23462,JERRY, Oh look at this guy.,37
23463,ELAINE, What's goin' on?,37
23464,JERRY," Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.",37
23465,ELAINE, Did you get a thank you wave?,37
23466,JERRY," No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?",37
23467,JERRY, Give me that wave!,37
23468,ELAINE," Jerry, are you free on Friday?",37
23469,JERRY," Yeah, I'm free, why?",37
23470,ELAINE," Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.",37
23471,JERRY," Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!",37
23472,ELAINE, You gotta follow that car!,37
23473,JERRY, What?,37
23474,ELAINE, You can't let him get away with that!,37
23475,JERRY," Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.",37
23476,ELAINE," What are you, yellow?",37
23477,JERRY, I'm not yella. ,37
23478,ELAINE," Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.",37
23479,JERRY," Wait, he stopped, he's parking.",37
23480,ELAINE, What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?,37
23481,JERRY," Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.",37
23482,JERRY, So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.,37
23483,GEORGE, Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.,37
23484,JERRY," You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.",37
23485,JERRY," He, he, he. ",37
23486,GEORGE, I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?,37
23487,JERRY, Let's not even analyze it.,37
23488,GEORGE, So you didn't turn her in?,37
23489,JERRY, I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.,37
23490,GEORGE, Gonna see her again?,37
23491,JERRY, Friday night.,37
23492,JERRY, Yep.,37
23493,ELAINE, It's me!,37
23494,JERRY, Come on up.,37
23495,JERRY," By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.",37
23496,GEORGE," Hey, hey, hey! I dig.",37
23497,JERRY," Oh, you dig?",37
23498,GEORGE, Yes! I see enormous potential here.,37
23499,JERRY, Why?,37
23500,GEORGE, Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.,37
23501,JERRY, I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.,37
23502,GEORGE, I don't think so.,37
23503,JERRY," Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!",37
23504,JERRY," On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!",37
23505,JERRY," What am I drinking, milk?",37
23506,ELAINE, Hey!,37
23507,JERRY, Hi.,37
23508,ELAINE, Sweater.,37
23509,JERRY, Thank you.,37
23510,ELAINE, So? What happened?,37
23511,JERRY, With that?,37
23512,ELAINE, With the car!,37
23513,JERRY, What car?,37
23514,ELAINE, The hit and run!,37
23515,JERRY," Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.",37
23516,ELAINE, Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?,37
23517,JERRY, Over the bridge. ,37
23518,GEORGE," Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.",37
23519,JERRY," Yeah, Queens.",37
23520,ELAINE, So? Then what?,37
23521,JERRY," So he gets out of the car, I say, ""Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!"" So he says to me, ""What are ya gonna do about it?""",37
23522,JERRY," So I said to him, ""Whatever's necessary.""",37
23523,ELAINE, I am speechless. I am without speech.,37
23524,GEORGE, Tell her about the shoving.,37
23525,JERRY, What?,37
23526,ELAINE, What shoving?!,37
23527,JERRY," Oh, it was nothing.",37
23528,GEORGE, No! Tell her.,37
23529,ELAINE, You know karate??,37
23530,JERRY, I know a little.,37
23531,ELAINE," Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?",37
23532,JERRY, He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.,37
23533,KRAMER, Hey! ,37
23534,ELAINE, Did you tell Kramer?,37
23535,JERRY," Ah, nah! ",37
23536,KRAMER, What? What? What? Tell me.,37
23537,ELAINE," Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.",37
23538,KRAMER," Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. ",37
23539,KRAMER, They should be sent to Australia.,37
23540,JERRY, Australia?,37
23541,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.",37
23542,JERRY, But not anymore.,37
23543,KRAMER, No.,37
23544,ELAINE," Hey Kramer, Kramer!",37
23545,KRAMER, Yeah?,37
23546,ELAINE, What happened to you right here? ,37
23547,KRAMER, I don't know!,37
23548,KRAMER," You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.",37
23549,ELAINE," Well, that is, that is strange.",37
23550,KRAMER, Yep. ,37
23551,ELAINE," Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?",37
23552,JERRY," Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.",37
23553,ELAINE, But last night you said you were free! ,37
23554,JERRY, We just met.,37
23555,KRAMER, Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.,37
23556,ELAINE," But I, I can't go alone!",37
23557,JERRY, Ask George to go with you.,37
23558,ELAINE," George, come on! I'll pay for you.",37
23559,GEORGE, You'll pay? I'm there.,37
23560,JERRY, Why do you even need anybody?,37
23561,ELAINE," Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. ",37
23562,ELAINE," Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.",37
23563,ELAINE," His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.",37
23564,GEORGE, Pass the salt please.,37
23565,ELAINE," Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.",37
23566,GEORGE, Bread.,37
23567,ELAINE, I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.,37
23568,GEORGE, God bless you.,37
23569,GEORGE," I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. ",37
23570,JERRY," Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.",37
23571,JERRY, Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.,37
23572,GEORGE," No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.",37
23573,JERRY," Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.",37
23574,GEORGE, I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?,37
23575,JERRY," The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.",37
23576,ELAINE, It's me.,37
23577,JERRY, Come on up.,37
23578,GEORGE," Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this",37
23579,JERRY," No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.",37
23580,GEORGE," Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.",37
23581,JERRY, What if she's having an off night?,37
23582,ELAINE, Hi!,37
23583,JERRY, Hi.,37
23584,ELAINE, Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!,37
23585,GEORGE," Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.",37
23586,GEORGE," Ah, shut up.",37
23587,ELAINE, What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.,37
23588,JERRY, A stupid what?,37
23589,ELAINE, Whatever.,37
23590,JERRY," You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.",37
23591,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.",37
23592,GEORGE, Who?,37
23593,ELAINE, Robin!,37
23594,GEORGE, Why?!,37
23595,ELAINE," Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.",37
23596,JERRY, Entertainment Tonight's on.,37
23597,GEORGE, Where's the remote phone?,37
23598,JERRY, Bedroom.,37
23599,ELAINE," Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?",37
23600,JERRY, What's it like out?,37
23601,ELAINE, Chilly out.,37
23602,JERRY, Can I take a sweater?,37
23603,ELAINE," Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.",37
23604,JERRY, Scarf?,37
23605,ELAINE," Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.",37
23606,JERRY, What's the matter? What's going on?,37
23607,KRAMER, What happened?!,37
23608,ELAINE, What?,37
23609,KRAMER, I think I hit my head again!,37
23610,JERRY, What is wrong?!,37
23611,ELAINE," Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?",37
23612,KRAMER, Yeah.,37
23613,ELAINE, That is it!,37
23614,KRAMER, What?,37
23615,ELAINE," That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!",37
23616,KRAMER, Mary Hart!,37
23617,GEORGE, God.,37
23618,ELAINE, What?,37
23619,GEORGE," Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.",37
23620,JERRY, Get together?,37
23621,GEORGE, Maybe she just wants to talk to me?,37
23622,ELAINE, Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.,37
23623,GEORGE," Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.",37
23624,ELAINE, Are you actually considering this?,37
23625,GEORGE," I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!",37
23626,ELAINE," Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.",37
23627,JERRY, Yeah.,37
23628,KRAMER," Hey, you know who owns that car?",37
23629,JERRY, What car?,37
23630,KRAMER, The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.,37
23631,JERRY, Yeah who?,37
23632,KRAMER," That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.",37
23633,JERRY," The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.",37
23634,ELAINE, Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.,37
23635,KRAMER," Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?",37
23636,JERRY, The blond with the blue sweatpants!,37
23637,GEORGE," Well, who is she?",37
23638,JERRY, I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.,37
23639,GEORGE," Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.",37
23640,JERRY," Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!",37
23641,GEORGE, You can't compromise your principles!,37
23642,JERRY, How am I going to live with myself?!,37
23643,GEORGE, Can't live!,37
23644,JERRY," I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!",37
23645,GEORGE, This country needs more people like you!,37
23646,JERRY," Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.",37
23647,GEORGE, I believe strongly in that as you know.,37
23648,JERRY, There should be more people like us.,37
23649,GEORGE, That's why the world's in the shape it's in.,37
23650,JERRY, You're telling me.,37
23651,JERRY," Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.",37
23652,JERRY, Thank you very much.,37
23653,GEORGE, Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?,37
23654,GEORGE, What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!,37
23655,GEORGE, Oh yeah.,37
23656,GEORGE," Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.",37
23657,GEORGE," Well, that's a given.",37
23658,GEORGE, Must be hell living in that house.,37
23659,ELAINE," Hi, Michael!",37
23660,ELAINE," Robin? No, why?",37
23661,ELAINE," No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.",37
23662,ELAINE," Well I, I don't know.",37
23663,ELAINE," No, no, come on Michael!",37
23664,ELAINE, You're soo good lookin'.,37
23665,JERRY, Let me rephra-,37
23666,JERRY," Hi Elaine, this is Angela.",37
23667,JERRY, Well I think I get the gist of it.,37
23668,JERRY, What car?,37
23669,JERRY, It's not complicated.,37
23670,ELAINE, Very nice meeting you!,37
23671,ELAINE, Come on up.,37
23672,ELAINE," Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.",37
23673,JERRY, Alright Elaine.,37
23674,ELAINE," No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!",37
23675,JERRY, It was just a couple of blocks.,37
23676,ELAINE," Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!",37
23677,GEORGE, Hey.,37
23678,ELAINE," Oh, did you check you machine?",37
23679,GEORGE," No, why, what's happening?",37
23680,ELAINE," Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.",37
23681,GEORGE," Yeah, okay.",37
23682,ELAINE, And I said I hadn't seen her.,37
23683,GEORGE, What?!,37
23684,ELAINE," No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.",37
23685,GEORGE, He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!,37
23686,ELAINE, He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.,37
23687,GEORGE, What? Why couldn't you think of something?!,37
23688,ELAINE," Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!",37
23689,GEORGE, You lie! How hard is it to lie?!,37
23690,JERRY, It's not that hard.,37
23691,ELAINE, Well who told you to sleep with her George?!,37
23692,GEORGE, It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!,37
23693,ELAINE, Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!,37
23694,GEORGE, Oh don't-,37
23695,JERRY, Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?,37
23696,GEORGE, She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.,37
23697,JERRY," A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?",37
23698,ELAINE," Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.",37
23699,JERRY," Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!",37
23700,JERRY," Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.",37
23701,JERRY, $875?,37
23702,JERRY," Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.",37
23703,JERRY," Um, who do I make it out to?",37
23704,JERRY," So, what are you doing this weekend?",37
23705,JERRY, I didn't do it!,37
23706,JERRY, You are soo good lookin'.,37
23707,GEORGE," Jerry, let's go! You ready?",37
23708,JERRY, You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!,37
23709,GEORGE," Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.",37
23710,JERRY, Alright!,37
23711,GEORGE, Come on let's get out of here.,37
23712,KRAMER, How could you?,37
23713,JERRY, What?!,37
23714,KRAMER, Man! I never thought you were capable of this!,37
23715,JERRY, What did I do?,37
23716,KRAMER," I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.",37
23717,JERRY, I-,37
23718,KRAMER, I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.,37
23719,JERRY, I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!,37
23720,KRAMER," Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?",37
23721,JERRY," No, never.",37
23722,KRAMER, Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.,37
23723,JERRY, You got a date with Becky Gelke?!,37
23724,KRAMER," Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.",37
23725,GEORGE," Jerry, can we get out of here?!",37
23726,KRAMER," As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.",37
23727,JERRY," Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.",37
23728,KRAMER, You sure you don’t want me to take my clothes off?  I’ll do it!,38
23729,KRAMER," Well, why don’t you take your clothes off?",38
23730,KRAMER,"  Well, it’d be our little secret.",38
23731,GEORGE,  Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!,38
23732,JERRY, I like the button fly.,38
23733,GEORGE,  What?,38
23734,JERRY, That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. It’s like a mink trap down there.  What are you doing today?,38
23735,GEORGE, Nothing.,38
23736,JERRY," I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?",38
23737,GEORGE, I don’t get art.,38
23738,JERRY, There’s nothing to get.,38
23739,GEORGE," Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.",38
23740,JERRY, She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.,38
23741,GEORGE, What for?,38
23742,JERRY, She sees something in him.,38
23743,GEORGE," So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.",38
23744,KRAMER," Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown.  Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.",38
23745,KRAMER," She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.",38
23746,KRAMER," Oh yeah, they're like this .",38
23747,KRAMER," Why, what's the difference?",38
23748,KRAMER," Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.",38
23749,GEORGE," You know, I'm a little nervous.",38
23750,JERRY, Why?,38
23751,GEORGE," Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.",38
23752,JERRY, I don't know how long this is gonna last.,38
23753,GEORGE, Really? I thought you liked her.,38
23754,JERRY, I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. ,38
23755,GEORGE," You know, it's a miracle you're not married.  Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?",38
23756,JERRY," Hi, Nina.  This is my friend George.",38
23757,JERRY,"  Hey, look at this guy!",38
23758,KRAMER, Yeah!,38
23759,JERRY,  I brought George up to see some of your paintings.,38
23760,GEORGE,"  Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.",38
23761,KRAMER," George, you gonna buy a painting?",38
23762,GEORGE,"  Yeah, sure.",38
23763,GEORGE, I am an art-adorer! I adore art.,38
23764,JERRY, May I? ,38
23765,JERRY, What's this?,38
23766,JERRY,"  Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.",38
23767,KRAMER,  Yeah.,38
23768,JERRY," They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!",38
23769,GEORGE," Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?",38
23770,GEORGE," All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!",38
23771,GEORGE, Look at where we are!  He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going!  We're not in the first row?,38
23772,GEORGE, She said first row! Right behind the dugout!,38
23773,ELAINE," Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.",38
23774,GEORGE, I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!,38
23775,ELAINE, Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.,38
23776,GEORGE," Oh, there's better,  right there, that's better.",38
23777,KRAMER," Right.  Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? What a great day!",38
23778,ELAINE, I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.,38
23779,GEORGE,  You're supposed to do that?,38
23780,ELAINE,  Yeah.  What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?,38
23781,GEORGE, I'd rather go to a hanging.,38
23782,ELAINE," Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. ",38
23783,KRAMER,"  YOU BETTER CATCH IT,",38
23784,GEORGE, Yeah?,38
23785,GEORGE," Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--",38
23786,ELAINE, Hi!,38
23787,KRAMER,"  HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!",38
23788,GEORGE, --and this is Kramer.,38
23789,KRAMER," Oh, hey.",38
23790,GEORGE, Okay.,38
23791,ELAINE," Great, great.",38
23792,KRAMER, Yeah.,38
23793,GEORGE," Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs.  Not, uh, too expensive, is it?",38
23794,ELAINE,  Yeah. I better!,38
23795,ELAINE, You're not serious.,38
23796,ELAINE," Well, did he say that?",38
23797,ELAINE, Well maybe you should ask him!,38
23798,ELAINE," No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!",38
23799,GEORGE, Just take the cap off.,38
23800,ELAINE," George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!",38
23801,ELAINE," Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.",38
23802,GEORGE, Just take the cap off!,38
23803,ELAINE, No!,38
23804,KRAMER, Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!,38
23805,GEORGE,  Do you want us to go with you?,38
23806,KRAMER,"  I'll go get your hat, George.",38
23807,ELAINE,  Stay!,38
23808,GEORGE," Okay, we'll go!",38
23809,ELAINE, ...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!,38
23810,JERRY, Is he okay?,38
23811,ELAINE," Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative.  It was quite a day!",38
23812,JERRY, This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!,38
23813,ELAINE, I know! Can you imagine that?,38
23814,JERRY, How you feeling?,38
23815,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.  Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.",38
23816,ELAINE, Wha- a picture?,38
23817,KRAMER, A picture.,38
23818,ELAINE, OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??,38
23819,KRAMER, Uh-huh.,38
23820,ELAINE,  I cannot believe this!,38
23821,JERRY,  There's George!,38
23822,KRAMER," Yup, yup!",38
23823,ELAINE, Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!,38
23824,ELAINE," Hi, Mr. Lippman.",38
23825,ELAINE," My, my father?",38
23826,ELAINE, Yeah.,38
23827,ELAINE, I went to visit him.,38
23828,ELAINE," Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...",38
23829,ELAINE," Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed  his spirits.",38
23830,ELAINE, What--what did I say?,38
23831,ELAINE, I did?,38
23832,ELAINE, Oh! Where are you going?,38
23833,ELAINE, Ah. ...Yeah.,38
23834,ELAINE," There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...",38
23835,ELAINE," Wha-- oh!  Oh, god!  That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH!  Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... ",38
23836,ELAINE," Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty!  I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!",38
23837,JERRY, It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game.  How can you defend that?,38
23838,JERRY," Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.",38
23839,JERRY," Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!",38
23840,GEORGE, Five-hundred dollars?! What?,38
23841,JERRY, That's what she told me!,38
23842,GEORGE, I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!,38
23843,JERRY, That's what it costs!,38
23844,GEORGE, Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!,38
23845,JERRY, I wasn't thinking! I don't know.,38
23846,GEORGE, You weren't thinking.,38
23847,JERRY," Well, she framed it and everything.",38
23848,GEORGE," Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this!  I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines!  Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?",38
23849,JERRY, Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!,38
23850,GEORGE," I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.",38
23851,KRAMER,  This was in front of your door.,38
23852,GEORGE," Hey, Kramer.",38
23853,KRAMER," Hi, Mike.",38
23854,JERRY,"  Wow, a letter from Nina!",38
23855,KRAMER,"  Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!",38
23856,JERRY,  Oh my god!,38
23857,GEORGE, What?,38
23858,JERRY," This is amazing, you can't believe this!",38
23859,GEORGE, What's it say?,38
23860,JERRY, Listen to this,38
23861,GEORGE, WOW!,38
23862,KRAMER,  She's deep.,38
23863,JERRY,"  ""...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-""",38
23864,KRAMER," You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!",38
23865,JERRY, No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!,38
23866,KRAMER,  Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!,38
23867,JERRY, Should I?,38
23868,KRAMER,"  YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD!  Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!",38
23869,JERRY," ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.",38
23870,JERRY, SHOT!  I told ya!  Yeah?,38
23871,GEORGE,  It's George.,38
23872,JERRY," Come on up.  Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.",38
23873,JERRY," The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.",38
23874,GEORGE," Hey, Nina!  I owe you some money, don't I?",38
23875,GEORGE," Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.",38
23876,GEORGE, This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.,38
23877,GEORGE, Who said anything about money? ,38
23878,JERRY, Yeah?,38
23879,ELAINE,  It's Elaine.,38
23880,JERRY, Come on up.,38
23881,JERRY, ...Yeah.,38
23882,JERRY," She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in.  He likes the pop-in, too.",38
23883,GEORGE, I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.,38
23884,JERRY, Yeah.,38
23885,GEORGE, How 'bout Kramer.,38
23886,JERRY, HUGE pop-in guy!,38
23887,JERRY, Yeah.,38
23888,JERRY, Okay!,38
23889,ELAINE,  Hello!,38
23890,ELAINE,"  Chatty gal.  Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!",38
23891,JERRY," If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!",38
23892,ELAINE," No, he wants to torture me.",38
23893,ELAINE,  Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! ,38
23894,JERRY,  I'm a great clicker!  Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.,38
23895,ELAINE, You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.,38
23896,JERRY, Let go!,38
23897,ELAINE," No, come on! I want it, Jerry!",38
23898,JERRY," Let go, Elaine!",38
23899,ELAINE, Well at least let George do it!,38
23900,JERRY," Oh, George can't click! ",38
23901,GEORGE,  Give it! Give it!  Pinheads.,38
23902,JERRY," Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. ",38
23903,ELAINE," It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.",38
23904,JERRY,"  Wait a second... wait a second!!  The letter, that's the letter!",38
23905,ELAINE, What letter?,38
23906,JERRY," This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!",38
23907,JERRY," ""...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!""",38
23908,GEORGE, This is incredible!,38
23909,JERRY," I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!",38
23910,GEORGE, Maybe I won't send her that check.,38
23911,ELAINE," You know, it's not really that terrible.",38
23912,JERRY, What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself!  I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!,38
23913,ELAINE," Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.",38
23914,ELAINE," Well, uh, fan. My father--",38
23915,ELAINE, Really?,38
23916,ELAINE, So... impudent.,38
23917,ELAINE,"  Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--",38
23918,ELAINE,  Okay.,38
23919,ELAINE, That will be fun.,38
23920,JERRY, How's it coming?,38
23921,JERRY, Seen any good movies lately?,38
23922,JERRY," No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?",38
23923,JERRY," I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?",38
23924,JERRY," I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it.  I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- ",38
23925,GEORGE, Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? ,38
23926,JERRY," Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!",38
23927,GEORGE, So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?,38
23928,JERRY," Yeah.  And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?",38
23929,GEORGE," Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.",38
23930,GEORGE," Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.",38
23931,KRAMER," ...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden.  This steak is excellent, by the way.",38
23932,KRAMER," Yeah, sure. Please.",38
23933,KRAMER," Yeah.  And, it was a big one.",38
23934,KRAMER," Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.",39
23935,JERRY, What are you talking about?,39
23936,KRAMER," Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?",39
23937,JERRY, Yeah.,39
23938,KRAMER," Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.",39
23939,JERRY," Oh yeah, I know.",39
23940,KRAMER," Well, where is it?",39
23941,JERRY, What's the difference?,39
23942,KRAMER," Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.",39
23943,JERRY," You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?",39
23944,KRAMER, What happened to the car?,39
23945,JERRY," If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?",39
23946,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.",39
23947,JERRY," You have to know, you must know.",39
23948,KRAMER, I must know.,39
23949,JERRY," Well, I'm not telling you.",39
23950,KRAMER," Oh, come on.",39
23951,JERRY, Nope. I don't think so.,39
23952,KRAMER," Well, please?",39
23953,JERRY," Not today, pal.",39
23954,KRAMER," Okay, I beg you.",39
23955,JERRY, Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.,39
23956,KRAMER," Okay, please! Please tell me!",39
23957,JERRY," Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.",39
23958,KRAMER," Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.",39
23959,JERRY, I loaned the car to George.,39
23960,KRAMER," Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?",39
23961,JERRY," George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!",39
23962,KRAMER, Alright.,39
23963,JERRY, Huh?,39
23964,KRAMER," Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?",39
23965,JERRY, Will you stop it already?!,39
23966,KRAMER," You know, why didn't they ask me to go?",39
23967,JERRY, I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!,39
23968,KRAMER," What, they don't like me?",39
23969,JERRY, *I* don't like you!,39
23970,KRAMER," If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.",39
23971,GEORGE, I really think it looks good.,39
23972,ELAINE," Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?",39
23973,GEORGE, All bald people look good in hats.,39
23974,ELAINE," You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.",39
23975,GEORGE, What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.,39
23976,ELAINE," Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?",39
23977,GEORGE," No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.",39
23978,ELAINE, Are you sure you like these sunglasses?,39
23979,KRAMER, Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.,39
23980,JERRY, Why not?,39
23981,KRAMER," Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems.  Oh, is this for the fight?",39
23982,JERRY, Yep.  Starts in thirty-five minutes.,39
23983,KRAMER," Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?",39
23984,JERRY," No, I like Mike.",39
23985,KRAMER," Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.",39
23986,JERRY, Oh yeah? What did you talk about?,39
23987,KRAMER, Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.,39
23988,JERRY, Oh yeah? What did he say?,39
23989,KRAMER," You have to know everything, don't you?",39
23990,JERRY," No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?",39
23991,KRAMER, Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?,39
23992,JERRY," Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.",39
23993,KRAMER, Beg me.,39
23994,JERRY," Please, don't make me beg.",39
23995,KRAMER," No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.",39
23996,JERRY," Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.",39
23997,KRAMER," No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...",39
23998,JERRY, Kramer!,39
23999,KRAMER," Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.",39
24000,JERRY, Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.,39
24001,KRAMER, Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.,39
24002,JERRY," I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!",39
24003,KRAMER, He thinks you're a phony.,39
24004,JERRY, He what?,39
24005,KRAMER," I told you, he thinks you're a phony.",39
24006,JERRY, A phony? He called me a phony?,39
24007,KRAMER, A big phone. A big one.,39
24008,JERRY, Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!,39
24009,KRAMER, You begged me.,39
24010,GEORGE, Do you hear that?,39
24011,ELAINE, Of course I hear that.,39
24012,GEORGE, You had to move the mirror?,39
24013,ELAINE, I wanted to check out my sunglasses.,39
24014,GEORGE," I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.",39
24015,ELAINE," Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.",39
24016,GEORGE, I can't drive?,39
24017,ELAINE, Yeah.,39
24018,GEORGE," Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.",39
24019,ELAINE," No, I really don't.",39
24020,GEORGE, And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.,39
24021,ELAINE, I'm sure you could.,39
24022,GEORGE, What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?,39
24023,ELAINE, I don't know.,39
24024,GEORGE," Alright, start looking for spaces.",39
24025,ELAINE," Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.",39
24026,GEORGE," Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.",39
24027,ELAINE," Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.",39
24028,GEORGE, I can't park in a garage.,39
24029,ELAINE, Why?,39
24030,GEORGE," I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.",39
24031,ELAINE, I'll pay for it.,39
24032,GEORGE," You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free?  What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.",39
24033,ELAINE,"  Oh George, there's a space right there!",39
24034,GEORGE,"  Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?",39
24035,ELAINE, You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.,39
24036,GEORGE," Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking.  How I wish you could make a living parallel parking.  It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.",39
24037,ELAINE, Will you just park it already?,39
24038,GEORGE," There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on.  Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!",39
24039,ELAINE," George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.",39
24040,GEORGE," No no no, he's not getting away with this.",39
24041,ELAINE, George?,39
24042,GEORGE," Hey, what are you doing?",39
24043,GEORGE," You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.",39
24044,GEORGE," Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?",39
24045,GEORGE, I was in the middle of a conversation.,39
24046,GEORGE, The point is I was here first.,39
24047,GEORGE, But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!,39
24048,GEORGE, Are you gonna move the car?,39
24049,GEORGE, Jerk!,39
24050,GEORGE, Do you believe this guy?,39
24051,ELAINE," Come on, we'll put it in a garage.",39
24052,GEORGE," I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.",39
24053,ELAINE," What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.",39
24054,GEORGE, Are you coming back down?,39
24055,ELAINE," Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.",39
24056,GEORGE," Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?",39
24057,ELAINE," Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.",39
24058,GEORGE," Oh, come on, you're good at this.",39
24059,ELAINE, What am I gonna say?,39
24060,GEORGE," I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.",39
24061,ELAINE," Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?",39
24062,JERRY," Yeah, under the counter. What happened?",39
24063,ELAINE," Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home.  You wouldn't believe it. ",39
24064,JERRY,  Tell me what happened.,39
24065,ELAINE,"  Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.",39
24066,JERRY, He is?,39
24067,ELAINE," Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.",39
24068,JERRY, A gun?!,39
24069,ELAINE," I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.",39
24070,JERRY," My god, are you okay?",39
24071,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.",39
24072,JERRY," Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.",39
24073,ELAINE, Exactly.,39
24074,JERRY, Where's George now?,39
24075,ELAINE," Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.",39
24076,JERRY, What are you talking about?,39
24077,ELAINE," Look out the window, you'll see.",39
24078,JERRY,  Hey Georgie!,39
24079,GEORGE, Hey!,39
24080,JERRY, Are you okay?,39
24081,GEORGE," Yeah, I'm fine.",39
24082,JERRY," Crazy kids, huh?",39
24083,GEORGE, What?,39
24084,ELAINE,  Ow!!  It's my cuticle.,39
24085,JERRY," Oh, hey Mike.",39
24086,GEORGE," What, you know Jerry?",39
24087,GEORGE, How do you know him?,39
24088,GEORGE," Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.",39
24089,JERRY, I'm coming down.,39
24090,GEORGE," What, you know Kramer?!",39
24091,ELAINE, Hi.,39
24092,KRAMER,  Hello.,39
24093,JERRY," Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.",39
24094,KRAMER,"  Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!",39
24095,GEORGE, And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?,39
24096,GEORGE, Oh great.,39
24097,ELAINE, You know that guy downstairs?,39
24098,JERRY," Yeah, he's a real phony.",39
24099,KRAMER, What's going on?!,39
24100,GEORGE, It's my space!,39
24101,KRAMER, I'll be down in a minute.,39
24102,ELAINE, Are you going down?,39
24103,KRAMER, Yeah.,39
24104,ELAINE, Is anything wrong?,39
24105,KRAMER,  Why should anything be wrong?,39
24106,ELAINE,  Be down in a minute.,39
24107,GEORGE, I'll die out here.,39
24108,JERRY, Hi Mike.  Indiana.,39
24109,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, I know him.",39
24110,JERRY," Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.",39
24111,GEORGE," Oh, come on.",39
24112,GEORGE," Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?",39
24113,GEORGE, You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!,39
24114,GEORGE, You've got a prayer.,39
24115,KRAMER, I go in front first all the time.,39
24116,JERRY," Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.",39
24117,GEORGE, Did you talk to him?,39
24118,ELAINE," Yeah, it's all taken care of.",39
24119,GEORGE, You told him? What did you tell him?,39
24120,ELAINE," I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.",39
24121,GEORGE," I don't believe it, what did you say?",39
24122,ELAINE, I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.,39
24123,GEORGE, A pack of teenagers?,39
24124,ELAINE," Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.",39
24125,GEORGE," You are a genius, it's as simple as that.",39
24126,ELAINE," What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.",39
24127,KRAMER," By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.",39
24128,ELAINE, What?,39
24129,KRAMER," Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.",39
24130,GEORGE, Oh great.,39
24131,JERRY, I didn't know.,39
24132,ELAINE," Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.",39
24133,GEORGE, Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.,39
24134,GEORGE," Hey, who's talking to you?",39
24135,ELAINE, We just didn't think of you.,39
24136,KRAMER," You said it, sister.",39
24137,GEORGE, What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?,39
24138,GEORGE," Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.",39
24139,JERRY, I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!,39
24140,GEORGE," Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.",39
24141,JERRY, You're right. My fault.,39
24142,ELAINE," Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.",39
24143,GEORGE," Yeah, I'm sorry.",39
24144,KRAMER," I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.",39
24145,GEORGE," What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?",39
24146,JERRY, It was a so-so sorry.,39
24147,GEORGE, You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.,39
24148,ELAINE," You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.",39
24149,JERRY," Wild pack of teenagers, huh?",39
24150,GEORGE, Yeah.,39
24151,JERRY," Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.",39
24152,ELAINE," Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?",39
24153,GEORGE, Uh huh.,39
24154,JERRY," Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,",39
24155,GEORGE," Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.",39
24156,ELAINE, Right.,39
24157,GEORGE, I learned a lot about myself.,39
24158,JERRY, What did you do to my car?!,39
24159,GEORGE," I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.",39
24160,ELAINE," Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.",39
24161,JERRY, I thought you said you were a good driver!,39
24162,GEORGE," No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.",39
24163,JERRY, I think you said driver.,39
24164,GEORGE," Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.",39
24165,GEORGE," No no no, that's in the right position.",39
24166,GEORGE," No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.",39
24167,GEORGE, Do you?,39
24168,JERRY, Hey Sid.,39
24169,GEORGE," Sid, it's completely his fault.",39
24170,JERRY," Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.",39
24171,GEORGE, Don't do it!,39
24172,JERRY," What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?",39
24173,GEORGE," Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.",39
24174,ELAINE, Why don't you just flip a coin already?,39
24175,GEORGE," No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.",39
24176,ELAINE," You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.",39
24177,GEORGE, So you're against me now?,39
24178,JERRY, Hey Matthew.,39
24179,JERRY, How ya doing?,39
24180,JERRY," Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.",39
24181,JERRY," Oh no, nothing.",39
24182,JERRY," No, no, no, no.",39
24183,JERRY," No, of course not, of course not!",39
24184,JERRY, I didn't--,39
24185,KRAMER," Oh, congratulations.",39
24186,KRAMER," Well, you're pregnant.",39
24187,KRAMER, You're not pregnant?,39
24188,KRAMER, Are you sure you're not pregnant?,39
24189,KRAMER, That's weird.,39
24190,KRAMER, I thought she was pregnant.,39
24191,JERRY,"  Hey, do you think I'm phony?",39
24192,ELAINE, What?,39
24193,JERRY, Mike thinks I'm a phony.,39
24194,ELAINE, He thinks you're a phony?,39
24195,JERRY," Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.",39
24196,ELAINE," Oh, you have to say something.",39
24197,JERRY," I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.",39
24198,ELAINE, You gotta open the vault.,39
24199,JERRY, Open my vault?,39
24200,ELAINE, Open your vault.,39
24201,JERRY," Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.",39
24202,ELAINE, You have no choice.,39
24203,JERRY, Oy ga-vault.,39
24204,KRAMER, When can you park head first?,39
24205,GEORGE, He's right. never.,39
24206,GEORGE, When do you ever have ten car lengths?,39
24207,KRAMER, What about Sundays and holidays?,39
24208,GEORGE, Oh please.,39
24209,GEORGE," Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.",39
24210,GEORGE," Well, thank you for your support.",39
24211,GEORGE, Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.,39
24212,GEORGE," Yeah, thanks.",39
24213,GEORGE," No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.",39
24214,GEORGE," No! Get out of here, Newman.",39
24215,GEORGE," No, Newman, stop it.",39
24216,GEORGE, I don't want him to!,39
24217,GEORGE," You wanna see?!  There! There it is!  Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!",39
24218,GEORGE," Alright, just keep the hat!",39
24219,JERRY," Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?",39
24220,ELAINE, It depends on who's going.  Are you going?,39
24221,KRAMER, I'm not going if he's going.,39
24222,GEORGE, I'm not going if he's going.,39
24223,JERRY, Well if he's going then I'm not going.,39
24224,JERRY, I still don't have to go.,39
24225,ELAINE, Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.,39
24226,JERRY, Why? I'll tell you why.,39
24227,KRAMER," No. Don't, Jerry.",39
24228,JERRY, Like you didn't call me a phony?,39
24229,JERRY, Use it in a sentence.,39
24230,KRAMER, He begged me.,39
24231,JERRY," Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?",39
24232,GEORGE," Officer, could I just explain something to you?",39
24233,GEORGE," Officer, he can't pull in head first.",39
24234,GEORGE," Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!",39
24235,GEORGE, I don't have a job!,39
24236,JERRY," Kramer, what are you doing here!?",40
24237,KRAMER," Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"" and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.",40
24238,JERRY, You scared me!,40
24239,KRAMER, It's just me.,40
24240,JERRY, That's enough!,40
24241,KRAMER, Forgot the popper... ,40
24242,JERRY, Kramer! What are you doing?!,40
24243,KRAMER, What does it look like I'm doing? What?,40
24244,JERRY," Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!",40
24245,KRAMER," Alright, alright...",40
24246,JERRY, C'mon!,40
24247,KRAMER, Sorry.,40
24248,JERRY, Move it! Move it! Get going!,40
24249,KRAMER, My drain's all clogged up! ,40
24250,JERRY," Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?",40
24251,JERRY, Oh. I see. There he is! ,40
24252,JERRY, The murderers! ,40
24253,JERRY, Did you see the look on that guy's face?,40
24254,JERRY, Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!,40
24255,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.",40
24256,JERRY," All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.",40
24257,KRAMER, What?,40
24258,JERRY," What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.",40
24259,KRAMER," Oh, come on!",40
24260,JERRY," No, come on!",40
24261,KRAMER," What, what, I thought you went to the movies!",40
24262,JERRY, It was sold out!,40
24263,KRAMER, Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?,40
24264,JERRY, That's the point.,40
24265,KRAMER, What point?,40
24266,JERRY," Just, look, just give the keys.",40
24267,KRAMER, Just give me another chance!,40
24268,JERRY, Don't ask me!,40
24269,KRAMER, I'm asking you!,40
24270,JERRY, I'm telling you.,40
24271,KRAMER, You're joking.,40
24272,JERRY, I'm serious!,40
24273,KRAMER, It's not going to happen again!,40
24274,JERRY," Yes it will, now give me those keys!",40
24275,JERRY, So put 'em in a safe place.,40
24276,ELAINE, I will.,40
24277,JERRY, Where?,40
24278,ELAINE," I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?",40
24279,JERRY," I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.",40
24280,ELAINE," Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.",40
24281,JERRY, I can't.,40
24282,JERRY, Who's there?,40
24283,ELAINE," Oh, I'm not, uh...",40
24284,KRAMER," No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke ""the covenant of the keys.""",40
24285,ELAINE," Jerry, give him the keys back.",40
24286,JERRY, Elaine...,40
24287,KRAMER," I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float.  And I thank you.",40
24288,JERRY, Take the keys.,40
24289,KRAMER, I don't want the keys! ,40
24290,JERRY, O.K.!,40
24291,KRAMER," Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.",40
24292,JERRY, Your spare set?,40
24293,KRAMER, That's right.,40
24294,JERRY, You want 'em back?,40
24295,KRAMER," Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.",40
24296,GEORGE," Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.",40
24297,KRAMER," Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!",40
24298,GEORGE," Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.",40
24299,KRAMER," Well, you can get 'em back.",40
24300,GEORGE, I suppose I could.,40
24301,KRAMER," Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.",40
24302,GEORGE, Me?,40
24303,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.",40
24304,GEORGE," Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. ",40
24305,GEORGE, Yearn? Do I yearn?,40
24306,KRAMER, I yearn.,40
24307,GEORGE, You yearn.,40
24308,KRAMER," Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?",40
24309,GEORGE," Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.",40
24310,GEORGE," Aw, Kramer, don't start...",40
24311,GEORGE," I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!",40
24312,KRAMER," O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?",40
24313,GEORGE, No.,40
24314,KRAMER, You got money?,40
24315,GEORGE, No.,40
24316,KRAMER, Do you have a woman?,40
24317,GEORGE, No.,40
24318,KRAMER, Do you have any prospects?,40
24319,GEORGE, No.,40
24320,KRAMER, You got anything on the horizon?,40
24321,GEORGE, Uh...no.,40
24322,KRAMER, Do you have any action at all?,40
24323,GEORGE, No.,40
24324,KRAMER, Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?,40
24325,GEORGE, I like to get the Daily News!,40
24326,KRAMER," George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.",40
24327,GEORGE, Why?,40
24328,KRAMER," I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.",40
24329,GEORGE," Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.",40
24330,KRAMER," No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.",40
24331,GEORGE," ""These pretzels are making me thirsty""? That was one line! You got fired!",40
24332,KRAMER," I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?",40
24333,GEORGE," Uh, no, I'm not.",40
24334,KRAMER," Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. ",40
24335,GEORGE," You're not really gonna go to California, are you?",40
24336,GEORGE," Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.",40
24337,ELAINE, Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?,40
24338,GEORGE," I don't know. He said he wants to be my ""key brother.""",40
24339,ELAINE, That's ridiculous.,40
24340,ELAINE, I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.,40
24341,GEORGE, What for?,40
24342,ELAINE, 'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.,40
24343,GEORGE, Jerry? Why?,40
24344,ELAINE, 'Cause he gave me his.,40
24345,GEORGE, So what?,40
24346,ELAINE," So, if he has my keys, I should have his.",40
24347,GEORGE," Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.",40
24348,ELAINE, I just said the same thing to you.,40
24349,GEORGE, What?,40
24350,ELAINE, What?,40
24351,GEORGE," Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?",40
24352,ELAINE," Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em.  What are you doing? Would you just put that down?  I gotta get some new friends.",40
24353,JERRY, Did you bring the keys?,40
24354,GEORGE," Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.",40
24355,JERRY, This could be an emergency!,40
24356,GEORGE, You never should have taken away his keys!,40
24357,JERRY," I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. ",40
24358,GEORGE, How'd the Mets do?,40
24359,JERRY, They lost.,40
24360,JERRY, Kramer?,40
24361,JERRY," Hello, Newman.",40
24362,JERRY," Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!",40
24363,GEORGE," Yeah, coy.",40
24364,JERRY," You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?",40
24365,JERRY," Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!",40
24366,JERRY," Turn around, George.",40
24367,GEORGE, Sure. ,40
24368,JERRY," Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? ",40
24369,JERRY, Where's Kramer?,40
24370,ELAINE, What's going on?,40
24371,GEORGE, No we're not.,40
24372,JERRY, We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.,40
24373,JERRY, Bad rap?,40
24374,JERRY, Me?,40
24375,JERRY, L.A.?,40
24376,JERRY," I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?",40
24377,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, I saw it.  I mean, it's complete bullshit.",40
24378,JERRY, Huh?,40
24379,ELAINE, What...?,40
24380,JERRY," No, what'd you say?",40
24381,ELAINE, Nothing. I didn't say anything.,40
24382,JERRY," Oh, you didn't see it.",40
24383,ELAINE," Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.",40
24384,JERRY," I heard you say something, there.",40
24385,ELAINE, I didn't say anything.,40
24386,JERRY," I'm calling Kramer's mother.   I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!",40
24387,GEORGE, Ask her about Kramer.,40
24388,JERRY, She's drunk out of her mind.,40
24389,GEORGE," Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.",40
24390,JERRY, Don't feel right? What are you talking about?,40
24391,GEORGE," Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?",40
24392,JERRY, What is the big deal?,40
24393,GEORGE," Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.",40
24394,JERRY," First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.",40
24395,GEORGE," Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.",40
24396,JERRY," Well, I want those keys. ",40
24397,GEORGE," Nope, no can do.",40
24398,JERRY," George, give them to me, I want these keys.  I don't want to get physical!",40
24399,GEORGE, Do you wanna fight?,40
24400,JERRY, Do you wanna fight?,40
24401,GEORGE, I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! ,40
24402,KRAMER," And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.",40
24403,KRAMER," Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.",40
24404,KRAMER," Oh, he's cold.",40
24405,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny.  Hey, you can drop me here!",40
24406,KRAMER," Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.",40
24407,KRAMER," What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? ",40
24408,JERRY," Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.",40
24409,GEORGE," You're right, how did I miss that?  Maybe because it's a crock of shit.",40
24410,JERRY, What's that?,40
24411,GEORGE, Nothing.,40
24412,JERRY, I heard something.,40
24413,GEORGE, Didn't say anything. ,40
24414,KRAMER," So, how long you been drivin' this thing?",40
24415,KRAMER," Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.",40
24416,KRAMER," You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.",40
24417,KRAMER, Really?,40
24418,KRAMER, Yeah.,40
24419,GEORGE," They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!",40
24420,JERRY," Well, this is great.",40
24421,GEORGE," Well, what do they look like?",40
24422,JERRY," They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys.  ""What do they look like.""",40
24423,GEORGE," Well, they're obviously not here.",40
24424,JERRY," Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.",40
24425,GEORGE," Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!",40
24426,GEORGE, What?,40
24427,JERRY, By Elaine Benes?,40
24428,GEORGE, What?,40
24429,JERRY," Elaine's writing a ""Murphy Brown""?",40
24430,GEORGE, Lemme see this. ,40
24431,JERRY, Wait a second! ,40
24432,GEORGE, Gimme half!,40
24433,JERRY," All right, here!",40
24434,GEORGE, Why didn't she tell us?,40
24435,ELAINE, You weasels!,40
24436,JERRY, What? What?,40
24437,ELAINE, How dare you!,40
24438,GEORGE, We hardly read anything!,40
24439,JERRY, It was funny!,40
24440,ELAINE, Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?,40
24441,JERRY, Well...  From what I saw...,40
24442,JERRY," I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.",40
24443,GEORGE, He forced me to!,40
24444,JERRY, I did not!,40
24445,GEORGE, Yes you did!,40
24446,ELAINE, You! Get out! Get out! Get out!,40
24447,JERRY," Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!",40
24448,ELAINE," Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!",40
24449,JERRY, Good!,40
24450,GEORGE," What, you don't want me to hold your keys?",40
24451,ELAINE," No, you can't be trusted!",40
24452,GEORGE," Alright, alright, fine. ",40
24453,ELAINE, Good! I won't!,40
24454,JERRY, Good! Don't! Are these my keys?,40
24455,ELAINE, These aren't my keys!,40
24456,GEORGE, Whose are these?,40
24457,ELAINE, I don't know!,40
24458,ELAINE, I just thought I could write it.,40
24459,JERRY, Is that something you want to do?,40
24460,ELAINE, I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.,40
24461,JERRY," Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a ""Murphy Brown."" You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.",40
24462,ELAINE," O.K., can I just watch the show?  God, what an asshole.",40
24463,JERRY, What did you say?,40
24464,ELAINE, I didn't say anything.,40
24465,JERRY," I heard something.  Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on ""Murphy Brown""!",40
24466,JERRY," Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!",40
24467,KRAMER," Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.",40
24468,KRAMER," Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.",40
24469,KRAMER, Steven.,40
24470,KRAMER, Oh - I'm familiar with it.,40
24471,GEORGE, Kramer was on Murphy Brown?,41
24472,JERRY, Yeah.,41
24473,GEORGE, Are you sure?,41
24474,JERRY, Yeah.,41
24475,GEORGE," Murphy Brown, the TV show.",41
24476,JERRY," C'mon, will ya?",41
24477,GEORGE, Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!,41
24478,JERRY," Something, isn't it?",41
24479,GEORGE, With Candace Bergen!,41
24480,JERRY, I know!,41
24481,GEORGE, I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?,41
24482,JERRY, Sure.,41
24483,GEORGE, Did she show her breasts in that?,41
24484,JERRY, She's not really the naked type.,41
24485,GEORGE, I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.,41
24486,JERRY, He did?,41
24487,GEORGE," Yeah, I turned him down.",41
24488,JERRY, How come you didn't tell me?,41
24489,GEORGE, He asked me to keep it a secret.,41
24490,JERRY, But you can never keep a secret.,41
24491,GEORGE, I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.,41
24492,JERRY," Well, you've come a long way.",41
24493,GEORGE, I've matured.,41
24494,JERRY," Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?",41
24495,GEORGE, A free ticket?,41
24496,JERRY," Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.",41
24497,GEORGE, What about accommodations?,41
24498,JERRY, All taken care of.,41
24499,GEORGE," Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...",41
24500,KRAMER," So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.",41
24501,KRAMER," Uh, did you?",41
24502,KRAMER," Well, I was just--",41
24503,KRAMER," Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?",41
24504,KRAMER," Uh, yeah, uh, Candace Bergen please.",41
24505,KRAMER," Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer.",41
24506,KRAMER," Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home.  Go ahead, it's all yours.",41
24507,KRAMER," Oh, uh, Helena, how are you?",41
24508,KRAMER," Well, that's only uh, 58 years.",41
24509,KRAMER," Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?",41
24510,KRAMER," Uh huh, right.",41
24511,KRAMER, Right.,41
24512,KRAMER, Uh huh.,41
24513,KRAMER, Right.,41
24514,KRAMER, Really.,41
24515,KRAMER, Really?,41
24516,KRAMER, Well I don't remember that part.,41
24517,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.",41
24518,KRAMER," Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.",41
24519,KRAMER," Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?",41
24520,KRAMER," Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.",41
24521,JERRY, What is this?,41
24522,GEORGE, What?,41
24523,JERRY," We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?",41
24524,GEORGE, I happen to dress based on mood.,41
24525,JERRY, Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.,41
24526,GEORGE," Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.",41
24527,JERRY, And what mood is this.,41
24528,GEORGE, This is Morning Mist.,41
24529,JERRY," Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.",41
24530,GEORGE, Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.,41
24531,JERRY, Just go.,41
24532,GEORGE," Heh he, I made it.",41
24533,JERRY, Anklets?,41
24534,JERRY, Really?,41
24535,GEORGE, My bag?,41
24536,JERRY, Over here?,41
24537,GEORGE, A knife?,41
24538,GEORGE, Moisturizer?,41
24539,GEORGE," No, I uh... I use it.",41
24540,JERRY,"  Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.",41
24541,JERRY, That's it?,41
24542,JERRY, Alright.,41
24543,GEORGE," C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?",41
24544,JERRY, I must have iron rich blood.,41
24545,GEORGE," Here we go, LA.",41
24546,JERRY," The Coast,",41
24547,GEORGE," La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?",41
24548,JERRY, Who said that?,41
24549,GEORGE, I called it.,41
24550,JERRY, Oh no.,41
24551,GEORGE," What do you mean, oh no.",41
24552,KRAMER," Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition.",41
24553,KRAMER," Uh, let's see... well.",41
24554,KRAMER, You scream good.,41
24555,KRAMER," Oh yeah, yeah, I got 20 copies.",41
24556,KRAMER, Really.,41
24557,KRAMER, Um-hm.,41
24558,KRAMER," Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.",41
24559,KRAMER," He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.",41
24560,KRAMER," Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?",41
24561,KRAMER," Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...",41
24562,KRAMER," Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.",41
24563,KRAMER," Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...",41
24564,KRAMER," Ok, but I got this...",41
24565,KRAMER," Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.",41
24566,KRAMER, I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.,41
24567,KRAMER, So I'd like to give it to you.,41
24568,KRAMER,"  Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.",41
24569,JERRY," Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?",41
24570,GEORGE, Curly.,41
24571,JERRY, Wavy.,41
24572,GEORGE, What'd you ask me for?,41
24573,JERRY," Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?",41
24574,GEORGE, Nope.,41
24575,JERRY," 'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?",41
24576,JERRY," I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?",41
24577,GEORGE," You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body													lotion!",41
24578,JERRY, About 6-3.,41
24579,GEORGE," Ooh, a shower cap!",41
24580,JERRY, Coming.,41
24581,GEORGE," Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?",41
24582,GEORGE," Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?",41
24583,GEORGE, Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.,41
24584,GEORGE," Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.",41
24585,GEORGE," Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?",41
24586,GEORGE," Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?",41
24587,JERRY," Excuse me, what?",41
24588,GEORGE, You want your blankets tucked in?,41
24589,JERRY, What blankets?,41
24590,GEORGE, When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.,41
24591,JERRY," I don't know, whatever they do.",41
24592,JERRY," Tuck in, tuck in.",41
24593,GEORGE," Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.",41
24594,GEORGE," Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.",41
24595,JERRY," Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.",41
24596,JERRY," Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.",41
24597,GEORGE, You just said you weren't tucking.,41
24598,JERRY, I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.,41
24599,GEORGE," Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?",41
24600,JERRY," Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?",41
24601,JERRY," Oh, okay, thanks.",41
24602,GEORGE, Thank you.,41
24603,GEORGE," Alright, Lupe, bye-bye now.",41
24604,GEORGE, Bye-bye.,41
24605,JERRY," I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.",41
24606,GEORGE," Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.",41
24607,JERRY, They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!,41
24608,GEORGE," Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.",41
24609,JERRY," Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.",41
24610,GEORGE," Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?",41
24611,GEORGE, You shouldn't have tucked.,41
24612,JERRY, I like it tucked.,41
24613,GEORGE, Nobody tucks anymore.,41
24614,GEORGE," This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?",41
24615,JERRY, I don't know.,41
24616,GEORGE, Might meet a celebrity.,41
24617,JERRY, I can't believe she threw out my napkin.,41
24618,GEORGE," What are you worried about, you know it.",41
24619,JERRY, You gonna be alright here?,41
24620,GEORGE," Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.",41
24621,JERRY," Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.",41
24622,GEORGE," Go, go, go, don't worry about it.",41
24623,GEORGE, Hey.  Corbin Bernsen.,41
24624,GEORGE, Big fan! Big fan.,41
24625,GEORGE," Hey, you grew a beard, huh?",41
24626,GEORGE," Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.",41
24627,GEORGE," ...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.",41
24628,GEORGE," Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.",41
24629,GEORGE," That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?",41
24630,GEORGE, I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.,41
24631,GEORGE," But really, it's enough with the bar already.",41
24632,GEORGE," Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?",41
24633,GEORGE," Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?",41
24634,GEORGE, What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.,41
24635,GEORGE, Yeah?,41
24636,GEORGE," Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!",41
24637,JERRY, How's it going?,41
24638,GEORGE, Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.,41
24639,JERRY, Really?,41
24640,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!",41
24641,JERRY, You got toilet paper on your heel there.,41
24642,JERRY," So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.",41
24643,JERRY, I was terrible.,41
24644,GEORGE," What are you, crazy? You were fine.",41
24645,JERRY," Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...",41
24646,GEORGE, Conveyor belt.,41
24647,JERRY, Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin.,41
24648,GEORGE," I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?",41
24649,JERRY," Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.",41
24650,GEORGE," He's on the lamb, he's on the loose!",42
24651,JERRY," Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!",42
24652,GEORGE," What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?",42
24653,JERRY, Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.,42
24654,GEORGE, Hope he's not the guy.,42
24655,JERRY, Couldn't be the guy...nah.,42
24656,GEORGE," God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger.",42
24657,JERRY, How can you think of food at the time like this?,42
24658,GEORGE, Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.,42
24659,JERRY," I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!",42
24660,GEORGE," I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.",42
24661,JERRY, You should've had some eggs.,42
24662,GEORGE, For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?,42
24663,JERRY, Have you ever heard of egg salad?,42
24664,GEORGE, Why didn't you say something then?,42
24665,JERRY, I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?,42
24666,GEORGE," I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.",42
24667,JERRY," I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.",42
24668,GEORGE," Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.",42
24669,JERRY, I don't have any change. You've got any change?,42
24670,GEORGE," No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.",42
24671,JERRY," Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.",42
24672,GEORGE, I have a ten.,42
24673,JERRY," So, break it.",42
24674,GEORGE, I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.,42
24675,JERRY," So, buy something.",42
24676,GEORGE, What?,42
24677,JERRY," I don't know, some mints or TicTacs.",42
24678,GEORGE, Breath problem?,42
24679,JERRY," No, I just want some change.",42
24680,GEORGE, Tell me.,42
24681,JERRY," Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.",42
24682,GEORGE," You know, I haven't eaten anything.",42
24683,JERRY, I just wanna call the police!,42
24684,GEORGE, Why don't you just call 911?,42
24685,JERRY, But is this an emergency?,42
24686,GEORGE, Of course it is.,42
24687,JERRY, How is this an emergency?,42
24688,GEORGE, Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.,42
24689,JERRY," All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...",42
24690,GEORGE, What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!,42
24691,JERRY," Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?",42
24692,GEORGE," What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?",42
24693,JERRY," Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.",42
24694,GEORGE, Really?,42
24695,JERRY, Sure.,42
24696,GEORGE, You think so?,42
24697,JERRY," Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler.  would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?",42
24698,GEORGE, I don't know.,42
24699,JERRY," We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.",42
24700,GEORGE," Excuse me, where are we?",42
24701,JERRY," Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.",42
24702,GEORGE, Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?,42
24703,GEORGE, You don't know?,42
24704,GEORGE, How come you don't know what street are you on?,42
24705,JERRY," George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is?  No...do we know where 170 is?  No...do we know where 134 is?  No. Aha, ok.  He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.",42
24706,GEORGE, Black and white?,42
24707,JERRY, A cop car.,42
24708,GEORGE, Why didn't you just say that?,42
24709,JERRY, I thought it sounded kind of cool.,42
24710,GEORGE," Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.",42
24711,JERRY," Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.",42
24712,GEORGE," I'll bet you, how much?",42
24713,JERRY, Her tip.,42
24714,GEORGE, You've got a bet.,42
24715,JERRY, Ok.,42
24716,GEORGE, How much do you tip a chamber maid?,42
24717,GEORGE," Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or...",42
24718,GEORGE," Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.",42
24719,JERRY," Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.",42
24720,GEORGE, He started it.,42

24722,JERRY, But you could?,42
24723,GEORGE, You guys ever shot anybody?,42
24724,GEORGE," Hey, can I flip on the siren?",42
24725,JERRY, Why are you bothering them for?,42
24726,GEORGE," I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.",42
24727,GEORGE," Wohoo, check it out.",42
24728,JERRY, Can I try it?,42
24729,JERRY, Scared the hell out of that guy.,42
24730,GEORGE," You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always ""waaaa, waaaa"", you know now it ""woo-woo-woo-woo-woo"". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?",42
24731,JERRY," Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...",42
24732,KRAMER, I'm dizzy.,42
24733,JERRY, Nice shotgun.,42
24734,JERRY, Clean as a whistle.,42
24735,GEORGE, You could eat of that shotgun.,42
24736,JERRY," What is that, a 12 gauge?",42
24737,JERRY, 12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge.,42
24738,GEORGE, My favorite.,42
24739,JERRY," Mine too, love the 12 gauge.",42
24740,GEORGE, Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.,42
24741,JERRY, 5-19? What's a 5-19?,42
24742,GEORGE, Where?,42
24743,JERRY, I can't believe this. A 5-19?,42
24744,GEORGE," Where, where? I can't see.",42
24745,JERRY, Pull over? You can't pull over.,42
24746,GEORGE, What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?,42
24747,JERRY, Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.,42
24748,GEORGE," Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here.",42
24749,JERRY, We have an appointment!,42
24750,GEORGE, What are you doing?!,42
24751,JERRY, Great.,42
24752,GEORGE, There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.,42
24753,JERRY, Which flavor?,42
24754,GEORGE, Milano.,42
24755,JERRY, Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?,42
24756,GEORGE, Should I take some?,42
24757,JERRY, I think that's a 5-19.,42
24758,GEORGE, I'm starving...,42
24759,JERRY, They're busting this guy.,42
24760,GEORGE, They're cuffing him.,42
24761,JERRY, I can't believe this.,42
24762,GEORGE, Hi.,42
24763,JERRY," Hi, I'm Jerry.",42
24764,GEORGE," George, how you doing?",42
24765,GEORGE, Nothing.,42
24766,JERRY, Nothing.,42
24767,JERRY, Hot out.,42
24768,GEORGE, What do you tip a chamber maid.,42
24769,JERRY," No, a dollar, two tops.",42
24770,GEORGE, Narks?,42
24771,JERRY," Imagine, us narks?",42
24772,GEORGE," No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer.",42
24773,GEORGE," Oh, thank you.",42
24774,JERRY," Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.",42
24775,GEORGE," Yeah well, we don't think.",42
24776,JERRY, We're pretty sure.,42
24777,JERRY," Yeah, that's a good tip!",42
24778,JERRY, I read it in Ann Landers.,42
24779,JERRY, Kramer.,42
24780,JERRY, I wanna see what's happening.,42
24781,GEORGE, I don't know why I'm doing this.,42
24782,KRAMER," Jerry, George!",42
24783,KRAMER, I don't know...,42
24784,KRAMER," Hey, how are you doing? Jerry! George!",42
24785,JERRY, We're doing fine. How are you?,42
24786,KRAMER," What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player.",42
24787,GEORGE, A player?,42
24788,KRAMER," Yeah, a player...",42
24789,JERRY," Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?",42
24790,KRAMER," What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together.",42
24791,JERRY," Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!",42
24792,KRAMER," So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?",42
24793,JERRY," Well, yeah...sure.",42
24794,KRAMER," Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?",42
24795,KRAMER, Help me!! Help me!,42
24796,KRAMER," I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!",42
24797,KRAMER, You're making a big mistake.,42
24798,KRAMER, What?,42
24799,KRAMER," Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!",42
24800,KRAMER," Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...",42
24801,KRAMER, No...,42
24802,KRAMER," Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?",42
24803,KRAMER, Hahaa!,42
24804,GEORGE, What?,42
24805,JERRY, What happened?,42
24806,KRAMER, Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.,42
24807,JERRY, Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!,42
24808,GEORGE, You're kidding? Somebody else got killed?,42
24809,JERRY, While you were in jail. So you're free.,42
24810,KRAMER," Yes, I'm free.  'cause the murderer struck again!",42
24811,JERRY," So Kramer, what are you going to do?",42
24812,KRAMER," Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.",42
24813,GEORGE," Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?",42
24814,KRAMER," What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?",42
24815,GEORGE, I'd like to hear that.,42
24816,JERRY, Yeah...,42
24817,KRAMER," Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...",42
24818,JERRY," Kramer, she was murdered!",42
24819,KRAMER," Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.",42
24820,GEORGE, As a suspect in a serial killing.,42
24821,KRAMER," Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.",42
24822,GEORGE," What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.",42
24823,JERRY, So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?,42
24824,KRAMER," No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.",42
24825,GEORGE," Taste this, is this a dill?",42
24826,JERRY," No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.",42
24827,KRAMER," Ok, it's forgotten.",42
24828,GEORGE," Tarragon? Oh, you're crazy.",42
24829,JERRY," Well, take it easy.",42
24830,KRAMER," Yeah, ok.",42
24831,GEORGE," Yeah, take care. Stay in touch.",42
24832,KRAMER," Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...",42
24833,JERRY," Oh, no...",42
24834,GEORGE," No, you're crushing my sandwich.",42
24835,JERRY," Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.",42
24836,GEORGE, Mint?,42
24837,JERRY, No thanks.,42
24838,GEORGE," I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.",42
24839,JERRY," It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.",42
24840,GEORGE, Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?,42
24841,JERRY," No, I don't.",42
24842,GEORGE," You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.",42
24843,JERRY," Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.",42
24844,GEORGE," I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.",42
24845,JERRY, How much did you wound up tipping her?,42
24846,GEORGE," Oh my God, I forgot!",42
24847,JERRY," Well, communism didn't work.",42
24848,KRAMER, Hey!,42
24849,KRAMER, Any mustard? This is empty.,42
24850,JERRY," Yeah, there's a new one in there.",42
24851,KRAMER," No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?",42
24852,JERRY, Help yourself.,42
24853,KRAMER," Yeah, all right.",42
24854,GEORGE," Kramer, what are you doing here?",42
24855,KRAMER, Getting something to eat.,42
24856,JERRY," Kramer, here!",42
24857,GEORGE, What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?,43
24858,JERRY, What?,43
24859,GEORGE, I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?,43
24860,JERRY, Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.,43
24861,GEORGE, What?,43
24862,JERRY, That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?,43
24863,GEORGE," All right, so what did they do?",43
24864,JERRY, I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.,43
24865,GEORGE, Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.,43
24866,JERRY," Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .",43
24867,JERRY, Hi.,43
24868,JERRY, Sure.,43
24869,JERRY, Hello.,43
24870,GEORGE," Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I?",43
24871,GEORGE, I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.,43
24872,JERRY, George-,43
24873,GEORGE,"  Huh? All right, fine.",43
24874,JERRY, Oh thank you very much.,43
24875,JERRY, Really? Wow.,43
24876,JERRY, I'd be very interested in something like that.,43
24877,JERRY, Okay. Great. Thanks.,43
24878,JERRY, Thank you.,43
24879,JERRY, Nice meeting you.,43
24880,GEORGE, What was that all about?,43
24881,JERRY, They said they were interested in me.,43
24882,GEORGE, For what?,43
24883,JERRY," You know, a TV show.",43
24884,GEORGE, Your own show?,43
24885,JERRY," Yeah, I guess so.",43
24886,GEORGE, They want you to do a TV show?,43
24887,JERRY," Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.",43
24888,GEORGE," Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.",43
24889,JERRY, Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?,43
24890,GEORGE, Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.,43
24891,JERRY, But gymnastics is not for everybody.,43
24892,GEORGE," I know, but he's your son.",43
24893,JERRY, So what?,43
24894,GEORGE," All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.",43
24895,JERRY, Yeah and...?,43
24896,GEORGE, And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.,43
24897,JERRY, What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?,43
24898,GEORGE, Why not?,43
24899,JERRY, So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.,43
24900,GEORGE," I know, but antiques are very popular right now.",43
24901,JERRY," No they're not, they used to be.",43
24902,GEORGE," Oh yeah, like you know.",43
24903,JERRY, Oh like you do.,43
24904,KRAMER, ...And you're the manager of the circus.,43
24905,JERRY, A circus?,43
24906,KRAMER," Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.",43
24907,JERRY, I don't think so.,43
24908,KRAMER," Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.",43
24909,JERRY, I don't think the network will go for it.,43
24910,KRAMER, Why not?,43
24911,JERRY," Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.",43
24912,KRAMER," Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a ""can't miss.""",43
24913,JERRY, Hello Newman.,43
24914,KRAMER, All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? ,43
24915,JERRY," Yeah, sure.",43
24916,JERRY, What's this all about?,43
24917,JERRY, I didn't know you had a motorctcle.,43
24918,JERRY, You have a girlfriend?,43
24919,JERRY, I never remember you with a girl.,43
24920,JERRY, This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.,43
24921,JERRY, All right.,43
24922,JERRY, You know you're getting gypped over here.,43
24923,KRAMER," Really, Ah,",43
24924,KRAMER," Oh, stop saying 'reneging"".",43
24925,KRAMER," I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.",43
24926,KRAMER, You let go - come on ...,43
24927,JERRY, Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!,43
24928,JERRY, Does that thing work?,43
24929,KRAMER, Nah.,43
24930,JERRY, ... I just got a postcard from Elaine?,43
24931,GEORGE, Really?,43
24932,JERRY," Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.",43
24933,GEORGE, I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.,43
24934,GEORGE," So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?",43
24935,JERRY," No, nothing.",43
24936,GEORGE, Why don't they have salsa on the table?,43
24937,JERRY, What do you need salsa for?,43
24938,GEORGE, Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.,43
24939,JERRY," You know why? Because people like to say ""salsa."" ""Excuse me, do you have salsa?"" ""We need more salsa."" ""Where is the salsa? No salsa?""",43
24940,GEORGE," You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa.  ""I wanted seltzer, not salsa.""",43
24941,JERRY," ""Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!""",43
24942,GEORGE," See, this should be a show. This is the show.",43
24943,JERRY, What?,43
24944,GEORGE, This. Just talking.,43
24945,JERRY,"  Yeah, right.",43
24946,GEORGE, I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.,43
24947,JERRY, Just talking? Well what's the show about?,43
24948,GEORGE, It's about nothing.,43
24949,JERRY, No story?,43
24950,GEORGE, No forget the story.,43
24951,JERRY, You've got to have a story.,43
24952,GEORGE," Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.",43
24953,JERRY, And who is on the show? Who are the characters?,43
24954,GEORGE, I could be a character.,43
24955,JERRY, You?,43
24956,GEORGE, Yeah. You could base a character on me.,43
24957,JERRY," So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?",43
24958,GEORGE," Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, ""You know you're a quite a character.""",43
24959,JERRY, And who else is on the show?,43
24960,GEORGE, Elaine could be a character. Kramer..,43
24961,JERRY, Now he's a character.  So everybody I know is a character on the show.,43
24962,GEORGE, Right.,43
24963,JERRY, And it's about nothing?,43
24964,GEORGE, Absolutely nothing.,43
24965,JERRY," So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.",43
24966,GEORGE, We go into NBC.,43
24967,JERRY," ""We""? Since when are you a writer?",43
24968,GEORGE,  Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.,43
24969,JERRY, You want to go with me to NBC?,43
24970,GEORGE, Yeah. I think we really go something here.,43
24971,JERRY, What do we got?,43
24972,GEORGE, An idea.,43
24973,JERRY, What idea?,43
24974,GEORGE, An idea for the show.,43
24975,JERRY, I still don't know what the idea is.,43
24976,GEORGE, It's about nothing.,43
24977,JERRY, Right.,43
24978,GEORGE," Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.",43
24979,JERRY," So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.",43
24980,GEORGE, Exactly.,43
24981,JERRY," They say, ""What's your show about?"" I say, ""Nothing.""",43
24982,GEORGE, There you go.,43
24983,JERRY,  I think you may have something there.,43
24984,JERRY," So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.",43
24985,KRAMER,"  No, I don't think so.",43
24986,JERRY, What do you mean you don't think so?,43
24987,KRAMER, I don't like it.,43
24988,JERRY, I don't understand. What don't you like about it?,43
24989,KRAMER, I don't like the idea of a character based on me.,43
24990,JERRY, Why not?,43
24991,KRAMER, well it just doesn't sit well.,43
24992,JERRY, You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.,43
24993,KRAMER," That's your problem, buddy.",43
24994,JERRY, I don't understand what the big deal is.,43
24995,KRAMER," Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.",43
24996,JERRY, Whatever you want.,43
24997,KRAMER, I get to play Kramer.,43
24998,JERRY, You can't play Kramer.,43
24999,KRAMER, I am Kramer.,43
25000,JERRY, But you can't act.,43
25001,KRAMER, Phew!,43
25002,JERRY," Okay, fine. We'll use Newman.",43
25003,KRAMER, Newman?,43
25004,JERRY, Nothin' What do you want?,43
25005,KRAMER, Yeah. That's strange.,43
25006,KRAMER, That's queer uh?,43
25007,KRAMER," Yeah, you better think again Mojumbo.",43
25008,JERRY, Buyer beware.,43
25009,KRAMER, No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.,43
25010,JERRY, Karma Kramer?,43
25011,JERRY,"  Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa.  What's the matter?",43
25012,GEORGE,  Nothing.,43
25013,JERRY, You sure? You look a little pale.,43
25014,GEORGE," No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.",43
25015,JERRY," What, are you nervous?",43
25016,GEORGE," No, not nervous. I'm good, very good.  I can't do this! Can't do this!",43
25017,JERRY, What?,43
25018,GEORGE, I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.,43
25019,JERRY, This was your idea!,43
25020,GEORGE, What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.,43
25021,JERRY, Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.,43
25022,GEORGE," They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.",43
25023,JERRY, I told you not to come.,43
25024,GEORGE, I need some water. I gotta get some water.,43
25025,JERRY, They'll give us water in there.,43
25026,GEORGE, Really? That's pretty good.,43
25027,JERRY," Oh God, it's Joe Devola.",43
25028,GEORGE, Who?,43
25029,JERRY," This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.",43
25030,JERRY, Oh God he saw me.,43
25031,JERRY, Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING?,43
25032,JERRY," Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.",43
25033,JERRY," Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?",43
25034,JERRY, What are you doing here?,43
25035,JERRY," AH, GOOD FOR YOU.",43
25036,JERRY," Well, ...",43
25037,JERRY," No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.",43
25038,JERRY, Kramer's party.,43
25039,JERRY," No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.",43
25040,JERRY," No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.",43
25041,JERRY, Give my best to Hinckley.,43
25042,GEORGE, What was that?,43
25043,JERRY," I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...",43
25044,GEORGE," Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?",43
25045,JERRY, Relax. Who are they?,43
25046,GEORGE," Yeah, they're not better than me.",43
25047,JERRY, Course not.,43
25048,GEORGE, Who are they?,43
25049,JERRY, They're nobody.,43
25050,GEORGE, What about me?,43
25051,JERRY, What about you?,43
25052,GEORGE, Why them? Why not me?,43
25053,JERRY, Why not you?,43
25054,GEORGE, I'm as good as them.,43
25055,JERRY, Better.,43
25056,GEORGE, You really think so?,43
25057,JERRY, No.,43
25058,GEORGE," The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.",43
25059,JERRY," Yeah, it's one of my favorites.",43
25060,GEORGE,"  Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, ""La Cocina."" ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.",43
25061,JERRY," Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?",43
25062,GEORGE, Pepe.,43
25063,JERRY," Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.",43
25064,GEORGE," No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.",43
25065,JERRY," Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-",43
25066,GEORGE,  May I?,43
25067,JERRY, Go ahead.,43
25068,GEORGE, I think I can sum up the show for you with one word,43
25069,GEORGE,  Nothing.,43
25070,GEORGE, The show is about nothing.,43
25071,JERRY,"  Well, it's not about nothing.",43
25072,GEORGE,"  No, it's about nothing.",43
25073,JERRY," Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.",43
25074,GEORGE, D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?,43
25075,GEORGE," Is it with a ""y""?",43
25076,JERRY," ..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.",43
25077,GEORGE," Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.",43
25078,JERRY," Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.",43
25079,GEORGE," Oh, no. No stories.",43
25080,GEORGE,  What'd you do today?,43
25081,GEORGE, There's a show. That's a show.,43
25082,JERRY," Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.",43
25083,GEORGE," No, no, no. Nothing happens.",43
25084,JERRY," Well, something happens.",43
25085,GEORGE, Because it's on TV.,43
25086,GEORGE," Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it.  Right?",43
25087,JERRY,  How about this,43
25088,JERRY," I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.",43
25089,GEORGE, . . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.,43
25090,JERRY, Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?,43
25091,GEORGE," Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.",43
25092,JERRY, IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!,43
25093,GEORGE," Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.",43
25094,JERRY," Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.",43
25095,GEORGE, Wait a minute let me call Susan.,43
25096,JERRY," No, no this is more important.",43
25097,GEORGE, She might be leaving to work any minute.,43
25098,JERRY," No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.",43
25099,GEORGE, No.,43
25100,ELAINE, What is it?,43
25101,ELAINE, What?,43
25102,ELAINE," Well, come on we're on vacation.",43
25103,JERRY," Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... ",43
25104,KRAMER, Yeah ,43
25105,GEORGE,  It's George.,43
25106,JERRY," And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.",43
25107,KRAMER," Whoa, back up a second.",43
25108,JERRY," Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.",43
25109,KRAMER, Why would you think I would invite him?,43
25110,JERRY," I just a ssumed, ...",43
25111,KRAMER, Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.,43
25112,GEORGE," Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.",43
25113,JERRY, Of course. How are you?,43
25114,GEORGE, And this is Kramer.,43
25115,GEORGE," All right go ahead Susan, tell him.",43
25116,JERRY, Tell me what?,43
25117,JERRY," Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.",43
25118,JERRY," Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.",43
25119,JERRY," Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.",43
25120,JERRY, Well now you know how I feel. ,43
25121,GEORGE," Well, go ahead, tell him.",43
25122,JERRY," Kramer, are you drinking that milk?",43
25123,KRAMER, Yeah.,43
25124,JERRY, What's the expiration date on that?,43
25125,KRAMER, September third.,43
25126,JERRY, The third?,43
25127,GEORGE, and SUSAN,43
25128,KRAMER," Um, Uh, ugh, ...",43
25129,GEORGE, I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.,43
25130,JERRY, I think SHE saw it coming.,43
25131,GEORGE, You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.,43
25132,JERRY, Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.,43
25133,GEORGE," What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.",43
25134,JERRY," Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.",43
25135,GEORGE," Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.",43
25136,JERRY, What happened to you?,43
25137,KRAMER, Devola came after me.,43
25138,JERRY, What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?,43
25139,KRAMER," Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, ""That's what I thin k of your party.""",43
25140,JERRY," Boy, that is some kick.",43
25141,KRAMER," Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.",43
25142,JERRY," Wow, Newman's helmet.",43
25143,GEORGE, Holly.,43
25144,KRAMER, I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.,43
25145,JERRY," Me, why?",43
25146,KRAMER, He doesn't like you.,43
25147,JERRY, What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.,43
25148,KRAMER, Pass the cream.,43
25149,GEORGE, Wait a second. . all right.,43
25150,JERRY,  Where the hell did I put this?,44
25151,KRAMER, What are you looking for?,44
25152,JERRY," The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?",44
25153,KRAMER," No, no, no.",44
25154,JERRY," All right, what is this?",44
25155,KRAMER,  what is what?,44
25156,JERRY," All right, very funny. I get it.",44
25157,KRAMER, You're in a weird mood.,44
25158,JERRY, Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.,44
25159,KRAMER, Fix what?,44
25160,JERRY, Your pants!,44
25161,KRAMER, what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?,44
25162,JERRY, Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?,44
25163,KRAMER," No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?",44
25164,JERRY, Go look at your face in the mirror.,44
25165,KRAMER, Wha-huh-wha-huh...,44
25166,JERRY,  yeah?,44
25167,GEORGE,  It's George.,44
25168,JERRY, Come on up.,44
25169,KRAMER, I don't believe this.,44
25170,JERRY," You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?",44
25171,KRAMER," No, I swear.",44
25172,JERRY, I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.,44
25173,GEORGE,  Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.,44
25174,KRAMER, Me?,44
25175,GEORGE," Yeah, here you go.",44
25176,KRAMER, What's this?,44
25177,GEORGE, A dry-cleaning bill?,44
25178,JERRY, From that woman at NBC?,44
25179,GEORGE, Yeah.,44
25180,KRAMER, A dry-cleaning bill for what?,44
25181,GEORGE, For vomiting on her vest!,44
25182,KRAMER," Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!",44
25183,GEORGE," Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!",44
25184,KRAMER," Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.",44
25185,GEORGE,"  Yeah, your milk.",44
25186,JERRY,  He drank it.,44
25187,KRAMER, I didn't know.,44
25188,JERRY," All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.",44
25189,KRAMER, Yeah.,44
25190,JERRY, How much was it to clean the vest?,44
25191,GEORGE, Eighteen dollars.,44
25192,JERRY, Can you get vomit out of suede?,44
25193,GEORGE, I don't know.,44
25194,KRAMER, Yo-yo Ma!,44
25195,JERRY, What? Yo-yo Ma?,44
25196,KRAMER, What about him?,44
25197,JERRY, You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.,44
25198,GEORGE, What's Yo-yo Ma?,44
25199,JERRY, He's a cellist.  You should see a doctor today.,44
25200,GEORGE," All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.",44
25201,JERRY, I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.,44
25202,GEORGE, I know!,44
25203,JERRY," That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?",44
25204,GEORGE, The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network,44
25205,JERRY," Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!",44
25206,GEORGE," It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.",44
25207,KRAMER, Jeez!,44
25208,GEORGE, Anyway.,44
25209,JERRY,"  What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today.  Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.",44
25210,GEORGE, What?,44
25211,JERRY, NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.,44
25212,GEORGE," They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?",44
25213,JERRY, I don't know about sixty.,44
25214,GEORGE," Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?",44
25215,JERRY," Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?",44
25216,GEORGE, I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.',44
25217,JERRY," Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!",44
25218,GEORGE, Oh!,44
25219,JERRY," You know, I think he wears a piece.",44
25220,GEORGE," Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.",44
25221,JERRY, I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.,44
25222,GEORGE," What, is that the one your parents gave you?",44
25223,JERRY, Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.,44
25224,GEORGE," All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.",44
25225,JERRY, I'll pay for it.,44
25226,GEORGE, It's not the money!,44
25227,JERRY," Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?",44
25228,JERRY, Uncle Leo!,44
25229,JERRY," Hello there, how're you doing?",44
25230,JERRY," Good, good.",44
25231,JERRY," Good, fine.",44
25232,JERRY," Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.",44
25233,JERRY,"  Oh, sure. Danny.",44
25234,JERRY," Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.",44
25235,JERRY,"  I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.",44
25236,JERRY," We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.",44
25237,JERRY,"  Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh.",44
25238,JERRY," I'm sorry, really.",44
25239,JERRY," Sorry, really.",44
25240,KRAMER,  Yeah?,44
25241,KRAMER, For what?,44

25243,KRAMER," I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.",44
25244,KRAMER," Well, I can't!",44
25245,KRAMER, Shut up! I'll get my coat!,44
25246,KRAMER, Don't step on anything.,44
25247,JERRY, You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.,44
25248,GEORGE, I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.,44
25249,JERRY," You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go",44
25250,GEORGE, Look at this.,44
25251,JERRY, Why didn't you shave this morning?,44
25252,GEORGE, 'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.,44
25253,JERRY, Why?,44
25254,GEORGE, Because of the day before. It's a long story.,44
25255,JERRY, Is that Joe Davola?,44
25256,GEORGE, It's not him!,44
25257,JERRY, I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.,44
25258,JERRY, Oh.,44
25259,GEORGE, Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?,44
25260,JERRY," All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.",44
25261,GEORGE, Okay. A little.,44
25262,KRAMER, No.,44
25263,KRAMER, Uhm...,44
25264,KRAMER, I never had an air conditioner.,44
25265,KRAMER," Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?",44
25266,KRAMER," Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.",44
25267,KRAMER, I was never able to become a banker.,44
25268,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.",44
25269,KRAMER, MUST be banker.,44
25270,GEORGE, The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.,44
25271,GEORGE," Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?",44
25272,JERRY, Wouldn't tune in.,44
25273,GEORGE, Would they tune in?,44
25274,JERRY, No tune.,44
25275,GEORGE, The show will be like a heart attack!,44
25276,JERRY, Just a huge massive coronary.,44
25277,GEORGE, Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.,44
25278,JERRY, He couldn't believe it.,44
25279,GEORGE,"  I said, I said",44
25280,GEORGE," Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.",44
25281,JERRY, We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.,44
25282,GEORGE, Yeah!,44
25283,JERRY, Your off-Broadway play.,44
25284,GEORGE," Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.",44
25285,JERRY,"  Hmm, hmm.",44
25286,GEORGE, That's my vow to you.,44
25287,GEORGE, Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.,44
25288,JERRY," Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.",44
25289,KRAMER,  Yo-yo Ma!,44
25290,GEORGE, See?,44
25291,JERRY, Yeah!,44
25292,GEORGE," I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!",44
25293,JERRY," Now, all we gotta do is write it.",44
25294,GEORGE, Yes! How're we gonna do that?,44
25295,JERRY, Thanks.,44
25296,GEORGE," Oh, thank you.",44
25297,JERRY," Thank you, thanks.",44
25298,GEORGE," Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.",44
25299,JERRY, Phone call? Who knows I'm here?,44
25300,GEORGE, When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.,44
25301,GEORGE," Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.",44
25302,GEORGE," No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.",44
25303,GEORGE," Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.",44
25304,GEORGE," All right, great.",44
25305,JERRY, Bye thanks.,44
25306,GEORGE,"  Bye, thanks.  I can't believe she took the money.",44
25307,JERRY, Why?,44
25308,GEORGE, I offered to pay. She should've said no.,44
25309,JERRY," She did, you insisted.",44
25310,GEORGE," Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.",44
25311,JERRY, Nah!,44
25312,GEORGE," How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?",44
25313,JERRY," oh, I d-I don't know. I d---",44
25314,GEORGE," Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.",44
25315,JERRY, Okay.,44
25316,GEORGE,"  All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.",44
25317,GEORGE, Thirteen thousand?,44
25318,JERRY, Thirteen thousand.,44
25319,GEORGE, a piece?,44
25320,JERRY," No, for both!",44
25321,GEORGE, That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.,44
25322,JERRY," Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?",44
25323,GEORGE," Well, he does.",44
25324,JERRY, You're nuts!,44
25325,GEORGE, I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?,44
25326,JERRY, He's somebody.,44
25327,GEORGE, What about me?,44
25328,JERRY, You're nobody.,44
25329,GEORGE, Why him? Why not me?,44
25330,JERRY," He's good, you're not.",44
25331,GEORGE, I'm better than him.,44
25332,JERRY," You're worse, much much worse.  That's Davola!",44
25333,GEORGE,  What? Where? Where?,44
25334,JERRY, Outside! I saw him outside!,44
25335,ELAINE, what is it?,44
25336,ELAINE,  Again?,44
25337,ELAINE," Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.",44
25338,JERRY, Go outside and see if he's still there.,44
25339,GEORGE," I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.",44
25340,JERRY," Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.",44
25341,GEORGE, Tell the cop.,44
25342,JERRY, Good idea.,44
25343,JERRY, Thanks.,44
25344,JERRY,  He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.,44
25345,GEORGE, I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.,44
25346,JERRY,  What are you doing?,44
25347,JERRY," What, are you ordering food now?",44
25348,JERRY, What happened to the muffin?,44
25349,JERRY, All of a sudden you get hungry?,44
25350,JERRY, No! Enjoy your lunch.,44
25351,GEORGE, I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.,44
25352,JERRY, All of a sudden he gets hungry.,44
25353,GEORGE," You know, a muffin can be very filling.",44
25354,JERRY, I know!,44
25355,KRAMER, What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?,44
25356,KRAMER,  I was very upset that day.,44
25357,KRAMER,  Would you let me say it? Let me talk!,44
25358,KRAMER, All right.,44
25359,KRAMER,  I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.,44
25360,KRAMER,"  Uh, yeah.",44
25361,KRAMER, What was the question?,44
25362,KRAMER," Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said",44
25363,KRAMER, I don't know.,44
25364,KRAMER,  Phone call?,44
25365,KRAMER, From who?,44
25366,KRAMER, From you?,44

25373,JERRY," Well, either you see him or you don't.",44
25374,GEORGE, All right. I don't.,44
25375,JERRY,  What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!,44
25376,GEORGE, What's with this guy?,44
25377,JERRY,  Did you just order coffee?,44
25378,JERRY, This is really too much.,44
25379,JERRY," Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.",44
25380,KRAMER, Never said anything about the banking.,44
25381,JERRY, Hey you guys!,44

25393,KRAMER," You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?",44
25394,JERRY, No.,44
25395,GEORGE, What's the difference? The money is not important.,44
25396,JERRY,"  Hey Newman, is that your red car?",44
25397,JERRY, I think you're getting a ticket.,44
25398,KRAMER," Run, run! Go, go, go!",44
25399,KRAMER, I saw the whole thing!,44
25400,JERRY, Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.,44
25401,GEORGE," Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.",44
25402,JERRY," Oh, like you know what you're talking about!",44
25403,GEORGE," No, YOU do!",44

25410,JERRY," Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.",45
25411,JERRY, We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.													 													 ,45
25412,GEORGE," So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.",45
25413,GEORGE," Well, it's . . . much too low.",45
25414,GEORGE," tsh  Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.",45
25415,GEORGE, Standard?,45

25417,GEORGE," You know, the guy from Cheers.",45
25418,GEORGE, I didn't say I was Ted Danson.,45
25419,GEORGE, You tell Russell.,45
25420,GEORGE, Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?,45
25421,GEORGE, Well what would I say in the note?,45
25422,GEORGE," Oh-ohf  yeah, I'm a writer. 													 													 ",45
25423,JERRY," Um, I don't even know?",45
25424,JERRY, Oh uh ...,45

25446,KRAMER," Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.",45
25447,JERRY, Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?,45
25448,JERRY, I didn't know he wasn't invited.,45
25449,JERRY, It was a mistake.,45
25450,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion",45

25610,JERRY, Could we continue this another time.,45
25611,JERRY,"JERRY: It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. ""It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad."" But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, ""I refuse to put any thought into this at all."" Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?",46
25612,JERRY," Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.",46

25617,JERRY, So you ask her out.,46
25618,JERRY, Why not?,46
25619,JERRY, She's pretty. She's not beautiful.,46
25620,JERRY, I think that's a little extreme.,46
25621,GEORGE, He said what?,46
25622,GEORGE," ""The hell with them?""",46
25623,GEORGE,  Oh boy.,46
25624,GEORGE,  He was pretty emphatic?,46
25625,GEORGE, Pounded?,46
25626,GEORGE,"  Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.",46
25627,GEORGE," I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.",46
25628,GEORGE," Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?",46
25629,GEORGE," Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?",46
25630,GEORGE," Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?",46
25631,GEORGE, Gimme the purse!,46
25632,ELAINE," Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?",46
25633,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend.",46
25634,ELAINE, Okay.,46

25636,ELAINE," Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.",46
25637,KRAMER," Alright, how often do we do it?",46
25638,ELAINE," Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?",46
25639,KRAMER," Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.",46
25640,ELAINE," Alright, alright. We do it, uh...  five times a week, okay?",46
25641,KRAMER,"  Oooh, baby. ",46

25644,ELAINE," No, no, but I would like to hear it.",46
25645,KRAMER," No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed.  'Kay, go 'head, do it.",46
25646,ELAINE,"  Alright, okay. You talk to him.",46
25647,KRAMER,  Talk to him.,46

25657,KRAMER," ...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...",46
25658,KRAMER," ...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.",46
25659,ELAINE,  That's perfect!,46
25660,KRAMER," If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.",46
25661,KRAMER," Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... ",46
25662,KRAMER," ...Ah, ye...  Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible...",46

25743,KRAMER,  Oh.,46

25745,JERRY, I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.,46
25746,JERRY, Oh.  Really? You don't seem that desperate.,46
25747,JERRY," Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?",46
25748,JERRY, They eat fish.,46

25753,KRAMER," Well, we talked about a lot of things.",46
25754,JERRY," How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, ""Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!""",46
25755,JERRY," I know, I know.",46
25756,JERRY," I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.",46
25757,JERRY, I woulda taken you to the airport.,46
25758,JERRY, Neither do I.  Yeah?,46
25759,JERRY, Come on up.  It's George.,46
25760,JERRY," Ah, George turned it down.",46

25763,JERRY,"  Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.",46
25764,GEORGE,  Hey.,46
25765,GEORGE," Hey, Mr Seinfeld.  Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?",46
25766,GEORGE, What'd I do?,46
25767,JERRY, What about NBC? Did you hear anything?,46
25768,GEORGE," Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.",46
25769,GEORGE, We got a deal.,46

25774,GEORGE, ...Who's not doing this for the money.,46
25775,JERRY, ...C'mon.,46
25776,GEORGE, You have no idea how refreshing that is.,46
25777,JERRY, So what'd we get?,46
25778,GEORGE,  Eight thousand dollars.,46
25779,JERRY, Beautiful!,46
25780,GEORGE,"  That's uh, for the two of us.",46
25781,JERRY," Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out													for... less money.",46
25782,GEORGE," I was wrong, you were right.",46
25783,JERRY," You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.",46
25784,GEORGE," You're smart, I'm dumb.",46
25785,JERRY," You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.",46
25786,JERRY,  Yeah?,46
25787,JERRY," Alright, we're coming down.",46
25788,JERRY," Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.",46
25789,JERRY, A present.,46
25790,JERRY," C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.",46
25791,JERRY," Ah hah, alright, let's go.",46
25792,JERRY, Okay.,46
25793,GEORGE," Yeah, he's something, isn't he?",46

25796,JERRY," Hey, uncle Leo.",46
25797,JERRY, How you doing?,46
25798,JERRY, This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.,46
25799,JERRY," Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?",46
25800,JERRY," Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.",46
25801,GEORGE," Bye Mrs Seinfeld, take care.",46
25802,GEORGE,"  Morty, always a pleasure.",46
25803,JERRY, Take care now. So long.,46
25804,GEORGE," Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.",46
25805,JERRY," Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.",46
25806,GEORGE, You're kidding.,46
25807,JERRY," He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.",46
25808,GEORGE," Man, would I like to see the look on his face.",46
25809,JERRY," ...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, ""Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now."" ""This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration."" You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration,  ""Here's fifty-six people that know me."" Cop goes. ""Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check.""",46
25810,JERRY," Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone?  You wanted the machine.  You know, and you're always kind of thrown off,  you go ""Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you.""",47
25811,JERRY, Well this is it.,47
25812,JERRY," Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.",47
25813,JERRY," No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.",47
25814,JERRY," No, I mean, I don't think so.",47
25815,JERRY," No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.",47
25816,JERRY, That's not funny Naomi.,47
25817,JERRY," I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.",47
25818,GEORGE,"  Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.",47
25819,GEORGE,"  All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?",47
25820,GEORGE,"  A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...",47
25821,JERRY, This thing has never worked right. ,47
25822,JERRY," Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. ""I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa "" Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ...  it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.",47
25823,JERRY, How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?,47
25824,GEORGE, Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?,47
25825,JERRY, Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!,47
25826,GEORGE," Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.",47
25827,JERRY," Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.",47
25828,GEORGE," What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.",47
25829,JERRY," Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.",47
25830,GEORGE, Wh-Well maybe you should ask Elaine.,47
25831,JERRY," Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.",47
25832,GEORGE," Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.",47
25833,JERRY," Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?",47
25834,KRAMER, Hmm.,47
25835,JERRY," Ah, Kramer.",47
25836,KRAMER," Hello boys,  top of the morning to ya. What do you say?													What do ya be?",47
25837,JERRY, Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.,47
25838,KRAMER," So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?",47
25839,KRAMER, Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.,47
25840,JERRY, Westchester? Isn't that a private club?,47
25841,KRAMER," Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.",47
25842,JERRY, and GEORGE,47
25843,KRAMER," Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend.  Ffoooo ",47
25844,GEORGE," Gee, that's-that's too bad.",47
25845,JERRY," Yeah, too bad.",47
25846,KRAMER, Why? What wa?,47
25847,GEORGE," Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend.  Susan's father has a cabin up there.  But, eh, all right, well.",47
25848,KRAMER," Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?",47
25849,GEORGE," No, no that's ah, that's pie country.",47

25860,ELAINE, I don't know.,47
25861,JERRY, Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.,47
25862,ELAINE, What's that?,47
25863,JERRY," Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.",47
25864,ELAINE," ""I'm very imPRESSED""? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?",47
25865,JERRY," Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?",47

25885,ELAINE, The remote goes through the bubble?,47

25888,ELAINE," Yeah, of course, yeah. ",47

25897,JERRY, He lives in a bubble.,47
25898,GEORGE, Boy!,47
25899,JERRY," No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.",47
25900,GEORGE, What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?,47
25901,JERRY," That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.  It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.",47

25930,ELAINE, Isn't that blue car him?,47
25931,JERRY," No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?",47
25932,ELAINE, It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.,47
25933,JERRY, I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.,47
25934,ELAINE," Wa',you don't have the directions?",47

25952,GEORGE, I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.,47
25953,GEORGE, I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.,47

25961,JERRY,  You can't just have water.,47
25962,ELAINE, Why not? That's all I want.,47
25963,JERRY, Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.,47
25964,JERRY," Oh, no.",47

25986,ELAINE, THIS is what you came up with?,47
25987,JERRY, Well.,47
25988,ELAINE," That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.",47

26002,ELAINE, This chicken is really good.													 													 ,47
26003,GEORGE, All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?,47
26004,GEORGE," Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.",47

26045,JERRY, What are you two doin' here?,47
26046,JERRY, You didn't ... ,47
26047,KRAMER, My Cubans!  													 													 ,47

26052,JERRY, You're meetin' the father for the first time?,48
26053,GEORGE,  Yeah.,48
26054,JERRY,"  Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.",48
26055,GEORGE, I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!,48
26056,JERRY,"  I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it",48
26057,GEORGE," Yeah, I know what happened.",48
26058,JERRY," No, but wait, wait",48
26059,GEORGE,  I know.,48
26060,JERRY,"  ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars!  It's very comical..",48
26061,GEORGE," Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.",48
26062,JERRY,"  No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.",48
26063,GEORGE,"  I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..",48
26064,JERRY,"  C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.",48
26065,GEORGE, We could build a cabin like  that.,48
26066,JERRY,"  Well, maybe not us, but two men could.",48
26067,GEORGE,"  Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?",48
26068,JERRY," What, you got a problem with the pen now?",48
26069,GEORGE," Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.",48
26070,JERRY," Alright, let's just get to work.  NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.",48
26071,GEORGE,"  So, you're gonna sit there?",48
26072,JERRY,"  Just - just park yourself.  Alright. Act I, Scene A.",48

26076,JERRY," Act I, Scene A..",48
26077,GEORGE, Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?,48
26078,JERRY,"  Yes.  Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold.  Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes.  Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it.  I'll be off in a minute!  Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks!  Are you thinking of ideas?  Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes.  So we're on for later?",48
26079,ELAINE," Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here..  Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go.  Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?",48
26080,JERRY," Okay, let's go. ",48

26083,GEORGE, Here we go.,48
26084,JERRY," Okay, how about this",48
26085,GEORGE,"  It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?",48
26086,ELAINE," Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?",48
26087,ELAINE," No, no.",48
26088,ELAINE," Oh, no, he didn't say anything.",48
26089,ELAINE,"  No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!",48
26090,GEORGE," Alright, let's go.",48
26091,JERRY, Here we go.,48
26092,KRAMER, Hey.,48
26093,GEORGE," yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..",48
26094,JERRY," Yeah, come on.  What's with you?",48
26095,KRAMER,  No more golf.,48
26096,JERRY, Why?,48
26097,KRAMER," Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?",48
26098,JERRY, Yeah.,48
26099,KRAMER,"  Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire!  Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?",48
26100,GEORGE," What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!",48
26101,KRAMER, Why? What's one thing got to do with another?,48
26102,GEORGE," Kramer, please.",48
26103,KRAMER," Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!",48
26104,GEORGE," Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.",48
26105,KRAMER,  Where? They're Cubans. ,48
26106,GEORGE,  You know what? Maybe I should take off.,48
26107,JERRY, What?!,48
26108,GEORGE," Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.",48
26109,JERRY,  You got four hours! What about the script?,48
26110,GEORGE, I think we got a bite on it. ,48
26111,GEORGE," Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..",48
26112,GEORGE," Oh, uh, the cigars..  I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.",48
26113,GEORGE,  I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. ,48
26114,GEORGE," Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going ""Ha, ha!""? What is that? ""Ha, ha!""?",48
26115,GEORGE,"  Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, ",48
26116,JERRY," Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!",48
26117,ELAINE,  I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?,48
26118,JERRY,  Ohh.. dial the number.  How could you do this?,48
26119,ELAINE,  I was just trying to help you.,48
26120,JERRY,"  Oh, just trying to  help me..  Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld.  Listen, I - I just want to tell you,  There's been a terrible misunderstanding",48
26121,GEORGE, The cabin..  Well..  Susan?,48
26122,GEORGE,  Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.,48
26123,GEORGE," S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..",48
26124,GEORGE,  Burned.,48
26125,GEORGE, Burned.,48
26126,GEORGE,"  yeah, burned. Whoo..",48
26127,GEORGE," Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical..  Really. Think about it.",48
26128,JERRY, What?!,48
26129,JERRY, What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!,48
26130,JERRY, Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.,48
26131,JERRY,  I'm not sick.  You - you said much sicker things than me.,48
26132,JERRY, I really think you're making too much of this.,48
26133,JERRY, Let me walk you to a cab.,48
26134,JERRY," I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.",48
26135,JERRY,"  I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.",48
26136,JERRY," So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.",48
26137,GEORGE, Wo-hoah! What did you do?,48
26138,JERRY,  Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?,48
26139,GEORGE," Yeah, right.",48
26140,JERRY," I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, ""That hand should not be on my leg."" But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, ""Would you mind?!""",48
26141,GEORGE," Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?",48
26142,JERRY," I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..",48
26143,GEORGE," Alright, so, go ahead.",48
26144,JERRY, So we go back to my apartment..,48
26145,GEORGE,  Woah. Whoa! Woah!,48
26146,JERRY," So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate..  and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.",48
26147,GEORGE,"  Alright, alright, hold on!  Time out! Woah, woah!  What did she say?",48
26148,JERRY,"  Oh, you know, the usual..",48
26149,GEORGE," No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?",48
26150,JERRY, Typical things.,48
26151,GEORGE,  What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.,48
26152,JERRY," She says, uh.. ",48
26153,GEORGE,  That's very dirty.  That's absolutely filthy.,48
26154,JERRY, ..And then she starts talking about her panties.,48
26155,GEORGE,  Gonna need some water here!,48
26156,JERRY, So I said something.,48
26157,GEORGE," Ok, what did you say?",48
26158,JERRY,"  Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.",48
26159,GEORGE, Of course.,48
26160,JERRY," Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, ""You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?""",48
26161,GEORGE,"  ""The panties your mother laid out for you""?  What does that mean?",48
26162,JERRY,  I don't know! It just popped out.,48
26163,GEORGE," Well, how did she react?",48
26164,JERRY, She flipped out! Just left.,48
26165,GEORGE," Well, that's not offensive.  It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.",48
26166,JERRY," Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.",48
26167,JERRY," She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that?  Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?",48
26168,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.",48
26169,JERRY, I guess he failed to see the humor in it.,48
26170,GEORGE," Huh.  C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.",48
26171,JERRY,"  Alright, big work day.",48
26172,GEORGE, That's right.,48
26173,GEORGE, Okay.,48
26174,JERRY, Let's go.,48
26175,GEORGE, Here we are.,48

26186,KRAMER,"  Oh, yeah?",48
26187,JERRY, Yeah!,48
26188,KRAMER," Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?",48
26189,GEORGE,"  No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.",48
26190,KRAMER,"  Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh?  Alright, I'll see you guys. ",48
26191,KRAMER, Buenos dias.,48
26192,KRAMER," Uh, habla ingles?",48
26193,KRAMER," Giddy-up. Ok, uh,  Um. I need to talk to someone.",48
26194,KRAMER," Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.",48
26195,KRAMER," Oh, yeah.",48
26196,KRAMER, Okay.,48
26197,JERRY,"  Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now.  C'mon, let's get it together..  Yeah?",48

26201,JERRY,"  Yeah, we should.",48
26202,GEORGE," Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?",48
26203,JERRY," Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?",48
26204,GEORGE," No, no, no, no.",48

26206,ELAINE," Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld!",48
26207,JERRY, What?,48
26208,ELAINE," I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.",48
26209,JERRY," Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.",48
26210,ELAINE, Why? What happened? Did you talk?,48
26211,JERRY, Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.,48
26212,ELAINE, Really?,48
26213,JERRY, Yes.,48
26214,ELAINE, Really? You really think I should fire her?,48

26375,ELAINE," Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.",49
26376,ELAINE," Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.",49
26377,ELAINE," Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown",49
26378,JERRY,"  But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.",49
26379,JERRY,  Who is it?,49
26380,GEORGE, It's George.,49
26381,GEORGE," What, are you locking the door now?",49
26382,JERRY," Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?",49
26383,GEORGE," Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.",49
26384,JERRY," Ooo, that was a bad toast.",49
26385,GEORGE, It wasn't that bad.,49
26386,JERRY, I never heard anybody curse in a toast.,49
26387,GEORGE, I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.,49
26388,JERRY," There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.",49
26389,GEORGE," Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.",49
26390,JERRY, What do you mean not going? why not?,49
26391,GEORGE," I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.",49
26392,JERRY, Why doesn't she pay for hers?,49
26393,GEORGE," That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?",49
26394,JERRY, It's nice to get a reach.,49
26395,JERRY, Who is it?,49
26396,KRAMER, It's me!,49
26397,KRAMER," What, are you locking the door now?",49
26398,JERRY, Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?,49
26399,KRAMER, I am dressed.,49

26401,KRAMER, Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.,49
26402,JERRY, I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!,49
26403,KRAMER," People do, I don't.",49
26404,JERRY," Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.",49
26405,GEORGE," Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!",49
26406,JERRY, Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?,49
26407,GEORGE," That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!",49
26408,JERRY," All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.",49
26409,JERRY, Would you turn that down! What is that crap!,49
26410,KRAMER, It's Pagliacci!,49
26411,JERRY," Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.",49
26412,KRAMER, Why? What happened?,49
26413,JERRY, Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.,49
26414,KRAMER," That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.",49
26415,GEORGE, What? Really?,49
26416,KRAMER, Yeah.,49
26417,GEORGE, People are looking for tickets here?,49
26418,KRAMER," What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!",49

26421,KRAMER," OK come on, let?s go get the tickets.",49
26422,GEORGE," All right, all right.",49
26423,JERRY," All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.",49
26424,GEORGE," Oh, wait, isn't scalping illegal?",49
26425,KRAMER, Oh yeah!,49
26426,JERRY, You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?,49
26427,ELAINE," Cherry Binaca, it?s new.",49
26428,JERRY," See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!",49
26429,ELAINE, It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.,49
26430,JERRY," Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.",49
26431,JERRY," Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter.",49

26433,JERRY," All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.",49
26434,JERRY," What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money.",49

26476,JERRY," Oh my god, its Joe Divola",49
26477,ELAINE, Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?,49
26478,JERRY, That madman is trying to kill me.,49
26479,ELAINE," Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!",49
26480,JERRY," Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!",49
26481,ELAINE," Oooohh, what about me!",49
26482,GEORGE, But this is Pavarotti!,49

26487,JERRY," I'm telling you, the guy took.....",49
26488,ELAINE," I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.",49
26489,JERRY, That is one angry clown!,49
26490,JERRY," The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. ""Who was that clown?"", ""I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?"", ""The guy's a clown!"". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, ""What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!""",49
26491,JERRY,"  Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!",49
26492,ELAINE," You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.",49
26493,JERRY," Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.",49
26494,ELAINE, I smell cherry.,49
26495,JERRY, Binaca?,49
26496,GEORGE, What did we say? Two seventy-five?,49
26497,GEORGE, Two fifty? Are you sure,49
26498,GEORGE," All right, all right, two fifty.",49
26499,GEORGE, S-Susan,49
26500,GEORGE," What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.",49
26501,GEORGE," So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?",49
26502,GEORGE," Yeah you made it, how about that.",49
26503,GEORGE, We get to go to the opera together!,49
26504,GEORGE," That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.",49
26505,JERRY," Come on, you gotta let us in",49
26506,JERRY," We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.",49
26507,JERRY," You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.",49
26508,KRAMER, Are you guys ready?,49
26509,KRAMER, Have you seen George?,49
26510,JERRY, We thought he was with you.,49
26511,ELAINE," Come on, he's on his own, come on!",49
26512,KRAMER, These are great seats huh?,49
26513,ELAINE, Yeah,49
26514,KRAMER, Yeah,49
26515,JERRY," Boy, some cast, huh? Pavarotti, Aver Martone.",49
26516,ELAINE," Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?",49
26517,JERRY," She's playing, Pagliacci?s wife, Nedda.",49
26518,ELAINE, Nedda?,49
26519,JERRY, Yeah.,49
26520,ELAINE, Oh my god..,49
26521,JERRY, Susan! What are you doing here?,49
26522,JERRY, Where's George?,49
26523,JERRY," Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?",49
26524,JERRY," Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to?",49
26525,KRAMER, Some nut in a clown suit!,49
26526,JERRY," I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.",49
26527,JERRY, We're dead.,50
26528,GEORGE, We're not dead.,50
26529,JERRY, We are dead.,50
26530,GEORGE, Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.,50
26531,JERRY, All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.,50
26532,GEORGE, So we'll do it tomorrow.,50
26533,JERRY, Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?,50
26534,GEORGE, About six years ago.,50
26535,JERRY, I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.,50
26536,GEORGE, Women like skiers.,50
26537,JERRY, So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.,50
26538,GEORGE, Yeah. Right.,50
26539,JERRY," Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.",50
26540,GEORGE, The closet business? What's the closet business?,50
26541,JERRY, What is it your business?,50
26542,GEORGE, I'm interested.,50
26543,JERRY, She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.,50
26544,GEORGE, So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.,50
26545,JERRY, Yeah.,50
26546,GEORGE, Yeah. So what happened?,50
26547,JERRY," So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for?  Hi, Marla.",50
26548,JERRY," George, Marla.",50
26549,GEORGE, Marla.,50
26550,JERRY, Stacey.,50
26551,JERRY," George, Stacey.",50
26552,GEORGE, Stacey.,50
26553,JERRY, George.,50
26554,GEORGE, Jerry. Marla.  Stacey! ,50
26555,JERRY, Trip to Berlin?,50
26556,JERRY," Oh, right, right.",50
26557,JERRY," Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, ""Why knock my brains out?""",50
26558,JERRY, Really?,50
26559,JERRY," Oh, did he like it?",50
26560,GEORGE," Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.",50
26561,GEORGE, Not a bad way to make a buck.,50
26562,GEORGE," Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. ",50
26563,JERRY," So, are you gonna go out with her?",50
26564,GEORGE, I might.,50
26565,JERRY, What about Susan?,50
26566,GEORGE, What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?,50
26567,JERRY, Depends.,50
26568,GEORGE, Depends on what?,50
26569,JERRY, On many factors.,50
26570,GEORGE, Like what?,50
26571,JERRY," Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?",50
26572,GEORGE, No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.,50
26573,JERRY," What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?",50
26574,GEORGE, Implied.,50
26575,JERRY, She got anything in your medicine cabinet?,50
26576,GEORGE, There might be some moisturizer.,50
26577,JERRY, Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?,50
26578,GEORGE,  Yeah.,50
26579,JERRY," Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.",50
26580,GEORGE, What?,50
26581,JERRY, You got yourself a girlfriend.,50
26582,GEORGE," Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?",50
26583,JERRY," I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...",50
26584,GEORGE," Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, ""What do you do?"" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.",50
26585,JERRY, You're going to make a good father someday.,50
26586,GEORGE," Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.",50
26587,JERRY, Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?,50
26588,GEORGE," No, what?",50
26589,JERRY," The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.",50
26590,GEORGE, Why? What do you mean?,50
26591,JERRY," Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?",50
26592,GEORGE," Oh, right. Oh no, man.",50
26593,JERRY," you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?",50
26594,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.",50
26595,JERRY,"  Oh, yeah.",50
26596,GEORGE," Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.",50
26597,JERRY, This is your plan?,50
26598,GEORGE," No, no. I'm just thinking.",50
26599,JERRY, I don't think you are.,50
26600,JERRY," Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.",50
26601,JERRY, I don't think I am.,50
26602,JERRY, Try me.,50
26603,JERRY, Everything?,50
26604,JERRY," You're quite mad, you know.  Oh, I don't believe this.  Hey?",50
26605,KRAMER, Hey.,50
26606,JERRY, What are you doing?,50
26607,KRAMER, I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.,50
26608,JERRY, No.,50
26609,KRAMER, What?,50
26610,JERRY, This is not a good time.,50
26611,KRAMER, Five minutes. What?,50
26612,JERRY, What did you have to give your TV away to George for?,50
26613,KRAMER," Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.",50
26614,JERRY," Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. ",50
26615,KRAMER," Well, wow.",50
26616,JERRY," Marla, Kramer.",50
26617,KRAMER, Hey.,50
26618,JERRY, Why don't you go out? It's nice out.,50
26619,KRAMER," Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.",50
26620,JERRY, There's weather.,50
26621,KRAMER, Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.,50
26622,JERRY, I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.,50
26623,KRAMER," No, no, I don't want it back.  Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?",50
26624,JERRY, I don't know.,50
26625,KRAMER, Will you tape it?,50
26626,JERRY, Kramer... ,50
26627,KRAMER, Yeah. ,50
26628,JERRY, So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.,50
26629,JERRY," Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.",50
26630,JERRY, Ah hah.  Excuse me one second. Yeah?,50
26631,ELAINE, It's me.,50
26632,JERRY," Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now.  I'm sorry. What?",50
26633,ELAINE, I didn't get it.,50
26634,JERRY, Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.,50
26635,JERRY, Snapple?,50
26636,JERRY, Go on.,50
26637,JERRY, Yes.,50
26638,JERRY, Yeah.,50
26639,ELAINE, Hello!,50
26640,JERRY," Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.",50
26641,ELAINE," I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.",50
26642,JERRY," Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.",50
26643,ELAINE," I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.",50
26644,ELAINE," No, no, I'm leaving.",50
26645,JERRY, I like that thing in your hair there.,50
26646,ELAINE, Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?,50
26647,ELAINE," I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right?  Ahh.",50
26648,JERRY, So we'll talk about the hooks then?,50
26649,ELAINE, What? Was it something I said?,50
26650,JERRY," She's a virgin, she just told me.",50
26651,ELAINE, Well I didn't know.,50
26652,JERRY, Well it's not like spotting a toupee.,50
26653,ELAINE, Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?,50
26654,JERRY," No, no, I mean...",50
26655,ELAINE, 'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. ,50
26656,JERRY," Elaine, Elaine...  Yeah?",50
26657,GEORGE, It's George.,50
26658,GEORGE, She's a virgin?,50
26659,JERRY, A virgin.,50
26660,GEORGE, Wow. So what're you gonna do?,50
26661,JERRY," I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.",50
26662,GEORGE," I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.",50
26663,JERRY," You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.",50
26664,GEORGE," You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back.  I'm really hungry.",50
26665,JERRY," Yeah, me too.",50
26666,GEORGE, We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?,50
26667,JERRY," All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything.  Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything--  let me know what it is and I'll order for you.",50
26668,KRAMER, I'm in. Let's go for it.,50
26669,GEORGE, What do you want?,50
26670,KRAMER," I don't care, whatever.",50
26671,GEORGE, I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.,50
26672,KRAMER, Okay. What are you getting?,50
26673,GEORGE, I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.,50
26674,KRAMER, What's a Chow Fung?,50
26675,GEORGE, It's a broad noodle.,50
26676,KRAMER," What do you mean, a broad noodle?",50
26677,GEORGE, It's a big flat noodle.,50
26678,KRAMER, Well I don't want a big flat noodle.,50
26679,GEORGE, What kind of noodle do you want?,50
26680,KRAMER, Who says I want a noodle?,50
26681,GEORGE," All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.",50
26682,KRAMER, All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.,50
26683,GEORGE, Fine.,50
26684,KRAMER, Get extra MSG.,50
26685,ELAINE," Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.",50
26686,ELAINE," Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.",50
26687,ELAINE, Eh.,50
26688,JERRY," All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.",50
26689,GEORGE, Where's the food? What happened to Ping?,50
26690,JERRY," Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting.  There's your food.",50
26691,GEORGE," Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?",50
26692,JERRY, Yeah.,50
26693,GEORGE," My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.",50
26694,JERRY, Your butler?,50
26695,GEORGE," Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.",50
26696,JERRY, What about me?,50
26697,GEORGE," Don't worry, we'll find something for you. ",50
26698,JERRY,"  That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler.  Ping, what happened?",50
26699,ELAINE, There was a bit of an accident.,50
26700,JERRY, What happened?,50
26701,ELAINE," Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.",50
26702,GEORGE, Something happened to the food?,50
26703,JERRY, Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?,50
26704,GEORGE,  The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? ,50
26705,KRAMER," Hey, you got the food?",50
26706,JERRY," Yeah, here.",50
26707,KRAMER," What took you so long? Hey, Ping!",50
26708,KRAMER, Yeah. Where's yours?,50
26709,GEORGE, He dropped it.,50
26710,KRAMER," Oh, that's too bad.",50
26711,ELAINE," You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.",50
26712,KRAMER,"  Hey, you watchin' Oprah?",50
26713,ELAINE,  I did not jaywalk.,50
26714,JERRY,  You're givin' him back that TV.,50
26715,KRAMER,"  No, I don't want it back.",50
26716,GEORGE,  We got work to do. What about the meeting?,50
26717,KRAMER,"  Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.",50
26718,JERRY," A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that  , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!",50
26719,GEORGE," All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.",50
26720,JERRY, What do you mean? They know we're here.,50
26721,GEORGE," I'll fake an illness.  My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.",50
26722,JERRY," No, no, would you get up?",50
26723,GEORGE," I can do this, Jerry.",50
26724,JERRY, No.,50
26725,GEORGE," All right, I'll tell them my sister died.  My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.",50
26726,JERRY, What?,50
26727,GEORGE, That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. ,50
26728,JERRY," Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. ",50
26729,JERRY," Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.",50
26730,JERRY," Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?",50
26731,JERRY," Oh, poor Blossom. ",50
26732,JERRY," Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.",50
26733,JERRY," Yeah, he just walked by.",50
26734,JERRY," Yeah, good idea.",50
26735,JERRY," Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.",50
26736,JERRY," Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table.  Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?",50
26737,JERRY," Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler.  You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.",50
26738,GEORGE," You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late.  Russell?",50
26739,GEORGE," Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure.  Sweetie.  Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer?  I thought I was getting the butler.",50
26740,JERRY," Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.",50
26741,JERRY," So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?",50
26742,GEORGE," No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.",50
26743,KRAMER," You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.",50
26744,JERRY, Would you give him the TV back?,50
26745,KRAMER," Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.",50
26746,GEORGE, I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? ,50
26747,KRAMER,  Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!,50
26748,GEORGE," Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?",50
26749,GEORGE, Fired? Why?,50
26750,KRAMER,  What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.,50
26751,GEORGE, But I had no... I didn't realize.,50
26752,GEORGE, I just feel terrible This is just terrible.,50
26753,KRAMER,"  What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.",50
26754,GEORGE,"  this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!",50
26755,JERRY, Why did he fire her?,50
26756,GEORGE," Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!",50
26757,KRAMER," What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!",50
26758,JERRY, You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.,50
26759,GEORGE, What?,50
26760,JERRY, You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.,50
26761,GEORGE, Another job?,50
26762,JERRY, Couple of interviews.,50
26763,GEORGE," Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.",50
26764,JERRY, What? Leave? Where? Why?,50
26765,JERRY, Why would I leave? This is my apartment.,50
26766,JERRY, Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?,50
26767,JERRY," Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.",50
26768,JERRY, What else did you say to her?,50
26769,ELAINE, Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.,50
26770,JERRY," More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.",50
26771,ELAINE," Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.",50
26772,JERRY, What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?,50
26773,ELAINE, You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.,50
26774,JERRY, I was trying to be.,50
26775,ELAINE," Look at George.  He lucked out, huh?",50
26776,JERRY," Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.",50
26777,ELAINE," Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.",50
26778,GEORGE," What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.",50
26779,JERRY,"...cramped seat, working on a tiny computer; there's always a small problem ``There'll be a slight delay, we'll be a *little* late, if you could be a *little* *patient*! We're just trying to get one of those *little* trucks to pull us up just a *little* closer to the jetway so you can walk down the narrow hallway and there'll be a man there in a tight suit and he'll tell you you have very little time to make your connecting flight. So move it!''.",52
26780,ELAINE," Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...",52
26781,JERRY," Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?",52
26782,ELAINE, Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.,52
26783,JERRY, I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works,52
26784,ELAINE, Gimme ten bucks and find out...,52
26785,JERRY," So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...",52
26786,ELAINE," Yeah, worked out good.",52
26787,JERRY, And here's the beauty--,52
26788,ELAINE, What?,52
26789,JERRY, George is pickin' us up at the airport.,52
26790,ELAINE, Get out of here! Why?,52
26791,JERRY, You know that awning outside my building?,52
26792,ELAINE, Yeah...,52
26793,JERRY," He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.",52
26794,ELAINE, So what happened?,52
26795,JERRY," He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.",52
26796,ELAINE," Hey, how we doin' on time?",52
26797,JERRY," Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...",52
26798,ELAINE, Hey! Wait up!,52
26799,JERRY, Hey! Wait up!,52
26800,JERRY," Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?",52
26801,ELAINE," Yeah, you want five?",52
26802,JERRY, Gimme ten.,52
26803,ELAINE, You're giving him *ten* dollars?,52
26804,JERRY," Well, we got three bags.",52
26805,ELAINE, That's a pretty big tip...,52
26806,JERRY, That's what they get!,52
26807,ELAINE, They don't get that much.,52
26808,JERRY, Let's ask him.,52
26809,ELAINE, We can't ask him...,52
26810,JERRY, Let's see what he says.,52
26811,ELAINE," Jerry, we don't have time for this...",52
26812,JERRY," Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.",52
26813,JERRY," Uh, how about a couple of people like us.",52
26814,JERRY," C'mon, seriously...",52
26815,ELAINE, What!?,52
26816,ELAINE, *Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.,52
26817,ELAINE, You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...,52
26818,JERRY," All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...",52
26819,ELAINE, You're lucky I don't report you...,52
26820,ELAINE, Wait up!,52
26821,JERRY," You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!",52
26822,JERRY, We'll take 'em!,52
26823,ELAINE, We're not going to sit together?,52
26824,JERRY," Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.",52
26825,ELAINE," Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.",52
26826,JERRY, We'll call him...,52
26827,ELAINE, There's no time.,52
26828,JERRY, No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?,52
26829,JERRY," There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.",52
26830,JERRY, I'll take the first class.,52
26831,ELAINE, Jerry!,52
26832,JERRY, What?,52
26833,ELAINE, Why should you get the first class?,52
26834,JERRY," Elaine, have you ever flown first class?",52
26835,ELAINE, No.,52
26836,JERRY," All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...",52
26837,ELAINE, You flew here coach.,52
26838,JERRY," Yeah, that's a point...",52
26839,ELAINE," All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.",52
26840,JERRY," Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.",52
26841,JERRY," Bon voyage, Lainey!",52
26842,ELAINE, Great... [To herself] Help me...,52
26843,JERRY," Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!",52
26844,GEORGE," Hey, thanks for coming with me.",52
26845,KRAMER," Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?",52
26846,GEORGE, I confused it with another awning.,52
26847,KRAMER, So how we doin' on time?,52
26848,GEORGE," We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup.  What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!",52
26849,KRAMER, Will you relax?!,52
26850,GEORGE," Oh, I had it perfectly timed out",52
26851,KRAMER, This is the best way to go!,52
26852,GEORGE, Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...,52
26853,KRAMER," George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...",52
26854,GEORGE, Really?,52
26855,KRAMER," If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.",52
26856,GEORGE, The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?,52
26857,KRAMER, Duty.,52
26858,GEORGE," Yeah, ""duty"". Do you know how much duty is?",52
26859,KRAMER," No, I dunno how much duty is.",52
26860,GEORGE, Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...,52
26861,KRAMER, I still like to stop at the duty free shop.,52
26862,GEORGE, I like to stop at the duty free shop.,52
26863,JERRY, Oh my...,52
26864,JERRY, Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?,52
26865,JERRY, Uh-huh...,52
26866,KRAMER, How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...,52
26867,ELAINE," Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.",52
26868,GEORGE, They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!,52
26869,KRAMER, Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!,52
26870,GEORGE," Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.",52
26871,KRAMER," No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.",52
26872,GEORGE, Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!,52
26873,KRAMER," Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.",52
26874,KRAMER, Did you see that guy?,52
26875,GEORGE, No... What guy?,52
26876,KRAMER, That guy.. He was just...,52
26877,GEORGE," Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!",52
26878,KRAMER, [still lost] I know that guy...,52
26879,GEORGE," Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first.",52
26880,GEORGE," You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!",52
26881,GEORGE, Umm... No.,52
26882,GEORGE," But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!",52
26883,KRAMER," They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.",52
26884,GEORGE," Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...",52
26885,KRAMER, Where do I know that guy from?,52
26886,ELAINE," [To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...",52
26887,JERRY, Oh my... that *is* refreshing...,52
26888,JERRY," Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?",52
26889,JERRY," Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.",52
26890,GEORGE, My name is not mentioned in this blurb...,52
26891,KRAMER, It's Grossbard!,52
26892,GEORGE, Who's Grossbard?,52
26893,KRAMER," When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!",52
26894,GEORGE," Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...",52
26895,KRAMER," No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...",52
26896,GEORGE," No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.",52
26897,JERRY," Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.",52
26898,JERRY, I thought I smelled lilac.,52
26899,ELAINE, [To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?,52
26900,GEORGE," Well, You're not gonna believe it...",52
26901,KRAMER, What?,52
26902,GEORGE, The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.,52
26903,KRAMER," Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.",52
26904,JERRY," Oh, saffron! That sounds good.",52
26905,ELAINE, Hi. Can I get to my seat?,52
26906,ELAINE, But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...,52
26907,ELAINE," Well, nobody *told* me that!",52
26908,GEORGE, There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.,52
26909,KRAMER, Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!,52
26910,GEORGE, How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.,52
26911,KRAMER, Gimme your credit card.,52
26912,GEORGE, My credit card?,52
26913,KRAMER," Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.",52
26914,GEORGE, I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!,52
26915,KRAMER, I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.,52
26916,GEORGE," What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.",52
26917,KRAMER," No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.",52
26918,GEORGE, This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.,52
26919,ELAINE," Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...",52
26920,ELAINE, I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?,52
26921,ELAINE," Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.",52
26922,ELAINE," Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.",52
26923,ELAINE, Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.,52
26924,ELAINE, Then why didn't you take it?,52
26925,ELAINE, You're eating my food!,52
26926,JERRY," Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.",52
26927,JERRY, Thank you...,52
26928,JERRY, More everything!,52
26929,KRAMER," Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon.",52
26930,GEORGE, Super Savers? Are they refundable!?,52
26931,GEORGE," You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!",52
26932,KRAMER, She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.,52
26933,GEORGE, Do you know how much this is going to cost me?,52
26934,KRAMER," Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you",52
26935,GEORGE," Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...",52
26936,ELAINE," What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks.",52
26937,ELAINE, Elaine Benes?,52
26938,ELAINE," No, but there was nobody sitting here...",52
26939,ELAINE," Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!",52
26940,ELAINE," Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!",52
26941,JERRY," What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?",52
26942,JERRY," Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.",52
26943,KRAMER, Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!,52
26944,JERRY, Couldn't be...,52
26945,JERRY," Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.",52
26946,ELAINE," Yeah, *you* got *your* bags...",52
26947,ELAINE, The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.,52
26948,JERRY," Yeah, me too...",52
26949,JERRY, Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...,52
26950,KRAMER, You guys ready?,52
26951,JERRY, Yeah. Where's George?,52
26952,GEORGE,  Kramer!,52
26953,GEORGE," I loved her Jerry, I loved her.",53
26954,JERRY," No, you didn't.",53
26955,GEORGE," And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.",53
26956,JERRY, No she didn't.,53
26957,GEORGE," What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?",53
26958,ELAINE," [OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.",53
26959,GEORGE, Who says?,53
26960,ELAINE, You did.,53
26961,GEORGE," Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.",53
26962,JERRY, You walk around with no underwear?,53
26963,GEORGE," Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?",53
26964,JERRY, I do a wash.,53
26965,GEORGE," Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.",53
26966,JERRY, When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.,53
26967,GEORGE, I loved her!,53
26968,JERRY, You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.,53
26969,GEORGE, I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.,53
26970,GEORGE, I gotta call her. Should I call her?,53
26971,JERRY," George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?",53
26972,GEORGE, Whyie?,53
26973,JERRY, You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.,53
26974,GEORGE, I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.,53
26975,JERRY," No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.",53
26976,ELAINE, Dana Folley.,53
26977,JERRY," Right, Dana Folley.",53
26978,GEORGE, She any good?,53
26979,ELAINE," Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?",53
26980,GEORGE," Wa, uh, ...",53
26981,ELAINE, Tia? Who's that?,53
26982,JERRY, She's the model I met on the plane.,53
26983,ELAINE, She sent you a Christmas card?,53
26984,JERRY, Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.,53
26985,GEORGE, My Darling Susan! My DARLING!!!,53
26986,JERRY, What are you doing?,53
26987,ELAINE, ... date with Fred.,53
26988,JERRY, The religious guy?,53
26989,ELAINE, He's not THAT religious.,53
26990,JERRY, Let us pray.,53
26991,KRAMER," Hey, you got any Double Crunch?",53
26992,JERRY, Yeah.,53
26993,JERRY," Kramer, should I call Susan?",53
26994,KRAMER, Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.,53
26995,GEORGE, My little man doesn't know.,53
26996,KRAMER, The little man knows all.,53
26997,GEORGE, My little man's an idiot.,53
26998,ELAINE," See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.",53
26999,KRAMER, You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...,53
27000,GEORGE, She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.,53
27001,ELAINE," No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.",53
27002,KRAMER," No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.",53
27003,GEORGE, She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.,53
27004,KRAMER," All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.",53
27005,ELAINE, Really? Can you really take a picture?,53
27006,JERRY," Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.",53
27007,ELAINE," All right, ha ha",53
27008,KRAMER, I don't know about that outfit though.,53
27009,ELAINE, Why? What's wrong with it?,53
27010,KRAMER," Well, we'll have to improvise.",53
27011,GEORGE,"  Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...",53
27012,JERRY, George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.													 ,53
27013,JERRY," So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.",53
27014,JERRY," Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.",53
27015,JERRY, What's that perfume you're wearing?,53
27016,JERRY, What is that smell?,53
27017,JERRY, It smells like the beach.,53
27018,JERRY, Oh my God is that the new perfume?,53
27019,JERRY, I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.,53
27020,JERRY, And you're the model for this perfume?,53
27021,JERRY," Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]",53
27022,KRAMER, Hey,53
27023,JERRY, Hey.,53
27024,KRAMER," Hey, how ya' doing? [Trying to enter]",53
27025,JERRY," Yeah, uh, I'll see you later.",53

27030,KRAMER, Come on lets see - Back to Back.,53
27031,JERRY, NO! Kramer!,53
27032,KRAMER, What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.,53
27033,JERRY," Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.",53
27034,KRAMER, What's that?,53
27035,JERRY, What?,53
27036,KRAMER, That smell. What's that smell?,53
27037,JERRY,  What smell?,53

27044,JERRY," Ooow, that was close.",53
27045,KRAMER, [OC] THE BEACH!!!,53
27046,KRAMER, You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.,53
27047,KRAMER," CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.",53
27048,JERRY, I know look at this [shows ad],53
27049,KRAMER," Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.",53
27050,GEORGE," Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?",53
27051,GEORGE," Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?",53
27052,GEORGE, What is with this damn zipper?,53
27053,GEORGE, It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.,53
27054,GEORGE," This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...",53
27055,GEORGE, ... Susan.,53
27056,GEORGE," UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.",53
27057,ELAINE, Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.,53
27058,JERRY," Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. . A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.",53
27059,ELAINE, It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.,53
27060,JERRY, I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?,53
27061,ELAINE," Well, you know. It's a picture?",53
27062,JERRY, Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.,53
27063,ELAINE," Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?",53
27064,JERRY, ... um ...,53
27065,ELAINE, What?,53
27066,JERRY, Did you look at look at this picture carefully?,53
27067,ELAINE, Carefully?,53
27068,JERRY, Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.,53
27069,ELAINE, What?,53
27070,JERRY," Here. Take a look. What, what is that?",53
27071,ELAINE,  Oh my God! That's my nipple.,53
27072,JERRY, That's what I thought.,53
27073,ELAINE," That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.",53
27074,JERRY, DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?,53
27075,ELAINE," Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.",53
27076,KRAMER, Hey!,53
27077,ELAINE, Have you seen the card?,53
27078,KRAMER, What card?,53
27079,ELAINE, This car.,53
27080,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it.",53
27081,ELAINE, Well did you notice anything unusual about it?,53
27082,KRAMER, No.,53
27083,ELAINE, Well come here and take a look.,53
27084,KRAMER," Yeah, so?",53
27085,ELAINE," So, what's that?",53
27086,KRAMER, That's a nipple.,53
27087,ELAINE, Right!!,53
27088,KRAMER, Ooo!,53
27089,ELAINE," Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?",53
27090,KRAMER," Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,",53
27091,ELAINE, It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.,53
27092,JERRY," Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.",53
27093,ELAINE, No. I don't want him looking.,53
27094,JERRY, Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.,53
27095,ELAINE, Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.,53
27096,JERRY, Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.,53
27097,JERRY, Okay. Thanks.,53
27098,JERRY, No.,53
27099,JERRY, What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.,53
27100,KRAMER, I got them too.,53
27101,JERRY, Everybody's got them.,53
27102,GEORGE, Pull it up a little bit.,53
27103,GEORGE," Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate.",53
27104,GEORGE, Take it right off the chest...,53
27105,GEORGE, You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.,53
27106,GEORGE," Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?",53
27107,GEORGE, ,53
27108,JERRY," No, No, No, No, Oh, No.",53
27109,JERRY, Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.,53
27110,GEORGE, Was it a scratch or a pick?,53
27111,JERRY, It was a scratch.,53
27112,GEORGE, Hey. It's me.,53
27113,JERRY, Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?,53
27114,JERRY, Yeah?,53
27115,ELAINE,  It's me.,53
27116,JERRY, Come on up.,53
27117,GEORGE, Was there any nostril penetration?,53
27118,JERRY, There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.,53
27119,GEORGE," So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?",53
27120,JERRY, Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?,53
27121,GEORGE, I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.,53
27122,JERRY," Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?",53
27123,GEORGE, No. That's disgusting!,53
27124,ELAINE," You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!",53
27125,GEORGE," Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.",53
27126,ELAINE, You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.,53
27127,KRAMER, Got any Double Crunch?,53
27128,JERRY, yeah. I think I do.,53
27129,KRAMER, What's that perfume?,53
27130,ELAINE," What, Ocean.",53
27131,KRAMER, That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.,53
27132,JERRY, I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.,53
27133,KRAMER, I thought you said it was a scratch.,53
27134,JERRY, But that's not what she thinks.,53
27135,GEORGE, Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.,53
27136,JERRY," All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.",53
27137,KRAMER, Let's go.,53
27138,GEORGE, It'll be different this time.,53
27139,GEORGE," I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!",53
27140,GEORGE, I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.,53
27141,GEORGE, And I am not a piece of toast.,53
27142,GEORGE," That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.",53
27143,GEORGE, Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins],53
27144,GEORGE, Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!,53
27145,KRAMER, I want to talk to Calvin.,53
27146,KRAMER, Let me talk to Calvin.,53
27147,KRAMER," Yeah, uh.",53
27148,KRAMER, I'm here to talk about the ocean.,53
27149,KRAMER, Now I don't want any trouble Calvin.,53
27150,JERRY, Hello there you are.,53
27151,JERRY," Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.",53
27152,JERRY," Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me ",53
27153,JERRY, But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.,53
27154,JERRY, But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!,53
27155,JERRY, No! No pick!,53
27156,KRAMER," All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..",53
27157,KRAMER," Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.",53
27158,KRAMER," Well, yeah.",53
27159,KRAMER," You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.",53
27160,KRAMER,  Oh?,53
27161,ELAINE," I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.",53
27162,ELAINE," Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.",53
27163,ELAINE," Oh, you've never missed a button?!  Yeah?..",53
27164,ELAINE," Oh, God - my nephew.  Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.",53
27165,ELAINE," Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me ""Nip""!  It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.",53
27166,JERRY," An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught.  Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you..  Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?!  I am not an animal!",53
27167,ELAINE," I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had!  Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!",53
27168,JERRY, The pick?,53
27169,ELAINE, The pick?,53
27170,GEORGE," She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.",53
27171,JERRY, I think I've seen that look.,53
27172,KRAMER, I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.,53
27173,JERRY," Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.",53
27174,GEORGE, Your buttocks are spectacular.,53
27175,ELAINE, Oh my!,53
27176,KRAMER, What?,53
27177,ELAINE, I'm not sure but... I think I see your...,53
27178,JERRY, You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 9,54
27179,JERRY," And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!												% In the background is the plot complication of the week",54
27180,JERRY," No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 10",54
27181,JERRY," [not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]												% At the Paragon Theater, George joins the end of a queue. He taps the shoulder of the man in front of him.",54
27182,GEORGE," Excuse me, do you have a ticket?",54
27183,GEORGE, Okay. Good.												% Misunderstanding number one,54
27184,JERRY, What are <you> doing here?,54
27185,ELAINE, I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''.,54
27186,GEORGE," Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.",54
27187,ELAINE," ``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!",54
27188,GEORGE, ``Ponce de Leon''? But that was great!,54
27189,ELAINE," Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!",54
27190,GEORGE," Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.												% Apparently, a movie that can be interpreted on two levels. Misunderstanding number two",54
27191,KRAMER," Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.",54
27192,GEORGE, You're not going to get back here in time!,54
27193,KRAMER," I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!",54
27194,ELAINE, You can get a hot dog in the theater.,54
27195,KRAMER, I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!,54
27196,ELAINE," Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.",54
27197,KRAMER," Well, just save me a seat.												% This touches a raw nerve.",54
27198,ELAINE," No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!												% Kramer just asks for his ticket, but George doesn't have them.",54
27199,GEORGE, I'm in line to buy.,54
27200,ELAINE," No, George, this is the ticket-<holders> line.",54
27201,GEORGE," No it's not, it's the ticket-<buyers> line.",54
27202,ELAINE, Then how come we're not moving?,54
27203,KRAMER, Good question.												% George addresses the man in front of him.,54
27204,GEORGE," Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?												% George gloats, knowing what the answer is going to be.",54
27205,GEORGE," But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!",54
27206,GEORGE," [furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.												% Misunderstanding number three. George goes to get tickets, leaving Elaine and Kramer to talk behind his back.",54
27207,ELAINE, Can you believe him?,54
27208,KRAMER," He's spaced out.												% Let him who is without sin, Kramer.",54
27209,ELAINE, How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?,54
27210,KRAMER, [thinks for a while],54
27211,ELAINE," [gives up] Yeah, exactly...												% The movie has sold out. ``Real good, George. Real good.'' It's now 10",54
27212,ELAINE, I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!,54
27213,GEORGE, It's the same movie! What's the difference?,54
27214,ELAINE," It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.												% But she gives in. New plan. George and Elaine will get tickets at the Paradise, while Kramer waits at the Paragon to tell Jerry of the change in plans. But Kramer can't keep his eye off the Papaya King sign, flashing, beckoning, practically begging... Jerry suffers through Buckles' telling of his life story in the taxi.",54
27215,JERRY, [to taxi driver] Take the Park!,54
27216,JERRY," [rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!",54
27217,GEORGE," Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.",54
27218,ELAINE, Sigh/Ugh.,54
27219,GEORGE, I wouldn't mind seein' <that>.,54
27220,ELAINE," Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.",54
27221,GEORGE," So what's your point?												% Yeah, what's your point?",54
27222,GEORGE," By the way, you owe me seven fifty.",54
27223,ELAINE," Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?",54
27224,GEORGE," No, I don't have any change.",54
27225,ELAINE," Oh, well, then I'll pay you later.",54
27226,GEORGE," Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.",54
27227,ELAINE," Yeah, you *could*...",54
27228,GEORGE, Might be easier.,54
27229,ELAINE," I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.",54
27230,GEORGE," [trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.",54
27231,ELAINE, Yeah.,54
27232,GEORGE, So... Can I have it?,54
27233,ELAINE," I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.",54
27234,GEORGE," Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?",54
27235,ELAINE, I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.,54
27236,GEORGE," I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.",54
27237,ELAINE," [exasperated] George, you're sappin' my strength.												% The line begins to move. George offers to wait outside for K+J.",54
27238,GEORGE, You go in and save seats.,54
27239,ELAINE," [in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!												% With extreme reluctance, Elaine goes on ahead to save seats.												% The taxi is stuck in traffic. Jerry bawls out Buckles for choosing 55th on a Saturday night. Buckles considers how various famous people would react to be stuck in traffic, using Jerry as an unwilling guinea pig for his material.",54
27240,JERRY," That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.",54
27241,JERRY, I gotta get out of this cab...,54
27242,JERRY," No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?",54
27243,ELAINE," No, these are saved.",54
27244,ELAINE," What, is that a rule?												% George comes in; J+K haven't appeared. Elaine sends George to the Paragon to give Kramer his and Jerry's tickets. Throughout the conversation, Elaine fends off would-be claim-jumpers.",54
27245,GEORGE," Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.",54
27246,ELAINE," [stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.												% George returns to one of his favorite topics.",54
27247,GEORGE," Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.",54
27248,ELAINE," Can we do this later, George?",54
27249,GEORGE," Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you.												% Kramer stands, mesmerized by the sign that reads, ``100% pure fresh beef. Tastier than Filet Mignon.'' He rushes to the ticket booth.",54
27250,KRAMER," Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?												% Elaine is accosted from all sides.",54
27251,ELAINE," No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!",54
27252,ELAINE, These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!												% She can't take it any longer.,54
27253,ELAINE," Oh, take 'em.												% George reaches the ticket booth of the Paragon.",54
27254,GEORGE," Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?",54
27255,GEORGE, Yeah.,54
27256,JERRY, Your trench coat in my closet?												% It's not like he's asking for a ride to the airport or anything.,54
27257,JERRY," No thanks, maybe some other time.",54

27262,KRAMER," No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.",54
27263,ELAINE," [annoyed] Excuse me, excuse me.",54
27264,ELAINE," [momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.",54
27265,GEORGE," Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?",54

27274,ELAINE, What's... medium?,54
27275,ELAINE, Oh-kay. Gimme the large.,54
27276,ELAINE, Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?,54

27331,JERRY," Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.",55
27332,ELAINE," It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.",55
27333,JERRY," Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.",55
27334,GEORGE," Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.",55
27335,GEORGE, Yeah.,55
27336,ELAINE, Hi!,55
27337,JERRY," Hey, how ya doin?",55
27338,GEORGE, You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.,55
27339,ELAINE," What, the one who just left?",55
27340,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go.",55
27341,ELAINE," Yeah, well, I guess it's all over.",55
27342,JERRY,"  Hey, is that Babu? It is!  Hey, Babu!",55
27343,JERRY," Look at you, you got the job.",55
27344,JERRY," Oh, I didn't do anything.",55
27345,JERRY, Come on.,55
27346,GEORGE," You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.",55
27347,ELAINE, No they don't.,55
27348,GEORGE," Ooooh, yes they do.",55
27349,ELAINE, Nooo.,55
27350,GEORGE," Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.",55
27351,GEORGE," You mean that's true, I'm right?!",55
27352,JERRY," Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.",55
27353,JERRY," Ok, I'll see you around the building.",55
27354,JERRY,  Remember Babu Bhatt?,55
27355,GEORGE, Who's he?,55
27356,JERRY," Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?",55
27357,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah.",55
27358,JERRY, Can you bring my mail then?,55
27359,GEORGE, What mail?,55
27360,ELAINE, I picked up his mail while he was on the road,55
27361,GEORGE, Why didn't Kramer pick it up?,55
27362,JERRY, Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.,55
27363,GEORGE," Oh yeah, right. When's he coming back?",55
27364,JERRY," Monday, I think.",55
27365,GEORGE," Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.",55
27366,JERRY," Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.",55
27367,JERRY, ...he never heard of corduroy!,55
27368,JERRY," He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.",55
27369,GEORGE," No, no I don't think so.",55
27370,ELAINE, Why?,55
27371,GEORGE, Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.,55
27372,JERRY, I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.,55
27373,GEORGE, She might not be comfortable.,55
27374,ELAINE," Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.",55
27375,JERRY, We'll be funny.,55
27376,GEORGE," No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.",55
27377,ELAINE," Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.",55
27378,JERRY," No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.",55
27379,ELAINE, Why?,55
27380,JERRY," No, it's too trendy, no Isabella's.",55
27381,GEORGE,  Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.,55
27382,GEORGE," Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.",55
27383,JERRY, Look who's here! Georgie-boy!,55
27384,GEORGE, What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?,55
27385,ELAINE," No, I talked him into it.",55
27386,GEORGE, What happened to the auto show?,55
27387,JERRY," Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.",55
27388,ELAINE, The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.,55
27389,GEORGE," Cheryl, Elaine, and uh, Jerry.",55
27390,GEORGE," Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.",55
27391,ELAINE," Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?",55
27392,GEORGE,"  No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.",55
27393,ELAINE," Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--",55
27394,GEORGE, No! No.,55
27395,ELAINE," No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?",55
27396,GEORGE,"  You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything...",55
27397,ELAINE," Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.",55
27398,ELAINE," Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.",55
27399,ELAINE, Yeah.,55
27400,JERRY, How did you know?,55
27401,ELAINE, No!,55
27402,JERRY, That's so funny!,55
27403,ELAINE, What? You're Cheryl Fong?,55
27404,ELAINE," Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!",55
27405,ELAINE," Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?",55
27406,ELAINE, Tell Ping I said hello.,55
27407,JERRY, Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.,55
27408,JERRY, What?,55
27409,GEORGE, This is not good. This is not good.,55
27410,JERRY, What's the matter?,55
27411,GEORGE, I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.,55
27412,JERRY, Why not?,55
27413,ELAINE," He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.",55
27414,JERRY, Biff?,55
27415,GEORGE, What?,55
27416,JERRY, You're not worried about that?,55
27417,GEORGE," No, of course not.",55
27418,JERRY," I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?",55
27419,ELAINE," He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.",55
27420,JERRY," Well, should we leave?",55
27421,GEORGE," Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.",55
27422,ELAINE, This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?,55
27423,JERRY," I don't have to be funny, I don't care.",55
27424,GEORGE, You don't?,55
27425,JERRY, No way! It's completely under my control.,55
27426,ELAINE," No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.",55
27427,JERRY," Of course I can, am I being funny now?",55
27428,ELAINE, A little.,55
27429,JERRY," Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?",55
27430,ELAINE, Yeah.,55
27431,JERRY," George, is this funny?",55
27432,GEORGE, It's funny!  and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.,55
27433,ELAINE, What? What did I do?,55
27434,GEORGE, Hi.,55
27435,JERRY,  Hello. Welcome back.,55
27436,ELAINE," Well, nobody likes to get old, right?",55
27437,JERRY," Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.",55
27438,GEORGE," Funny guy, huh?",55
27439,ELAINE," Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.",55
27440,JERRY," Well thank you very much, it's about time.",55
27441,ELAINE," Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.",55
27442,JERRY," Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.",55
27443,ELAINE," Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.",55
27444,JERRY,"  Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.",55
27445,JERRY, Hear that? Guess who's back.  Hey!,55
27446,KRAMER, Hey.,55
27447,JERRY, I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.,55
27448,KRAMER," Well, the camp ended a few days early.",55
27449,JERRY, Why?,55
27450,KRAMER," Uh, well there was an incident.",55
27451,JERRY, What happened?,55
27452,KRAMER, I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.,55
27453,JERRY, What?,55
27454,KRAMER," Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.",55
27455,ELAINE, You punched who in the mouth?,55
27456,KRAMER, Mickey Mantle.,55
27457,JERRY, What happened?,55
27458,KRAMER," Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.",55
27459,JERRY, Wow! Joe Pepitone!,55
27460,KRAMER," Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.",55
27461,JERRY, You plunked him.,55
27462,KRAMER," Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.",55
27463,JERRY," Wow, this is incredible!",55
27464,JERRY, What's going on out there?,55
27465,JERRY, Babu?  I'll be right back.,55
27466,ELAINE,"  Yeah, so?",55
27467,KRAMER," Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, ""Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!""",55
27468,ELAINE, So what'd you do?,55
27469,KRAMER," Well, I got the hell out of there.",55
27470,ELAINE, They took Babu away?!,55
27471,JERRY," Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.",55
27472,JERRY," I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!",55
27473,KRAMER," Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.",55
27474,JERRY,  Uh oh.,55
27475,ELAINE, What?,55
27476,JERRY, Well this is interesting.,55
27477,ELAINE, What is it?,55
27478,JERRY," It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.",55
27479,KRAMER," Well, doesn't he need that?",55
27480,JERRY," If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.",55
27481,ELAINE," Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.",55
27482,JERRY," Yeah, so am I being funny now?",55
27483,ELAINE," No, actually, you're not being funny now.",55
27484,JERRY," See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time.  Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.",55
27485,GEORGE," No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.",55
27486,JERRY," Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.",55
27487,GEORGE, What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.,55
27488,JERRY," Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.",55
27489,GEORGE," Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.",55
27490,JERRY," Ah, will you stop it already?",55
27491,GEORGE," Jerry, please?",55
27492,JERRY, How long is this gonna go on?,55
27493,GEORGE, Till I'm comfortable.,55
27494,JERRY," Well, when is that gonna be?",55
27495,GEORGE, After consummation.,55
27496,JERRY, Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.,55
27497,JERRY,  That's wonderful news. Thank you.,55
27498,JERRY," Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.",55
27499,JERRY, I don't care.,55
27500,JERRY," Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.",55
27501,JERRY," I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that.  You've been so helpful.",55
27502,ELAINE,"  Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?",55
27503,JERRY," Yeah, I'll just pay for this.",55
27504,ELAINE," Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl.  Hi.",55
27505,ELAINE," Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.",55
27506,JERRY, Babu!,55
27507,JERRY, You remember Elaine.,55
27508,ELAINE, Nice to meet you.,55
27509,JERRY," Oh, Babu.",55
27510,ELAINE, We try.,55
27511,JERRY, We do what we can.,55
27512,ELAINE, We do what we can.,55
27513,JERRY," Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.",55
27514,JERRY," Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.",55
27515,JERRY," Oh, I don't want to bother you.",55
27516,JERRY," So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.",55
27517,JERRY," You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.",55
27518,ELAINE," Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.",55
27519,JERRY, Well not technically.,55
27520,JERRY, Well what about her?,55
27521,JERRY, Babu?!,55
27522,JERRY," Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!",55
27523,JERRY," The wheels are in motion, things are happening!",55
27524,GEORGE, Jerry?,55
27525,GEORGE," You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.",55
27526,GEORGE, He can't not be funny.,55
27527,GEORGE," Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.",55
27528,GEORGE," Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.",55
27529,GEORGE," Well, should I call you later?",55
27530,GEORGE," But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!",55
27531,ELAINE," So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?",55
27532,JERRY," I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care													of it, he should be back by now.  Yeah?",55
27533,GEORGE, It's George.,55
27534,JERRY, C'mon up.,55
27535,JERRY, Babu must be back.,55
27536,JERRY, Where's Babu?,55
27537,JERRY, Who are you?,55
27538,JERRY, I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.,55
27539,ELAINE,  Snapple?,55
27540,JERRY," Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.",55
27541,GEORGE, She didn't help him?,55
27542,JERRY, No.,55
27543,GEORGE, Where is he?,55
27544,JERRY, He's in Pakistan.,55
27545,GEORGE, Oh boy.,55
27546,JERRY," What do you mean, oh boy?",55
27547,GEORGE," Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.",55
27548,JERRY," Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.",55
27549,GEORGE," What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.",55
27550,JERRY, That's because she had my mail.,55
27551,ELAINE," Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.",55
27552,KRAMER," Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.",55
27553,JERRY, How could you go in there?,55
27554,KRAMER," Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!",55
27555,JERRY," Well, what happened?",55
27556,KRAMER," I got down in my knees and went, ""Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!""",55
27557,ELAINE," So, what did he do?",55
27558,KRAMER," Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.",55
27559,KRAMER, Yeah? It's my Chinese food.,55
27560,ELAINE," Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.",55
27561,ELAINE, What?,55
27562,ELAINE, Why?,55
27563,JERRY," Yeah, it's funny!",56
27564,GEORGE," I mean, how funny is this?",56
27565,GEORGE," I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!",56
27566,JERRY," It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.",56
27567,GEORGE," Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.",56
27568,JERRY," Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.",56
27569,GEORGE," Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.",56
27570,JERRY," Right, right. Okay.  Elaine enters.",56
27571,GEORGE, Right,56
27572,JERRY,  What does she say...?,56
27573,JERRY, I don't know.,56
27574,GEORGE, I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.,56
27575,JERRY," You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.",56
27576,GEORGE," Alright, forget Elaine.",56
27577,JERRY, Alright. ,56
27578,KRAMER, Hey.,56
27579,GEORGE, Hey.,56
27580,JERRY, Hey.,56
27581,JERRY, Who?,56
27582,KRAMER, Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.,56
27583,JERRY, Did you talk to her?,56
27584,KRAMER," Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?",56
27585,JERRY, So what happened?,56
27586,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes,  ""Oh, hi! Kramer!"" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.",56
27587,JERRY," Yeah, I know about the three dates.",56
27588,KRAMER, You know what I did? I snubbed her.,56
27589,JERRY," What do you mean, you snubbed her?",56
27590,KRAMER, I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.,56
27591,KRAMER, Right by her!,56
27592,KRAMER," Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.",56
27593,JERRY," Yeah, I know.",56
27594,ELAINE," Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.",56
27595,JERRY," Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...",56
27596,ELAINE," You couldn't ""keep track"" of everybody?",56
27597,JERRY," Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh... ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.",56
27598,ELAINE, You have no idea?,56
27599,JERRY, Something derogatory? ,56
27600,JERRY," Well, Gail Cunningham.",56
27601,ELAINE," Hi, Gail.",56
27602,JERRY, Why?,56
27603,JERRY, Are you sure?,56
27604,JERRY," Nothing.  Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. ",56
27605,ELAINE, I thought you were finished.,56
27606,JERRY," I took two bites, how am I finished?  Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick?  Bite?",56
27607,JERRY," I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.",56
27608,JERRY," Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?",56
27609,JERRY," Ah, the power lunch crowd.",56
27610,ELAINE, Oh. Thank you.,56
27611,ELAINE, Really.,56
27612,JERRY, Would you care to join us?,56
27613,JERRY, See ya.,56
27614,JERRY, That bothered you?,56
27615,ELAINE," Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.",56
27616,JERRY, It did?,56
27617,ELAINE, Yes! Couldn't you see that?,56
27618,GEORGE," Yeah, I feel like I've grown.",56
27619,GEORGE," Great.  Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?",56
27620,GEORGE, You didn't like it?,56
27621,GEORGE, I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?,56
27622,GEORGE," It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?",56
27623,GEORGE, You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?,56
27624,GEORGE," Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.",56
27625,GEORGE," How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of ""com-med-dee""! You sitting here, telling people what to do.",56
27626,GEORGE," Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.'  It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!",56
27627,ELAINE, I guess she didn't think it was funny.,56
27628,GEORGE," Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!",56
27629,JERRY, I thought your mother's paying for it.,56
27630,GEORGE," And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, ""Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person.""",56
27631,ELAINE, What did I think of it? ,56
27632,ELAINE," Well, you know, I...",56
27633,KRAMER, I just kissed Gail Cunningham. ,56
27634,JERRY, You what?,56
27635,KRAMER," Yeah, I kissed her.",56
27636,JERRY, You kissed her?,56
27637,KRAMER, Right on the mouth.,56
27638,JERRY, What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?,56
27639,KRAMER," Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! ",56
27640,JERRY, And what did she do?,56
27641,KRAMER, She kissed me back.,56
27642,JERRY," I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?",56
27643,GEORGE," No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. ",56
27644,ELAINE, What? Who told you that?,56
27645,KRAMER, Gail Cunningham.,56
27646,ELAINE," I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?",56
27647,KRAMER," Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.",56
27648,JERRY, So what?,56
27649,ELAINE, So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! ,56
27650,ELAINE, Hey! Gail!,56
27651,ELAINE, Why are you talking about my shoes?,56
27652,ELAINE, My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.,56
27653,ELAINE, Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? ,56
27654,ELAINE," Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!",56
27655,JERRY, Are you alright?,56
27656,JERRY," Oh, Where did you eat?",56
27657,JERRY, Ah. I know the chef there.,56
27658,GEORGE, My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. ,56
27659,GEORGE," Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.",56
27660,JERRY," Oh, you have a daughter?",56
27661,GEORGE," Aw, that's a fun age. ",56
27662,JERRY, What?,56
27663,JERRY, What?,56
27664,GEORGE, Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...!   Do you think he liked it? ,56
27665,JERRY, I'm not sure.  What was that dish he said he had...?,56
27666,GEORGE, Pasta primavera.,56
27667,JERRY," Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'",56
27668,GEORGE, No!,56
27669,JERRY, Yeah.,56
27670,GEORGE," So, you were saying how, um...about the script...",56
27671,GEORGE, More jokes?,56
27672,JERRY, Another ending?,56
27673,GEORGE, A different name for the butler? ,56
27674,JERRY, Maybe we should go.,56
27675,GEORGE," We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. ",56
27676,JERRY," I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. ",56
27677,JERRY, Hi.,56
27678,GEORGE, Hi.,56
27679,JERRY," Oh, I'm Jerry.",56
27680,GEORGE, George.,56
27681,JERRY, We're here discussing our script with your father.,56
27682,GEORGE, He just read it. ,56
27683,GEORGE," So, you live with your mother, huh?",56
27684,JERRY, Uh huh.,56
27685,GEORGE," Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. ",56
27686,GEORGE," You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. ",56
27687,JERRY, What were you doing?,56
27688,GEORGE," Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!",56
27689,JERRY, You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.,56
27690,GEORGE," It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.",56
27691,JERRY," Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.",56
27692,GEORGE," All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.",56
27693,JERRY, That's why I poked.,56
27694,GEORGE, That's why I peeked. ,56
27695,JERRY, What?,56
27696,JERRY, She did?,56
27697,KRAMER, Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.,56
27698,GEORGE, Pasta primavera?,56
27699,JERRY, Is that what she said? ,56
27700,JERRY, She is?,56
27701,KRAMER," She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. ",56
27702,JERRY," Hello? Oh, hi Stu.",56
27703,JERRY,  Yeah.  What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks.  Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. ,56
27704,ELAINE," Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!",56
27705,GEORGE, He poked me!,56
27706,JERRY," There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex -  - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...",56
27707,ELAINE, But she was fifteen.,56
27708,JERRY," You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.",56
27709,GEORGE," Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...",56
27710,JERRY," You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.",56
27711,GEORGE," Hey, now you're onto something.",56
27712,JERRY, The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.,56
27713,GEORGE," Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine.",56
27714,JERRY, No.,56
27715,GEORGE," But...somebody like Gail, though.",56
27716,JERRY, Ya.,56
27717,ELAINE," What? What do you mean, Gail? ",56
27718,KRAMER, Yah-hey.,56
27719,JERRY," Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.",56
27720,KRAMER," Alright, I'll call her right now.",56
27721,JERRY, Ok. ,56
27722,JERRY," Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... ",56
27723,KRAMER, She said she'll do it.,56
27724,GEORGE, Beautiful.,56
27725,JERRY, Beautiful.,56
27726,ELAINE, What?,56
27727,KRAMER, She says she wants those shoes.,56
27728,ELAINE, She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!,56
27729,JERRY," No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!",56
27730,ELAINE," No, these were the last pair of these that they had!",56
27731,JERRY, I'll get you another one just like it!,56
27732,ELAINE," No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? ",56
27733,ELAINE," Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -",56
27734,GEORGE, Never mind!,56
27735,ELAINE," Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?",56
27736,KRAMER," Alright, what size are you?",56
27737,ELAINE, Seven-and-a-half.,56
27738,KRAMER, Eh! Bingo.,56
27739,JERRY, Hey! Whattaya know!,56
27740,GEORGE, Look who's here!,56
27741,JERRY, Fancy meeting you here!,56
27742,JERRY," You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.",56
27743,GEORGE, Didn't hear anything...,56
27744,JERRY, Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.,56
27745,GEORGE," Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer.  Did I leer?",56
27746,JERRY, No leer. ,56
27747,GEORGE," Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. ",56
27748,ELAINE," Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?",56
27749,ELAINE, Mmmm.,56
27750,JERRY, Really good.,56
27751,GEORGE, This pasta primavera is fabulous.,56
27752,JERRY, Very tasty.,56
27753,GEORGE, Great.,56
27754,JERRY," The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night.  Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?",56
27755,ELAINE," You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.",56
27756,JERRY," Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.",56
27757,ELAINE," Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.",56
27758,GEORGE," Well, it's a funny idea.",56
27759,JERRY, It's funny!,56
27760,GEORGE," C'mon, funny is funny.",56
27761,JERRY," Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?",56
27762,ELAINE," Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.",56
27763,JERRY, If you can.,56
27764,GEORGE," Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?",56
27765,ELAINE," Bouchard's, on 53rd. ",56
27766,JERRY," I think what he's trying to say is, ""get the bouilla-base."" ",56
27767,GEORGE, Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!,57
27768,GEORGE, You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!,57
27769,GEORGE, I'm bad. I'm *bad*!,57
27770,GEORGE, So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.,57
27771,ELAINE, Over you?,57
27772,GEORGE," Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?",57
27773,GEORGE," I got two tickets to see ""Guys And Dolls"".",57
27774,ELAINE, I got him a two-line phone.,57
27775,JERRY, Unbelievable! She's not there.,57
27776,GEORGE, What paper does she write for?,57
27777,JERRY," The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.",57
27778,ELAINE, Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...,57
27779,JERRY," Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...",57
27780,ELAINE, [Proudly] Really?,57
27781,ELAINE," Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?",57
27782,JERRY, Living or all time?,57
27783,ELAINE, All time.,57
27784,JERRY," Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.",57
27785,ELAINE, I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?,57
27786,GEORGE, Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.,57
27787,ELAINE, I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.,57
27788,ELAINE," Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.",57
27789,GEORGE," So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.",57
27790,JERRY, [indignantly] What's the matter with you?,57
27791,GEORGE," [quietly] C'mon, go along...",57
27792,JERRY, I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me,57
27793,JERRY, Y'know I hear that all the time.,57
27794,ELAINE, Hear what?,57
27795,JERRY, That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.,57
27796,ELAINE," Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.",57
27797,JERRY," Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.",57
27798,ELAINE, And you get along well with women.,57
27799,GEORGE, I guess that leaves me in the clear...													 													,57
27800,GEORGE," I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.",57
27801,JERRY," Oh yeah, what? ""Buck Naked""?",57
27802,GEORGE," Yeah, how did you know that?",57
27803,JERRY, You told me that already like two months ago.,57
27804,GEORGE, Allison bought it for me.,57
27805,JERRY, How you gonna get out of *that* one?,57
27806,GEORGE, I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.,57
27807,JERRY, He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?,57
27808,GEORGE, Jerry did you wash this pear?,57
27809,JERRY," Yeah, I washed it.",57
27810,GEORGE, It looks like it hasn't been washed.,57
27811,JERRY, So *wash* *it*.,57
27812,GEORGE, You hear the way he talks to me?,57
27813,GEORGE, Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?,57
27814,GEORGE, Jerry said he didn't like it.,57
27815,JERRY, I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...,57
27816,GEORGE," No, you said you didn't like it...",57
27817,JERRY," Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?",57
27818,JERRY," Actually, we met in the gym locker room.",57
27819,GEORGE, Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.,57
27820,JERRY, [quizzically] Live together?,57
27821,GEORGE," No, I got my own place.",57
27822,JERRY, Know *what*?,57
27823,GEORGE, My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...,57
27824,JERRY," Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!",57
27825,JERRY, There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...,57
27826,GEORGE," No, of course not...",57
27827,JERRY, I mean that's fine if that's who you are...,57
27828,GEORGE, Absolutely...,57
27829,JERRY, I mean I have many gay friends...,57
27830,GEORGE, My *father* is gay...,57
27831,JERRY, It was a *joke*...,57
27832,GEORGE," Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!",57
27833,KRAMER," Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!",57
27834,GEORGE, No!,57
27835,JERRY, No steam!,57
27836,KRAMER, Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!,57
27837,KRAMER, Happy birthday paruba!,57
27838,JERRY, Today's not my birthday.,57
27839,KRAMER," Well, I beg to differ...",57
27840,JERRY, Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!,57
27841,JERRY," Hey, where you going?",57
27842,ELAINE, I gotta go return something...,57
27843,JERRY," Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?",57
27844,GEORGE, Hey.,57
27845,JERRY," Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.",57
27846,GEORGE," So, what did she say?",57
27847,JERRY," She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...",57
27848,GEORGE, Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...,57
27849,JERRY, What are you talkin' about?,57
27850,GEORGE, I heard what you said,57
27851,JERRY," You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?",57
27852,GEORGE," Yes, I heard you!",57
27853,JERRY," Well, maybe she was disconnected.",57
27854,GEORGE, Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!,57
27855,JERRY," Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...",57
27856,KRAMER, Yello?,57
27857,JERRY," Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<",57
27858,GEORGE," ""There may be a problem with the phone, hold on""!",57
27859,JERRY," Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!",57
27860,GEORGE," ""The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye""!",57
27861,JERRY, Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?,57
27862,GEORGE," Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...",57
27863,JERRY," No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!",57
27864,ELAINE, Thank-you.,57
27865,ELAINE," So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.",57
27866,JERRY," She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.",57
27867,GEORGE," Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!",57
27868,JERRY," So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...",57
27869,GEORGE, Not at all.,57
27870,GEORGE," Two tickets to ""Guys And Dolls""! I'm gonna go with you!",57
27871,JERRY," ""Guys And Dolls""? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?",57
27872,GEORGE," It's ""Guys And *Dolls*"", not ""Guys And *Guys*"".",57
27873,JERRY," ""The Collected Works Of Bette Midler"".",57
27874,JERRY, What do you got there?,57
27875,JERRY," ""Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..."" Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been ""outed""! I wasn't even ""in""!",57
27876,GEORGE, Now everyone's going to think we're gay!,57
27877,JERRY, Not that there's anything wrong with that...,57
27878,GEORGE," No, not at all...",57
27879,JERRY," ""Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--"" *I told you that pear was washed*!",57
27880,KRAMER, I thought we were friends...,57
27881,JERRY, Here we go...,57
27882,KRAMER," I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?",57
27883,JERRY, It's not true!,57
27884,KRAMER," Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...",57
27885,JERRY, So are you...,57
27886,KRAMER, Yeah--,57
27887,GEORGE, Hello?,57
27888,GEORGE, Mrs. Seinfeld?!?,57
27889,JERRY," Oh, my God! [takes the phone] Ma?",57
27890,JERRY, Ma!,57
27891,GEORGE," Oh, my God! My *MOTHER*!!!",57
27892,JERRY," Ma, it's not true!",57
27893,JERRY," Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!",57
27894,GEORGE, It's *not* *true*!,57
27895,GEORGE, Yeah. I'm Buck Naked.,57
27896,GEORGE, Of course not...,57
27897,GEORGE," Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?",57
27898,JERRY," Y'know, I think I'll pass on the ""Guys And Dolls""...",57
27899,GEORGE, No. Just imagine her reaction.,57
27900,ELAINE, Yeah...,57
27901,GEORGE," Oh, my God...",57
27902,JERRY, What?,57
27903,GEORGE," She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!",57
27904,GEORGE, Yeah so??,57
27905,GEORGE, Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?,57
27906,GEORGE," I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.",57
27907,GEORGE, Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.,57
27908,GEORGE, You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.,57
27909,GEORGE, What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.,57
27910,JERRY," I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...",57
27911,JERRY," I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.",57
27912,GEORGE," Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!",57
27913,JERRY, What!?,57
27914,GEORGE, You're with a *woman*!,57
27915,JERRY, I know! What are you doin' here?!?,57
27916,GEORGE," I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!",57
27917,JERRY, [forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!,57
27918,GEORGE," Alright, tell her. Go ahead.",57
27919,JERRY, Tell her what?,57
27920,GEORGE, Y'know. About *us*.,57
27921,GEORGE," Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.",57
27922,KRAMER, We'll see you later...,57
27923,KRAMER, He's the *phone* man!,57
27924,KRAMER, Not that there's anything wrong with that...,57
27925,GEORGE," Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?",58
27926,JERRY," Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...",58
27927,GEORGE, Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.,58
27928,JERRY," Yeah, how about a mute?",58
27929,GEORGE, A mute would be good.,58
27930,JERRY," Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?",58
27931,GEORGE, This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.,58
27932,GEORGE," I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...",58
27933,JERRY," A deep, yawning chasm...",58
27934,GEORGE, There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?,58
27935,JERRY, Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.,58
27936,ELAINE, Hey boys!,58
27937,JERRY, Hey! How you doin'?,58
27938,ELAINE," Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.",58
27939,GEORGE, Start what?,58
27940,ELAINE, I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.,58
27941,GEORGE, *Really*.,58
27942,ELAINE," Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.",58
27943,GEORGE," Volunteer work, huh?",58
27944,JERRY, What're you gonna do down there?,58
27945,ELAINE," Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.",58
27946,JERRY, That's what I do with him [points at George],58
27947,GEORGE, When did you get this idea?,58
27948,ELAINE, Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.,58
27949,JERRY," What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?",58
27950,GEORGE, And... and anybody can do this?,58
27951,ELAINE, Yup.,58
27952,GEORGE," Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!",58
27953,ELAINE, [To Jerry] What about you?,58
27954,JERRY," Nah, it's not for me.",58
27955,ELAINE," Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.",58
27956,GEORGE, What *kind* of a person are you?,58
27957,JERRY, I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.,58
27958,GEORGE," Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.",58
27959,JERRY, Thank you.,58
27960,GEORGE," Hey, what's your guy's name again?",58
27961,JERRY, Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?,58
27962,GEORGE, Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?,58
27963,JERRY, *We*? No.,58
27964,KRAMER," So what's up, Diggity Dog?",58
27965,JERRY, George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.,58
27966,KRAMER," Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.",58
27967,JERRY, What're you talkin' about?,58
27968,KRAMER," Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!",58
27969,JERRY, What?,58
27970,KRAMER," It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*.",58
27971,JERRY, Where do you *get* this?,58
27972,KRAMER," The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.",58
27973,KRAMER, I'm in here. C'mon...,58
27974,JERRY," Hello, *Newman*...",58
27975,KRAMER, Well--,58
27976,JERRY, What records?,58
27977,KRAMER," Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.",58
27978,KRAMER," Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--",58
27979,KRAMER," Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.",58
27980,GEORGE," Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?",58
27981,GEORGE, Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?,58
27982,JERRY, Why *is* that?,58
27983,KRAMER, Five bucks???,58
27984,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] He's gyppin' us...,58
27985,KRAMER," Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.",58
27986,KRAMER, He can't even walk down the street in South America...,58
27987,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] I don't like it...,58
27988,KRAMER," [In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack.",58
27989,JERRY," Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.",58
27990,JERRY," Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?",58
27991,JERRY, Mr. Fields?,58
27992,JERRY," Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.",58
27993,JERRY," No, no, the--",58
27994,JERRY," The woman, she--",58
27995,JERRY," Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.",58
27996,JERRY," No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm--",58
27997,JERRY, What's all this stuff?,58
27998,JERRY, You're throwin' this out??,58
27999,JERRY, You don't want any of this?,58
28000,JERRY, You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.,58
28001,JERRY," Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...",58
28002,JERRY," Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.",58
28003,GEORGE," Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.",58
28004,GEORGE," You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...",58
28005,GEORGE," Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...",58
28006,GEORGE, What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!,58
28007,GEORGE," Wait a second, where are you going?",58
28008,GEORGE," Wait a minute, please--",58
28009,GEORGE," But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...",58
28010,ELAINE, Mrs. Oliver?,58
28011,ELAINE, Ooh!,58
28012,ELAINE, Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.,58
28013,ELAINE, Did you say goiter? What goiter?,58
28014,ELAINE," Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...",58
28015,ELAINE," Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.",58
28016,JERRY," C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter...",58
28017,ELAINE, I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there,58
28018,JERRY, They really should mention that in the breakdown,58
28019,ELAINE, Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.,58
28020,JERRY," Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.",58
28021,ELAINE," Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy?",58
28022,GEORGE, I don't think it's gonna work out...,58
28023,JERRY, Whattya mean?,58
28024,GEORGE, He fired me.,58
28025,JERRY, He fired you?!?,58
28026,ELAINE, *How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?,58
28027,GEORGE, I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!,58
28028,JERRY," Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.",58
28029,ELAINE, I wish I could quit...,58
28030,JERRY, So quit!,58
28031,GEORGE," Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.",58
28032,KRAMER," Well, here's your *albums* [Journey ""Escape"" is on top, BTW...]",58
28033,JERRY, What happened?,58
28034,KRAMER," Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store.",58
28035,JERRY," Oh yeah, you and your *Sergio Mendes*...",58
28036,KRAMER," Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!",58
28037,JERRY, Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away,58
28038,KRAMER," Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??",58
28039,JERRY," Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.",58
28040,KRAMER, Okay...,58
28041,KRAMER, Yeah...,58
28042,JERRY, But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.,58
28043,KRAMER," Yeah, but you've gotta come with us.",58
28044,JERRY," Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...",58
28045,GEORGE, Senegal?,58
28046,GEORGE, So you don't speak *any* English at all?,58
28047,JERRY, Well you said they could come and take the records.,58
28048,GEORGE, You don't speak *any* English?,58
28049,GEORGE, I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!,58
28050,JERRY, So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--,58
28051,KRAMER," Now calm down, Mr. Fields...",58
28052,KRAMER, Oooow! He's biting me!,58
28053,JERRY, Where's his teeth! Where's his teeth!,58
28054,GEORGE, I thought I saw something fly over here...,58
28055,JERRY, Well turn the light on...,58
28056,JERRY, That's the garbage disposal!,58
28057,ELAINE," Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...",58
28058,ELAINE, Uh huh...,58
28059,ELAINE," Well, that'll get you goin' right there...",58
28060,ELAINE," Cows, well that's fascinating...",58
28061,ELAINE, What?,58
28062,ELAINE, Ghandhi?,58
28063,ELAINE, You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O,58
28064,ELAINE," Oh, my God... The Mohatma?",58
28065,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...,58
28066,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] A piece of crap...,58
28067,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...,58
28068,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...,58
28069,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] I *loathe* you...,58
28070,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] Make us.,58
28071,JERRY," Yes, but--",58
28072,JERRY, [Into intercom] Yes?,58
28073,JERRY," Alright, c'mon up.",58
28074,JERRY," [To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.",58
28075,JERRY," Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--",58
28076,JERRY," Well, after he bit my friend--",58
28077,JERRY," I, I'm sorry.",58
28078,JERRY," Well, I brought them up there to take his records--",58
28079,KRAMER, Hey.,58
28080,JERRY, There you are. Did you find him?,58
28081,KRAMER," No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.",58
28082,KRAMER," Yeah, a real brouhaha...",58
28083,JERRY,"The cosmetic surgery procedures that are available to people today - liposuction, are you familiar with this? This is a fat-sucking machine. Now you know, somewhere, somebody is working on a way that this thing could go into a restaurant. And you could just order it off the menu. 'I tell you what, give me the cheesecake, crank me up to nine, and put a scoop of ice cream on the side.'",59
28084,JERRY," Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.",59
28085,JERRY," Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.",59
28086,JERRY," Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?",59
28087,JERRY, Alright.,59
28088,ELAINE, Good workout?,59
28089,ELAINE, That's a pretty girl.,59
28090,JERRY, Tremendous girl.,59
28091,ELAINE, She's the one you went out with last night?,59
28092,JERRY, Yeah. I really like her.,59
28093,ELAINE," You know, uh...they're fake.",59
28094,JERRY, What? Don't say that!,59
28095,ELAINE, Nah! They're fake!,59
28096,JERRY, How do you know?,59
28097,ELAINE, I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?,59
28098,JERRY," I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye.  Hi, how ya doin.' ",59
28099,ELAINE," Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?",59
28100,JERRY," Yes, they do!",59
28101,ELAINE, I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.,59
28102,JERRY, A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?,59
28103,ELAINE, No.,59
28104,JERRY," Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.",59
28105,ELAINE, I don't want to see her naked.,59
28106,JERRY," Well, I do.",59
28107,ELAINE," Well, that's your problem.",59
28108,JERRY," Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.",59
28109,ELAINE," Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?",59
28110,JERRY, Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!,59
28111,ELAINE, But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!,59
28112,JERRY," Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.",59
28113,ELAINE, What's his problem?,59
28114,JERRY," Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.",59
28115,ELAINE, Wrong side?,59
28116,JERRY," Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.",59
28117,ELAINE, He can't go left.,59
28118,JERRY," No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?",59
28119,ELAINE," Nah, we just play defense.",59
28120,GEORGE, Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?,59
28121,GEORGE, I'll shout.,59
28122,GEORGE," C'mon, c'mon... See, now, is that so bad?",59
28123,GEORGE, They'll call back.,59
28124,GEORGE," In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?",59
28125,GEORGE," Alright, maybe four.",59
28126,JERRY, You're sure?,59
28127,ELAINE, Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.,59
28128,JERRY," Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.",59
28129,ELAINE, What? Just 'cause of that?,59
28130,JERRY, Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!,59
28131,ELAINE," Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?",59
28132,JERRY," You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.",59
28133,ELAINE," You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?",59
28134,JERRY," Well, I take it very seriously.",59
28135,ELAINE," You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.",59
28136,KRAMER, Hey.,59
28137,JERRY," Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.",59
28138,KRAMER," Well, I know what they feel like.",59
28139,JERRY, You? How do you know?,59
28140,KRAMER," Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.",59
28141,KRAMER," I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.",59
28142,JERRY, Real busy now down at the office?,59
28143,KRAMER, No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.,59
28144,GEORGE, I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.,59
28145,JERRY, You put her on a pedestal.,59
28146,KRAMER, I put them on a dental chair.,59
28147,JERRY, He puts 'em on a dental chair.,59
28148,GEORGE, I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.,59
28149,KRAMER, Whoo. It's like a sauna in here.,59
28150,GEORGE, That's funny. You're a funny guy.,59
28151,JERRY," Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before.  So, you goin' to the funeral?",59
28152,GEORGE," Why, you think I should?",59
28153,JERRY," What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!",59
28154,GEORGE, I'm the consolation guy...?,59
28155,KRAMER, Consolation Guy is big.,59
28156,JERRY, Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.,59
28157,KRAMER, It's like ten dates in one shot.,59
28158,JERRY, This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!,59
28159,GEORGE," It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.",59
28160,KRAMER," Why don't you get a ""death in the family"" fare?",59
28161,GEORGE, What?,59
28162,KRAMER," You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.",59
28163,GEORGE, Really?,59
28164,KRAMER," In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!",59
28165,ELAINE," Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.",59
28166,ELAINE, Did he give you a reason?,59
28167,ELAINE, Really?,59
28168,ELAINE," Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?",59
28169,ELAINE," Oh, I know the type.",59
28170,ELAINE," Oh, yeah.",59
28171,ELAINE," Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. ",59
28172,ELAINE," So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.",59
28173,JERRY, You fell on her?,59
28174,ELAINE, I touched 'em.,59
28175,JERRY, You what?,59
28176,ELAINE, I...touched...'em.,59
28177,JERRY, You touched 'em?!,59
28178,ELAINE," I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!",59
28179,JERRY, Wow.,59
28180,ELAINE, Anyway...they're real.,59
28181,JERRY, Excuse me?!,59
28182,ELAINE, I think they might be real.,59
28183,JERRY," Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.",59
28184,ELAINE, I've touched mine!,59
28185,JERRY, So have I.,59
28186,ELAINE," Oh, right...I forgot. ",59
28187,JERRY," Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.",59
28188,ELAINE," Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.",59
28189,JERRY," Aw, what are you doin' to me? ",59
28190,KRAMER," I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...",59
28191,GEORGE," You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.",59
28192,GEORGE, I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?,59
28193,GEORGE, The death certificate?,59
28194,GEORGE, What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?,59
28195,GEORGE," You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?",59
28196,JERRY," I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!",59
28197,ELAINE," Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.",59
28198,JERRY," But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?",59
28199,ELAINE, I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!,59
28200,JERRY," Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.",59
28201,KRAMER, Hey!,59
28202,JERRY, Hey. George off to Detroit?,59
28203,KRAMER," Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.",59
28204,ELAINE," Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.",59
28205,KRAMER, Pffft - wrong.,59
28206,JERRY, There's Sidra.,59
28207,KRAMER, There's Salman.,59
28208,JERRY, Where?,59
28209,KRAMER, Talkin' to that woman.,59
28210,JERRY, Talkin' to Sidra?,59
28211,KRAMER," If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman.",59
28212,JERRY, I don't think that's Salman.,59
28213,KRAMER," Well, I don't think they're real.",59
28214,JERRY," If that's Rushdie, they're real.",59
28215,KRAMER," If they're real, that's Rushdie.",59
28216,JERRY," Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.",59
28217,KRAMER," I gotta know, I'm talkin' to Salman.",59
28218,KRAMER," It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.",59
28219,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?",59
28220,KRAMER, My name's Kramer.,59
28221,KRAMER," So, uh...what kind of work do you do?",59
28222,GEORGE," Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.",59
28223,GEORGE," Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.",59
28224,GEORGE," Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?",59
28225,KRAMER, C'mon Jerry!,59
28226,JERRY," Oh, how can you be so sure?",59
28227,KRAMER," Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!",59
28228,JERRY," Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!",59
28229,KRAMER," Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!",59
28230,JERRY," Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...",59
28231,KRAMER," What, did you ask her?",59
28232,JERRY, I'm gonna find out tonight.,59
28233,GEORGE," Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.",59
28234,GEORGE," Oh, that would be wonderful.",59
28235,GEORGE, Likewise.,59
28236,GEORGE, What?,59
28237,GEORGE, Excuse me?,59
28238,GEORGE," ""Double-dipped""? What are you talking about?",59
28239,GEORGE, So...?,59
28240,GEORGE," Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. ",59
28241,GEORGE, No.  You dip the way you want to dip... I'll dip the way I want to dip. ,59
28242,JERRY," Hey, would you mind switching seats?",59
28243,JERRY," Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.",59
28244,JERRY, How ya doin'?,59
28245,JERRY," Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.",59
28246,JERRY," Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.",59
28247,JERRY, Really?,59
28248,JERRY, How do you like that.,59
28249,JERRY," Aw, you know people.",59
28250,JERRY," Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.",59
28251,JERRY, Whatever you want me to tell them.,59
28252,JERRY, No.,59
28253,JERRY," Oh, there's no emergency...",59
28254,JERRY," Excuse me.  Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!",59
28255,KRAMER," Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.",59
28256,JERRY, This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?,59
28257,KRAMER," Well, I like yours.",59
28258,JERRY," I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.",59
28259,KRAMER," C'mon, what's wrong with my boys?",59
28260,JERRY, Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.,59
28261,KRAMER," Alright, c'mon!",59
28262,JERRY, Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. ,59
28263,ELAINE," Hi, Jer.",59
28264,JERRY," Oh, hi, Elaine.",59
28265,ELAINE," Oh...hi, Sidra -",59
28266,ELAINE, I'm looking for Kramer.,59
28267,KRAMER," Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?",59
28268,JERRY," Oh. yeah. Alright.  So, where were we?",59
28269,JERRY," Right, you were leaving.",59
28270,JERRY, That was an accident!,59
28271,GEORGE," Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. ",59
28272,GEORGE, That's a picture of me next to the coffin.,59
28273,GEORGE," Not even close, huh?",59
28274,JERRY," You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin'  Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.													 													 ",60
28275,GEORGE, You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?,60
28276,JERRY,  Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.,60
28277,GEORGE,  So when're you gonna see her?,60
28278,JERRY, Tonight.,60
28279,GEORGE, What's her name?,60
28280,JERRY, I... don't... know...,60
28281,GEORGE, How could you not know her name?,60
28282,JERRY," I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...",60
28283,JERRY, Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...,60
28284,GEORGE," Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.",60
28285,JERRY," Yeah, I did that too.",60
28286,GEORGE," Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?",60
28287,JERRY, Sure.,60
28288,GEORGE," Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!",60
28289,JERRY, Wow!,60
28290,GEORGE," Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...",60
28291,JERRY, Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.,60
28292,GEORGE, Really? Who?,60
28293,JERRY, Nobody you know...,60
28294,GEORGE, Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...,60
28295,JERRY, Why don't you put it in the *bank*?,60
28296,GEORGE, The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!,60
28297,JERRY," *Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it...",60
28298,KRAMER," Yeah... All right....Ya got it, eh.",60
28299,JERRY, Yes I did.,60
28300,KRAMER, Yes.,60
28301,GEORGE, What's with the gloves?,60
28302,KRAMER," Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...",60
28303,GEORGE," Huh. What, the whole apartment?",60
28304,KRAMER," The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood.",60
28305,JERRY, Wood is good.,60
28306,KRAMER, Definitely.,60
28307,JERRY, So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?,60
28308,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, whenever you're ready.",60
28309,JERRY," O.K., soon as Elaine gets here.",60
28310,KRAMER, Yep.,60
28311,JERRY," What, you rented ""Home Alone""?",60
28312,GEORGE, Yeah.,60
28313,JERRY, I thought you saw that already...,60
28314,GEORGE," No, I saw ""Home Alone II"".",60
28315,JERRY," Oh, right... But you *hated* it!",60
28316,GEORGE," Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?",60
28317,JERRY, What for?,60
28318,GEORGE," Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.",60
28319,JERRY, All right.. Go ahead.,60
28320,JERRY, Yeah?,60
28321,ELAINE,"  It's me, are you ready to go?",60
28322,JERRY, No. Come on up.,60
28323,KRAMER, I can't work with these!,60
28324,JERRY, What's wrong?,60
28325,KRAMER," Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...",60
28326,JERRY," You said ""gloves""...",60
28327,KRAMER," No, no, these are too thick.  ",60
28328,KRAMER," Oooh, is that ""Home Alone""?",60
28329,GEORGE, Yeah. The *original*.,60
28330,ELAINE, Hey Boys-O!,60
28331,KRAMER," Hey, how's it goin'?",60
28332,ELAINE, Hello.,60
28333,JERRY,"  Hey  get your stuff, let's get going.",60
28334,ELAINE," Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.",60
28335,JERRY, What?,60
28336,ELAINE," eh, Remember Roy, the artist?",60
28337,JERRY," Oh, the ""triangle"" guy.",60
28338,ELAINE," Yeah, exactly, the ""triangle"" guy.",60
28339,JERRY," Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?",60
28340,ELAINE," Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too...",60
28341,JERRY, Artsy?,60
28342,ELAINE, Fat.,60
28343,JERRY, Oh. ,60
28344,ELAINE," He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.",60
28345,JERRY, Yeah.,60
28346,ELAINE," Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.",60
28347,JERRY, What's wrong with him?,60
28348,ELAINE," Unh, something with his spleen.  Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way.",60
28349,KRAMER, Yeah. ,60
28350,JERRY, All right we'll wait for you.,60
28351,KRAMER," Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea.",60
28352,ELAINE," Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor?  Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.",60
28353,JERRY," Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.",60
28354,ELAINE, Well...,60
28355,JERRY, Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.,60
28356,ELAINE, Aha ha ha ,60
28357,KRAMER," All right, lets go.",60
28358,JERRY, All right ,60
28359,KRAMER, Yep yep yep.,60
28360,ELAINE, What's with him?,60
28361,JERRY, Y'know a lot of people have asked that...													 													 ,60
28362,ELAINE, Roy!,60
28363,ELAINE,"  Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so...",60
28364,ELAINE, A *lot* of weight. ,60
28365,ELAINE," Aha hu, You look *terrific*.",60
28366,ELAINE, Ah hahaha hhuu ha ,60
28367,ELAINE," Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.",60

28369,KRAMER,  Ahh.,60
28370,KRAMER," Ah, the mother lode!  													 													 ",60
28371,ELAINE, I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...,60
28372,ELAINE," Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.",60
28373,ELAINE, Me?,60
28374,ELAINE, *Get* *out*!,60
28375,ELAINE," Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks...",60
28376,JERRY, That's terrible...,60
28377,ELAINE, I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.,60
28378,JERRY, You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. ,60
28379,ELAINE," Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?",60
28380,ELAINE," Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...",60

28400,JERRY," Yeah, that's true...",60

28409,JERRY," Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.",60
28410,GEORGE," Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? ",60
28411,JERRY," Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.",60
28412,GEORGE, Oh. How's the guy?,60
28413,JERRY," Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. ",60
28414,GEORGE, Hnh. That's nerve...,60
28415,JERRY," Yeah, so she and ""Triangle Boy"" can go out to fancy restaurants. ",60
28416,GEORGE," Y'know what it is? It's ""Clara Nightingale Syndrome.""  He falls ill; she falls in love.",60
28417,JERRY, You mean Florence Nightingale. **													,60
28418,GEORGE, What'd I say? Clara?,60

28426,GEORGE," Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.",60
28427,JERRY, I will.,60
28428,GEORGE," Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.",60
28429,JERRY," No, it isn't. I can find out.",60
28430,GEORGE, Yeah? How?,60
28431,JERRY, There are ways.													 													 ,60
28432,JERRY," Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- ""Jerry Jerry Dingleberry"", and-hu ""Seinsmelled""...",60
28433,JERRY, Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?,60

28439,GEORGE," What, you should've just asked her.",60
28440,JERRY," I know, I should've asked her.",60
28441,GEORGE, What're you gonna do now?,60
28442,JERRY," I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.",60
28443,GEORGE, Aretha!  ,60
28444,JERRY, No...,60
28445,GEORGE, Bovary!  ,60

28448,JERRY, How am I gonna do that?,60
28449,GEORGE, When she goes to the bathroom.,60
28450,KRAMER," Ah,  there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?",60
28451,JERRY, You asked a date to go to the operation?,60
28452,KRAMER," Yeah... So c'mon,   what d'you say?",60
28453,GEORGE, What kind of operation is it?,60

28456,KRAMER," No No, Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah-C'mon, what d'you say?",60

28473,JERRY, I don't want any!,60
28474,KRAMER, Just take one.,60
28475,JERRY," No! Stop it! Kramer, stop it!",60
28476,JERRY,  Did it go in?,60
28477,KRAMER, Ge--,60
28478,JERRY," ...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!",60
28479,GEORGE," What do you mean ""into the patient""?",60
28480,JERRY," Into the patient, *literally*!",60
28481,GEORGE, Into the hole?,60
28482,JERRY," Yes, the hole!",60
28483,GEORGE, Didn't they notice it?,60
28484,JERRY, No!,60
28485,GEORGE, How could they not notice it?!?,60
28486,JERRY, Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.,60
28487,GEORGE, W-ca-What did they do?,60
28488,JERRY, They sealed him up with the mint inside.,60
28489,GEORGE, They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him?,60
28490,JERRY, Yes!,60
28491,GEORGE, I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.,60
28492,JERRY, Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!,60
28493,JERRY, Yeah.,60
28494,ELAINE, It's me.,60
28495,JERRY, Come on up.,60
28496,KRAMER, Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge!,60
28497,JERRY, Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!,60
28498,KRAMER," Well, I didn't believe you.",60
28499,JERRY, How could you not believe me?!?,60
28500,KRAMER," Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!",60
28501,JERRY, That's true.,60
28502,KRAMER, It's very refreshing!,60
28503,JERRY," Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...",60
28504,ELAINE, Prognosis... negative.,60
28505,JERRY, Prognosis *negative*!?,60
28506,ELAINE," He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.",60
28507,ELAINE," Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.",60
28508,GEORGE, It's that bleak? ,60
28509,ELAINE, Mmm... ,60
28510,GEORGE," Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...",60
28511,JERRY, We gotta confess.,60
28512,KRAMER, Really?,60
28513,JERRY, Yes!,60
28514,KRAMER, We could be tried for murder...,60
28515,JERRY, I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **													,60
28516,KRAMER," You're not gonna say anything, you got that?",60
28517,JERRY, I'm telling and you can't stop me!,60
28518,KRAMER, You're *not*!!!,60
28519,GEORGE," Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth.",60
28520,JERRY," Oh yeah, that's the spot...",60
28521,JERRY," Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.",60
28522,JERRY, Mulva?,60
28523,JERRY," Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse.",60
28524,JERRY, Yeah.,60
28525,JERRY," Oh, good idea...",60
28526,JERRY," Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.",60
28527,JERRY," No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah...",60
28528,KRAMER, Any news?,60
28529,JERRY," [whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.",60
28530,KRAMER, Oh.,60
28531,JERRY," Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.",60
28532,KRAMER, 10-4.,60
28533,JERRY, O.K. ,60
28534,KRAMER," Hello, I'm Kramer.",60
28535,KRAMER, See you later. ,60
28536,JERRY," Oh, okay.",60
28537,JERRY," Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.",60
28538,JERRY, Bye.,60
28539,GEORGE," Oh, Hi, I'm George. ",60
28540,GEORGE," Yeahaha, I gave it a shot ... So, any word on the ""artiste""?  ",60
28541,JERRY," No, I haven't heard anything.",60
28542,GEORGE," Hehe. Well, I got my triangles. ",60
28543,JERRY, Really...,60
28544,GEORGE," Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.",60
28545,JERRY," Yeah, I'm sure...",60
28546,JERRY," Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.",60
28547,GEORGE, No-no Jerry. I wouldn't do that.,60
28548,JERRY, Why?,60
28549,GEORGE," Ehh, You could get in trouble.",60
28550,JERRY," Look, I gotta try and help the guy.",60
28551,GEORGE," Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?",60
28552,JERRY, Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...,60
28553,GEORGE, W-What? What?,60
28554,JERRY," Oh, that's *fantastic*!",60
28555,GEORGE," He didn't get better, did he?",60
28556,JERRY, Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!,60
28557,GEORGE," Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.													 													 ",60
28558,GEORGE," Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great.  Hm hm mm.",60
28559,KRAMER," Y'know, art's a great investment.",60
28560,ELAINE," And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.",60
28561,GEORGE," Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.",60
28562,GEORGE, Yeah.,60
28563,KRAMER," Awe, alright",60
28564,JERRY, That's nice.,60
28565,GEORGE, Thanks Roy.,60
28566,JERRY, What do you mean?,60
28567,KRAMER,  Mint?,60
28568,ELAINE," Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? ",60
28569,JERRY, I don't think so...,60
28570,ELAINE," We are... that means that we ah, we are...",60
28571,JERRY, I believe we're not...,60
28572,ELAINE,"  Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?",60
28573,JERRY," Well, I'll think about it...",60
28574,JERRY, Really...,60
28575,JERRY," Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?",60
28576,JERRY, Do you have it with you?,60
28577,JERRY," Ah, Le'me see.  ",60
28578,JERRY," Yeah, I-I know...",60
28579,JERRY, Yes I do.,60
28580,JERRY, It-it rhymes with a female body part.,60
28581,JERRY, Mulva...,60
28582,JERRY," Aub, ah, Gipple?",60
28583,JERRY, Loleola?,60
28584,JERRY, Oh! Oh! *Delores*!													 ,60
28585,JERRY," Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''.  And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. ""Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.													 ",60
28586,JERRY,"JERRY: ...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something: if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.",61
28587,JERRY, Is that bothering you?,61
28588,ELAINE," No, not at all...",61
28589,ELAINE," Oh, could you please hurry?",61
28590,JERRY," [mockingly] ""Please hurry"". Look at you. Look at what you've become.",61
28591,ELAINE," What? What have I become? I haven't ""become"" anything...",61
28592,JERRY," Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?",61
28593,ELAINE, I don't want to keep him waiting...,61
28594,JERRY, He'll like you more...,61
28595,ELAINE, That's impossible...,61
28596,JERRY," Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...",61
28597,JERRY," So, where am I dropping you?",61
28598,ELAINE, His place...,61
28599,JERRY, This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...,61
28600,ELAINE, *And* he gets the rest of my chicken...,61
28601,JERRY," So, is tonight ""the night""?",61
28602,ELAINE, You never know...,61
28603,JERRY, Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*!,61
28604,JERRY," Boy, do you smell something?",61
28605,ELAINE," Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something.",61
28606,JERRY, What is it?,61
28607,ELAINE, I think it's B.O.!,61
28608,JERRY, What?,61
28609,ELAINE, It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.,61
28610,JERRY, It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.,61
28611,ELAINE, Jerry. It's *B*.*O*.,61
28612,JERRY, But the whole car smells.,61
28613,ELAINE, So?,61
28614,JERRY," So when somebody has B.O., the ""O"" usually stays with the ""B"". Once the ""B"" leaves, the ""O"" goes with it.",61
28615,ELAINE, I can't believe you ski!,61
28616,ELAINE, Yeah? What else?,61
28617,ELAINE," [delightedly] Oh! You ""pillage and plunder""?",61
28618,ELAINE," See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.",61
28619,GEORGE, This'll only take a second.,61
28620,KRAMER," Yeah, I'm going to poke around...",61
28621,GEORGE," [to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...",61
28622,GEORGE," [to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?",61
28623,GEORGE," [to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!",61
28624,GEORGE," Oh, ... some stupid movie...",61
28625,GEORGE," Oh, hi...",61
28626,GEORGE, Yes. Well...,61
28627,GEORGE, Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.,61
28628,GEORGE," Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?",61
28629,GEORGE," Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...",61
28630,GEORGE, There you go.,61
28631,GEORGE," So, uh, how long has this been going on?",61
28632,GEORGE," Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?",61
28633,GEORGE," Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.",61
28634,GEORGE," Oh, I, uh--",61
28635,GEORGE," It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.",61
28636,GEORGE," No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...",61
28637,GEORGE," Oh, that's me.",61
28638,GEORGE," Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.",61
28639,GEORGE," [embarrassed pause] ``Rochelle, Rochelle''.",61
28640,GEORGE, $3.49? It says $1.49.,61
28641,GEORGE, What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!,61
28642,KRAMER," George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.",61
28643,GEORGE, I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...,61
28644,JERRY," So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...",61
28645,ELAINE, Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.,61
28646,JERRY, What about skunk?,61
28647,ELAINE, I don't mind skunk.,61
28648,JERRY, Horse manure?,61
28649,ELAINE, I *loooove* horse manure.,61
28650,JERRY," Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.",61
28651,ELAINE, Absolutely.,61
28652,ELAINE," Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?",61
28653,JERRY, It means he's lying.,61
28654,ELAINE, Wow...,61
28655,JERRY, Why? Is that what he told you?,61
28656,ELAINE," Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...",61
28657,JERRY, No. Never.,61
28658,ELAINE, Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.,61
28659,JERRY," Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.",61
28660,ELAINE, Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?,61
28661,JERRY, Anything's *possible*...,61
28662,JERRY, What's the matter with you?,61
28663,KRAMER, Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life...,61
28664,JERRY," Oh yeah, Steinbrenner...",61
28665,KRAMER," I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...",61
28666,JERRY, I know the list...,61
28667,KRAMER, What's that smell?,61
28668,JERRY, What smell?,61
28669,KRAMER, Ooooh... You stink.,61
28670,JERRY, Whatd'ya mean I stink?,61
28671,KRAMER, You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?,61
28672,JERRY," I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!",61
28673,ELAINE, So?,61
28674,JERRY, Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!,61
28675,ELAINE," If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!",61
28676,KRAMER, What happened?,61
28677,JERRY, What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.,61
28678,GEORGE, What is that? B.O.?,61
28679,JERRY, Yeah.,61
28680,GEORGE, This is *unbelievable* B.O.,61
28681,JERRY," I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.",61
28682,GEORGE," So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?",61
28683,JERRY," No, no. It's the valet guy.",61
28684,GEORGE," No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.",61
28685,JERRY," Oh... No, that's ridiculous.",61
28686,GEORGE, What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?,61
28687,JERRY," Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism.",61
28688,GEORGE," The woman she's ""lesbianing"" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.",61
28689,GEORGE," Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!",61
28690,JERRY," There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a ""Smell Gestapo"". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...",61
28691,GEORGE," Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.",61
28692,JERRY, Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...,61
28693,JERRY," Here he is... that's the guy!  No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!",61
28694,JERRY," I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?",61
28695,GEORGE, Stinks.,61
28696,JERRY, Stinks!,61
28697,JERRY," Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!",61
28698,JERRY, That's from the car!,61
28699,GEORGE," Oh, it's the chicken and the egg...",61
28700,JERRY," Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.",61
28701,GEORGE, Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...,61
28702,JERRY, You've gotta smell the car,61
28703,JERRY, C'mon! One whiff!,61
28704,JERRY," Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?",61
28705,ELAINE," Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The ""O"" went from the valet's ""B"", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...",61
28706,ELAINE, What?,61
28707,ELAINE," No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!",61
28708,GEORGE," Listen, I gotta ask you",61
28709,GEORGE, What $98.00?,61
28710,GEORGE, How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?,61
28711,GEORGE," So, was it me?",61
28712,GEORGE," Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.",61
28713,GEORGE," Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?",61
28714,GEORGE, Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question.,61
28715,GEORGE, It's not me! It's the car!,61
28716,KRAMER, I knew you would.,61
28717,JERRY, Let's do it.,61
28718,ELAINE, Tomato Sauce?													 ,61
28719,JERRY, Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!,61
28720,JERRY, It still smells!,61
28721,GEORGE, How could it still smell after all that?,61
28722,JERRY, I don't know!,61
28723,GEORGE," Well, what are you gonna do?",61
28724,JERRY," I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!",61
28725,GEORGE, You're *selling* the car!?,61
28726,JERRY, You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.,61
28727,GEORGE, Maybe I'll buy it.,61
28728,JERRY, Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!,61
28729,ELAINE, I still smell!,61
28730,JERRY, You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!,61
28731,JERRY, Susan!,61
28732,JERRY, What is going on?,61
28733,GEORGE, He stole your girlfriend?,61
28734,GEORGE," Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.",61
28735,JERRY, That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...,61
28736,ELAINE," Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--",61
28737,KRAMER, I'm Kramer.,61
28738,GEORGE, I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?,61
28739,GEORGE, Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...,61
28740,GEORGE," Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.",61
28741,GEORGE," Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.",61
28742,GEORGE," Yeah, you're just so... hip.",61
28743,GEORGE," Oh, my God...",61
28744,GEORGE, It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.,61
28745,GEORGE," Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?",61
28746,GEORGE," Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.",61
28747,KRAMER," I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.",61
28748,JERRY, '90.,61
28749,KRAMER," Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.",61
28750,JERRY, That's strange...,61
28751,JERRY, 23 000.,61
28752,KRAMER," And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...",61
28753,JERRY, Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!,61
28754,JERRY, This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!,61
28755,ELAINE, Sauce me.,61
28756,JERRY,"JERRY: I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce: you get impeached and you're not even the president!",62
28757,GEORGE," Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?",62
28758,ELAINE, We don't walk that fast...,62
28759,GEORGE, No seriously...,62
28760,ELAINE," Seriously, we don't.",62
28761,GEORGE," The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.",62
28762,ELAINE,"  Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!",62
28763,ELAINE," Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?",62
28764,JERRY," Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.",62
28765,GEORGE, I gotta buy a present now?,62
28766,ELAINE," Of course you do, it's an engagement party.",62
28767,GEORGE," It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.",62
28768,JERRY, You don't like the Drake?,62
28769,GEORGE, Hate the Drake.,62
28770,ELAINE, I *love* the Drake.,62
28771,JERRY, How could you not like the Drake?,62
28772,GEORGE, Who's the Drake?,62
28773,ELAINE," ""Who's the Drake""?",62
28774,JERRY, The Drake is good!,62
28775,ELAINE," So listen, what are you gonna get him?",62
28776,GEORGE, I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! ,62
28777,JERRY," Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!",62
28778,ELAINE, So what? That's easy.,62
28779,JERRY, Easy?,62
28780,ELAINE," Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?",62
28781,KRAMER," Uh, no, no, not yet.",62
28782,JERRY, Do you like the Drake?,62
28783,KRAMER, I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!,62
28784,ELAINE, I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.,62
28785,KRAMER,  That's a nice triangle...,62
28786,JERRY, It's Isosceles,62
28787,KRAMER," Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.",62
28788,ELAINE," Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.",62
28789,JERRY, The chip-in!,62
28790,ELAINE," Hey, a pretty good idea, huh?",62
28791,JERRY, Yeah!,62
28792,KRAMER," Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely!",62
28793,JERRY," You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.",62
28794,KRAMER," No, no! My car's not running.",62
28795,JERRY, What about your father's car?,62
28796,GEORGE," No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.",62
28797,JERRY, Are you serious?,62
28798,GEORGE," You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.",62
28799,JERRY," How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!",62
28800,GEORGE, Good thinking!,62
28801,JERRY, Good to meet you!,62
28802,ELAINE, So what are we gonna get him?,62
28803,JERRY," We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.",62
28804,GEORGE, I like this area. I could live out here.,62
28805,KRAMER," Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.",62
28806,JERRY," Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.",62
28807,GEORGE," Look at this. There's no spaces here.  Excuse me, are you gettin' out?",62
28808,KRAMER, Why don't you take a handicap spot...,62
28809,GEORGE, You think?,62
28810,ELAINE," No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.",62
28811,GEORGE, I don't want to walk that far.,62
28812,ELAINE, What if a handicapped person needs it?,62
28813,KRAMER," Oh, come on, they don't drive!",62
28814,JERRY," Yes, they do!",62
28815,KRAMER, Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?,62
28816,JERRY," Well there's spaces there, they must drive!",62
28817,KRAMER," Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.",62
28818,ELAINE," So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?",62
28819,GEORGE," Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the ""party""!",62
28820,KRAMER, I got news for you,62
28821,GEORGE," He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?",62
28822,ELAINE, What does that mean?,62
28823,GEORGE," Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in.",62
28824,KRAMER," Yeah, go ahead.",62
28825,ELAINE, George!,62
28826,GEORGE," Oh, come on, it's five minutes.",62
28827,KRAMER, Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.,62
28828,JERRY, Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?,62
28829,ELAINE," What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...",62
28830,GEORGE," What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...",62
28831,JERRY," No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!",62
28832,ELAINE, Got to *love* the Drake!,62
28833,JERRY," Hey, what's going on over here?",62
28834,ELAINE, Must have been an accident...,62
28835,JERRY,"  Hey, what's going on?",62
28836,JERRY, Is she OK?,62
28837,JERRY," Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.",62
28838,GEORGE, How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!,62
28839,ELAINE,  Are you happy now?,62
28840,KRAMER, Who would think these people we're gonna be here?,62
28841,JERRY, I don't know...,62
28842,ELAINE, What about the party? What about the Drake?,62
28843,GEORGE, Screw the Drake!,62
28844,JERRY, I love the Drake!,62
28845,KRAMER, Let's just take a bus back to the city.,62
28846,GEORGE, Can't leave the car here!,62
28847,KRAMER, Why not?,62
28848,GEORGE, It's my father's car!,62
28849,JERRY, Let's get out of here.,62
28850,GEORGE, What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?,62
28851,JERRY," The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?",62
28852,ELAINE," Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?",62
28853,JERRY," What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...",62
28854,GEORGE," What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!",62
28855,KRAMER, You'd think...,62
28856,GEORGE," I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?",62
28857,KRAMER, Most of them don't even have batteries.,62
28858,GEORGE," Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.",62
28859,KRAMER, Yeah...,62
28860,GEORGE," Well, I'm sorry!",62
28861,ELAINE, Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...,62
28862,GEORGE, How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!,62
28863,JERRY, I got it!  We give the keys to Elaine.,62
28864,ELAINE, Me?,62
28865,JERRY, Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!,62
28866,ELAINE," Oh, they won't?",62
28867,JERRY, Not if they don't know you...,62
28868,ELAINE," I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!",62
28869,KRAMER, No chance in hell!,62
28870,JERRY, What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming,62
28871,GEORGE," That's good, we'll give it a try...",62
28872,ELAINE, That's good...,62
28873,JERRY," That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!",62
28874,KRAMER, Huh?,62
28875,JERRY,"  You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...",62
28876,GEORGE," Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!",62
28877,GEORGE, I'm uh... writing a pilot for NBC...,62
28878,GEORGE," Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge													sentences him to be Jerry's butler.",62
28879,GEORGE," Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...",62
28880,JERRY,"  So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome...  They loved the TV, *loved* it!",62
28881,ELAINE," Oh, yeah...",62
28882,JERRY,"  Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea.  Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?",62
28883,ELAINE, Sure!,62
28884,JERRY,"  Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...",62
28885,JERRY, The Drake is great!,62
28886,ELAINE, Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.,62
28887,JERRY," Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.",62
28888,JERRY, Yes?,62
28889,GEORGE, It's me.,62
28890,JERRY, Come on up.,62
28891,KRAMER, Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeth's.,62
28892,JERRY, St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?,62
28893,KRAMER," Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.",62
28894,ELAINE, You went to see her?,62
28895,KRAMER, Yeah.,62
28896,JERRY," Wow, what happened?",62
28897,KRAMER, I'm in love.,62
28898,JERRY, What?,62
28899,KRAMER," Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.",62
28900,JERRY," Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.",62
28901,KRAMER," Ah, I'm glad you're here.",62
28902,GEORGE, What?,62
28903,KRAMER," Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.",62
28904,GEORGE, A wheelchair? What for?,62
28905,KRAMER," Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!",62
28906,GEORGE, Doesn't she have collision?,62
28907,KRAMER," George, I'm in love with her!",62
28908,GEORGE," Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.",62
28909,KRAMER, No! She needs it now!,62
28910,GEORGE, What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?,62
28911,KRAMER, Well...,62
28912,ELAINE," Hey, we told you not to park there!",62
28913,GEORGE, Can't we just fix the old one?,62
28914,KRAMER," Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?",62
28915,GEORGE," Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!",62
28916,KRAMER," So now, what's this got?",62
28917,GEORGE, How much?,62
28918,GEORGE, Do you have something a little more... less expensive?,62
28919,JERRY,"Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!",62
28920,ELAINE," My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?",62
28921,JERRY," I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....",62
28922,ELAINE," Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?",62
28923,JERRY, So where're we eatin'?,62
28924,ELAINE, I'm *really* hungry!,62
28925,JERRY, When did this happen?,62
28926,JERRY,  Look at the picture on this thing...,62
28927,ELAINE," Oh, cristal clear!",62
28928,JERRY, They know how to make 'em...,62
28929,ELAINE, Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?,62
28930,JERRY, Well... we should...,62
28931,ELAINE, Get movin'...,62
28932,JERRY," Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.",62
28933,ELAINE, Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!,62
28934,ELAINE," Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...",62
28935,KRAMER, But this'll get you around?,62
28936,GEORGE, Like what?,62
28937,KRAMER, Now what's that?,62
28938,KRAMER," Well, is it alright if I try it?",62
28939,KRAMER, Oh yeah!,62
28940,GEORGE, How much?,62
28941,ELAINE, Drake gave her the TV?,62
28942,JERRY, He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.,62
28943,ELAINE," Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!",62
28944,JERRY, I know it is!,62
28945,ELAINE," Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!",62
28946,JERRY, I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.,62
28947,ELAINE, They don't know anybody in Chicago.,62
28948,JERRY," Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.",62
28949,GEORGE, Hey.,62
28950,JERRY," Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up.",62
28951,JERRY, I don't know about defraying.,62
28952,GEORGE, Why?,62
28953,JERRY, We're not gettin' that TV.,62
28954,GEORGE," What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.",62
28955,ELAINE, The Drakette took it.,62
28956,GEORGE," She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.",62
28957,ELAINE," Well, she has it!",62
28958,GEORGE,  I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!,62
28959,GEORGE, Maybe we should call her.,62
28960,ELAINE," Well, who's gonna call?",62
28961,JERRY, You are.,62
28962,ELAINE, What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?,62
28963,JERRY, Because that's your thing!,62
28964,ELAINE," What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my ""thing""?",62
28965,JERRY," Yeah, that's your thing.",62
28966,ELAINE," Alright, gimme the phone... it's my ""thing""...",62
28967,JERRY,"  You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.",62
28968,GEORGE, Really?,62
28969,JERRY, Yeah.,62
28970,GEORGE, I could see that...,62
28971,ELAINE," Alison! Hi, this is Elaine...",62
28972,ELAINE," Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...",62
28973,ELAINE, Everybody does. Bye-bye....,62
28974,ELAINE, She gave it to charity.,62
28975,JERRY, Charity?!? That's apalling.,62
28976,GEORGE, How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!,62
28977,KRAMER," Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!",62
28978,GEORGE, You mean a blessing in disguise?,62
28979,KRAMER, Yeah....,62
28980,JERRY, Your father got arrested? For what?,62
28981,GEORGE," Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.",62
28982,JERRY, Ho-ly!,62
28983,GEORGE," Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...",62
28984,JERRY, So what are you gonna do?,62
28985,GEORGE, I agreed to become his butler.,62
28986,JERRY, What?,62
28987,JERRY, What's the matter?,62
28988,KRAMER, It's over!,62
28989,JERRY, What's over?,62
28990,KRAMER, Me and Lola....,62
28991,GEORGE, The woman we bought the wheelchair for?,62
28992,KRAMER," Yeah, she dumped me!",62
28993,JERRY, She dumped you?,62
28994,KRAMER, She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?,62
28995,KRAMER," Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?",62
28996,GEORGE, ...you're very attractive...,62
28997,KRAMER, yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!,62
28998,JERRY, Drop dead?,62
28999,GEORGE," Boy, even I never heard that one...",62
29000,JERRY, She's pretty rough!,62
29001,KRAMER, Yeesh-jip!,62
29002,GEORGE," Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.",62
29003,JERRY, 240 bucks?,62
29004,GEORGE," Well, it was slightly used...",62
29005,JERRY, Used?,62
29006,GEORGE, What!?,62
29007,GEORGE, Sons of bitches!,62
29008,GEORGE, Big screen TV?,62
29009,GEORGE," Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.",62
29010,KRAMER," Ooh, it's a big one!",62
29011,GEORGE, Who's got the receipt?,62
29012,ELAINE, I do.,62
29013,GEORGE, Will they give us cash?,62
29014,JERRY, That's their policy.,62
29015,GEORGE," I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...",62
29016,KRAMER, Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?,62
29017,GEORGE, What if there is a fire?,62
29018,KRAMER, What are the chances of that?,62
29019,JERRY," To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go",63
29020,KRAMER, Why can't I play Kramer?,63
29021,JERRY, Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!,63
29022,KRAMER, Neither are you.,63
29023,JERRY, I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?,63
29024,KRAMER," Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.",63
29025,JERRY, My grandmother's in the hospital.,63
29026,KRAMER, Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!,63
29027,JERRY, This is real believable.,63
29028,KRAMER, What you didn't think I was really laughing?,63
29029,JERRY, It stinks.,63
29030,KRAMER, Let me see you do it.,63
29031,JERRY, Say something funny.,63
29032,KRAMER, Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.,63
29033,JERRY, Ah..........,63
29034,KRAMER, Mine was better than that! Come on look. ,63
29035,GEORGE, Why are two pretending to be laughing?,63
29036,JERRY, We're acting. ,63
29037,GEORGE," Oh, real good.  Any word from NBC?",63
29038,JERRY, No.,63
29039,GEORGE, I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.,63
29040,KRAMER,  Well at least let me audition.,63
29041,JERRY,  He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.,63
29042,KRAMER,  Yeah!,63
29043,GEORGE, Out of the question.,63
29044,KRAMER, Oughh!,63
29045,GEORGE,  How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? ,63
29046,ELAINE," Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...",63
29047,ELAINE, That was two months ago.,63
29048,ELAINE," Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. ",63
29049,ELAINE," God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things .",63
29050,ELAINE," Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.",63
29051,ELAINE," Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that ""Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?"" guy.",63
29052,ELAINE, Really? What is it about?,63
29053,ELAINE,  What do you mean it's about nothing?,63
29054,ELAINE," Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.",63
29055,ELAINE," Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work . So...",63
29056,ELAINE, I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. .,63
29057,JERRY, Hello? Yeah he's here.  Hey! It's for you.,63
29058,GEORGE, He's getting phone calls here now? ,63
29059,JERRY,  Again with the sweat pants?,63
29060,GEORGE, What? I'm comfortable.,63
29061,JERRY, You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world,63
29062,KRAMER,"  Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. ",63
29063,JERRY,  Who is it?,63
29064,KRAMER, That's NBC.,63
29065,JERRY, NBC!?! Give me the phone!,63
29066,KRAMER, I'm in the middle of a conversation here.,63
29067,JERRY, Get off the phone!,63
29068,KRAMER,"  Look, I'll call you back. ",63
29069,JERRY, You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?,63
29070,KRAMER, Russell Dalrimple's secretary.,63
29071,JERRY, All right. Now you're doing something to help me.  Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot.  Casting tomorrow at NBC. 4,63
29072,GEORGE, What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?,63
29073,GEORGE," Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.",63
29074,GEORGE, I do for the bad things.,63
29075,GEORGE, What?,63
29076,GEORGE,"  Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.",63
29077,GEORGE, Better get that checked out?,63
29078,GEORGE," What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?",63
29079,GEORGE," What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. ",63
29080,GEORGE, Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! ,63
29081,JERRY, Where?,63
29082,GEORGE, Right here. ,63
29083,JERRY," Get out of here, it's nothing. ",63
29084,GEORGE,"  Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?",63
29085,GEORGE," Oh, my God.",63
29086,GEORGE,  It's all white Jerry! It's all white!,63
29087,JERRY, Would you stop?,63
29088,GEORGE," Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.",63
29089,JERRY," If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.",63
29090,GEORGE, Catch what in time?,63
29091,JERRY, Whatever it is.,63
29092,GEORGE, You think it's something?,63
29093,JERRY,  You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.,63
29094,GEORGE,  What do you think it is?,63
29095,JERRY," Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.",63
29096,GEORGE, Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?,63
29097,JERRY,  They've gotta be kidding.,63
29098,GEORGE,  This guy's perfect.,63
29099,JERRY, Everything all right?,63
29100,GEORGE," No, not a loser!",63
29101,JERRY, No you didn't. He knows he's bald.,63
29102,JERRY,"  Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.",63
29103,JERRY," Alright, want to start?",63
29104,JERRY, O.K.,63
29105,JERRY, What look?,63
29106,JERRY, I gave a look?,63
29107,GEORGE, Thank you! Thank you very much. ,63
29108,JERRY,  Good.,63
29109,GEORGE, Very nice,63
29110,JERRY, Very good,63
29111,GEORGE," Very nice Tom, that was terrific.",63
29112,GEORGE, Sure. Thank you for coming in. ,63
29113,JERRY,  It was a wonderful reading.,63
29114,GEORGE, Yeah. Really.,63
29115,GEORGE, Take care. Take it easy. ,63
29116,JERRY," Yeah, I liked him.",63
29117,GEORGE, What happened to the raisins?,63
29118,GEORGE, Did he just steal the raisins?,63
29119,JERRY,  What are you doing here?,63
29120,KRAMER, That's true.,63
29121,KRAMER,"  I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in.  Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?",63
29122,KRAMER, Yeah. Be right back. ,63
29123,ELAINE, So who's playing Elaine?,63
29124,JERRY," Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.",63
29125,ELAINE, Really?,63
29126,JERRY, Yes.,63
29127,ELAINE, Who is it?,63
29128,JERRY," She's an eskimo, actually.",63
29129,ELAINE," Oh, my God ",63
29130,JERRY," She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.",63
29131,ELAINE," Listen, was Russell at the casting?",63
29132,JERRY," No, he didn't show up.",63
29133,ELAINE," You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?",63
29134,JERRY, No. No you're not.,63
29135,ELAINE, Why do I keep setting you up?,63
29136,JERRY, I don't know.,63
29137,ELAINE,"  Could we get a little more?  Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.",63
29138,JERRY, Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?,63
29139,ELAINE, Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.,63
29140,JERRY, Beside that. Look at the waitresses.,63
29141,ELAINE, Yeah? ,63
29142,JERRY, What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?,63
29143,ELAINE, Ah...,63
29144,JERRY, I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?,63
29145,ELAINE," Yes, I would say.",63
29146,JERRY, What's going on here. How is that possible?,63
29147,ELAINE, Do you think it's a coincidence?,63
29148,JERRY, No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.,63
29149,ELAINE,  Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?,63
29150,ELAINE," You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?",63
29151,JERRY, Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.,63
29152,GEORGE," You see, It's right here. It's all white...",63
29153,GEORGE, You've never seen this before?,63
29154,GEORGE,  A what?,63
29155,GEORGE, A biopsy?,63
29156,GEORGE, Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?,63
29157,GEORGE, A biopsy!,63
29158,JERRY, What did he say?,63
29159,GEORGE, He said he didn't know what it was.,63
29160,JERRY, Alright. So?,63
29161,GEORGE," When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a ""get outta here"". That's what I wanted to hear",63
29162,JERRY," Well, maybe he doesn't have a ""get outta here"" kind of personality.",63
29163,GEORGE," How could you be a doctor and not say ""get outta here""? It should be part of the training at medical school",63
29164,JERRY, Can't you at least die with a little dignity?,63
29165,GEORGE, No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?,63
29166,JERRY, Hey. What happened to you yesterday?,63
29167,KRAMER, I got mugged.,63
29168,GEORGE, You got mugged?,63
29169,JERRY, Mugged?,63
29170,KRAMER," Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.",63
29171,JERRY, Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?,63
29172,KRAMER," It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...",63
29173,JERRY, Yeah?,63
29174,ELAINE, It's me.,63
29175,JERRY, Come on up.,63
29176,KRAMER," But now I have a big problem, buddy.",63
29177,JERRY, What is it?,63
29178,KRAMER," Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.",63
29179,JERRY, You didn't go?,63
29180,KRAMER, No. And now I can't get it back.,63
29181,JERRY, The % thing to do is just not think about it.,63
29182,KRAMER, How could you not think about it?,63
29183,ELAINE, Hey.,63
29184,KRAMER, ,63
29185,ELAINE, What's the matter with him?,63
29186,JERRY, He's a little backed up.,63
29187,ELAINE, Oh...,63
29188,GEORGE, Elaine.,63
29189,ELAINE, So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.,63
29190,JERRY," Oh, the sisters ",63
29191,GEORGE,  Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.,63
29192,ELAINE, So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.,63
29193,GEORGE, Apply for a job? What for?,63
29194,ELAINE," Because, it's discriminatory ",63
29195,GEORGE, It's a coincidence.,63
29196,JERRY, This is what you gonna wear?,63
29197,ELAINE, Yeah.,63
29198,JERRY, You're not gonna get the job.,63
29199,ELAINE, Exactly.,63
29200,JERRY,"  Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. ",63
29201,ELAINE, Who was it?,63
29202,JERRY, TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.,63
29203,ELAINE, What about the dogs?,63
29204,JERRY, They're having sex in the hotel room.,63
29205,JERRY, Yes.,63
29206,JERRY," Uh, Huh, yeah.",63
29207,JERRY," Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.",63
29208,JERRY, With her hands.,63
29209,JERRY, Also with her hands.,63
29210,JERRY, Everything?,63
29211,JERRY, All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.,63
29212,JERRY, Shaft.,63
29213,JERRY, She likes talking during sex.,63
29214,JERRY," No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- ",63
29215,JERRY, What?,63
29216,JERRY, All right. Elaine.,63
29217,JERRY, Well--,63
29218,JERRY," Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--",63
29219,JERRY, I think you got it.,63
29220,KRAMER," I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look.  Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down...  Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.",63
29221,KRAMER," Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.",63
29222,KRAMER, You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.,63
29223,KRAMER," Whoa, I'm Kramer.",63
29224,ELAINE," No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.",63
29225,ELAINE," Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.",63
29226,ELAINE, You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. ,63
29227,ELAINE," Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.",63
29228,ELAINE," Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.",63
29229,ELAINE," Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.",63
29230,ELAINE, Hi.,63
29231,JERRY, It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.,64
29232,JERRY, No I'm not.  George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?,64
29233,GEORGE,  This guy stinks. ,64
29234,JERRY, Danish. Is it from Denmark?,64
29235,GEORGE," Uh, excuse me.  Excuse me.  This--This is not right. May I?  You see, you're going",64
29236,GEORGE, Just a suggestion. ,64
29237,GEORGE,  Yep. That's five!,64
29238,JERRY," George?  I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.",64
29239,GEORGE, Why is that?,64
29240,JERRY," I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?",64
29241,GEORGE," Oh, you're fine... you're fine.  So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?",64
29242,JERRY, Why would he steal a box of raisins?,64
29243,GEORGE," Yeah, it's bizarre. ",64
29244,JERRY, Nothing.,64
29245,JERRY, No.,64
29246,JERRY, Are we going out?,64
29247,JERRY, Do you want me to break up with you?,64
29248,JERRY, I don't even know what you're talking about.,64
29249,JERRY, All right. We're broken up.,64
29250,GEORGE, Remember when you came to audition for us?,64
29251,GEORGE," There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?",64
29252,GEORGE," Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know , maybe you took them with you.",64
29253,GEORGE," Oh, no, no--",64
29254,GEORGE," No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. ",64
29255,GEORGE, Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that.  Good talking to you Tom. Really.,64
29256,GEORGE, The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.,64
29257,JERRY, Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.,64
29258,GEORGE, What do you mean?,64
29259,JERRY, Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!,64
29260,GEORGE, Come on you're... uh... you're fine.,64
29261,JERRY, This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.,64
29262,GEORGE, What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.,64
29263,JERRY," This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.",64
29264,GEORGE, The guy playing Kramer threatened me.,64
29265,JERRY, Why?,64
29266,GEORGE, 'cause I asked him about the raisins.,64
29267,JERRY, You mentioned the raisins.,64
29268,GEORGE, Oh yeah.,64
29269,JERRY, Did he take 'em?,64
29270,GEORGE, I don't know.,64
29271,JERRY," Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?",64
29272,GEORGE, That's what I'm trying to find out.,64
29273,JERRY, Hey.,64
29274,KRAMER, Hey.,64
29275,JERRY, Any luck?,64
29276,KRAMER," No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis.",64
29277,JERRY, What about bran?,64
29278,KRAMER," I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.",64
29279,JERRY," Well my friend,  it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.",64
29280,KRAMER," Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.",64
29281,JERRY," Oh, it's not that bad!",64
29282,GEORGE, Yes it is.,64
29283,ELAINE, Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.,64
29284,JERRY,"  So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?",64
29285,ELAINE, No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.,64
29286,JERRY," Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.",64
29287,ELAINE," Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.",64
29288,JERRY, We need you there!,64
29289,ELAINE,  Hey are you gonna go?,64
29290,KRAMER, No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. ,64
29291,JERRY, Try Elaine.,64
29292,ELAINE," Oh, right.",64
29293,JERRY," Just relax, you'll be fine.",64
29294,JERRY, You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!,64
29295,GEORGE," This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. ",64
29296,GEORGE,"  Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.",64
29297,JERRY," Good evening, folks. How you doing?  Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--",64
29298,GEORGE," Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?",64
29299,JERRY," Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.",64
29300,GEORGE, Really? What does it mean?,64
29301,JERRY, It means,64
29302,GEORGE, I can see that.,64
29303,ELAINE," See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?",64
29304,JERRY," No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?",64
29305,ELAINE," Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.",64
29306,GEORGE," Yeah, me too.",64
29307,JERRY," Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?",64
29308,ELAINE, No.,64
29309,JERRY, Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...,64
29310,KRAMER," Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!",64
29311,JERRY," Well, well, well.",64
29312,ELAINE, Congratulations.,64
29313,KRAMER," Well, thank you.",64
29314,GEORGE," You went for the big ""E"".",64
29315,KRAMER, Wet and wild.,64
29316,JERRY, All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.,64
29317,KRAMER," Oh, yes.",64
29318,ELAINE," Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet.",64
29319,JERRY, A wallet? Let me see that.,64
29320,ELAINE, Here.,64
29321,JERRY," Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.",64
29322,GEORGE, Shh! This is it!,64
29323,JERRY, How do you like that?,64
29324,JERRY,"How 'bout that seedless watermelon? What an invention, scientists are working on this. You know other scientists devote their lives to fighting cancer, aids, heart disease. These guys are goin' 'No, I'm focusing on melon. Oh sure thousands of people are dying needlessly. But this  that's gotta stop. You ever try to pick a wet one up off the floor? It's almost impossible I'm devoting my life to that.' So I guess if they can get rid of the seeds the rind is goin' next. What do we need that for? Get rid of the rind. They're not going to stop till they're making in the ground ready to eat fruit cups, growin' right out of the ground.",65
29325,JERRY," So, what's her name?",65
29326,GEORGE, Karen.,65
29327,JERRY, Is she nice?,65
29328,GEORGE, Great.,65
29329,JERRY, So you like her?,65
29330,GEORGE, I think so.,65
29331,JERRY, You don't know?,65
29332,GEORGE, I can't tell anymore.,65
29333,JERRY, Well do you feel anything?,65
29334,GEORGE, Feel? What's that?,65
29335,JERRY," All right, let me ask you this",65
29336,GEORGE, Yeah.,65
29337,JERRY, You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?,65
29338,GEORGE, Cleaning,65
29339,JERRY, You do the tub?,65
29340,GEORGE, Yeah.,65
29341,JERRY," On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?",65
29342,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah.",65
29343,JERRY," Okay, I think you're in love!",65
29344,GEORGE, Tub is love?,65
29345,JERRY, Tub is love.,65
29346,GEORGE, Hah.,65
29347,JERRY, So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.,65
29348,GEORGE, Yep. There's one liiiittle problem.,65
29349,JERRY, Sexual?,65
29350,GEORGE, Yeeeaaah.  Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.,65
29351,JERRY, Below the equator?,65
29352,GEORGE, Yeah.,65
29353,JERRY," Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.",65
29354,GEORGE, I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.,65
29355,JERRY, You got the tap?,65
29356,GEORGE," You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. . You know it's like pfffff , all right that's enough, you're through.",65
29357,JERRY, The tap is tough.,65
29358,GEORGE, It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.,65
29359,JERRY, Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.,65
29360,GEORGE," No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.",65
29361,JERRY, It's a very complicated area.,65
29362,GEORGE, You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.,65
29363,JERRY, It's a haaazy mystery.,65
29364,GEORGE," Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.",65
29365,ELAINE, Who's faking?,65
29366,GEORGE, Nothing.,65
29367,ELAINE, Faking what?,65
29368,GEORGE, Nobody's faking.,65
29369,ELAINE, Ah! Orgasm?,65
29370,GEORGE, She's not faking!,65
29371,ELAINE, How do you know?,65
29372,GEORGE," I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?",65
29373,ELAINE, Of course.,65
29374,JERRY, Really?,65
29375,GEORGE, You faked?,65
29376,ELAINE, On occasion.,65
29377,JERRY, And the guy never knows?,65
29378,ELAINE, No.,65
29379,JERRY, How can he not know that?,65
29380,ELAINE, Because I was gooood.,65
29381,JERRY, I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.,65
29382,ELAINE, You didn't know.,65
29383,JERRY, What?,65
29384,ELAINE, You didn't know.,65
29385,JERRY, Are you saying...,65
29386,GEORGE, I think I'll have a piece of cake.,65
29387,JERRY, With me?,65
29388,ELAINE, Well...,65
29389,JERRY, You faked with me?,65
29390,ELAINE, Ye.,65
29391,JERRY, You faked with me?,65
29392,ELAINE, Yeass.,65
29393,JERRY, No.,65
29394,ELAINE, Yeass.,65
29395,JERRY, You faked it?,65
29396,ELAINE, I faked it.,65
29397,JERRY," That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?",65
29398,ELAINE, Not bad huh?,65
29399,JERRY," What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?",65
29400,ELAINE,"  Fake, fake, fake, fake.",65
29401,JERRY," I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?",65
29402,ELAINE," Uuuhm, all the time.",65
29403,JERRY, All the time?!,65
29404,GEORGE, We got a chocolate malt in here!,65
29405,JERRY, But I'm so good.,65
29406,GEORGE, I'm sure you are.,65
29407,ELAINE," Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.",65
29408,JERRY, She faked.,65
29409,JERRY, Maybe they've all been faking.,65
29410,ELAINE, I'm sure they're not.,65
29411,GEORGE, Maybe Karen is faking.,65
29412,KRAMER, She was probably joking.,65
29413,JERRY," No no, it was no joke.",65
29414,KRAMER, She didn't have any?,65
29415,JERRY, No. None.,65
29416,KRAMER,  She faked 'em all.,65
29417,JERRY,  Faked 'em all.,65
29418,KRAMER," Well so she faked 'em, so what?",65
29419,JERRY, The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.,65
29420,KRAMER, You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.,65
29421,JERRY," How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.",65
29422,KRAMER, Yeah I could have helped you out.,65
29423,JERRY, What could you have done?,65
29424,KRAMER, I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.,65
29425,JERRY, I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.,65
29426,KRAMER, Aaaaah.,65
29427,JERRY, Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.,65
29428,KRAMER, Giddy-up.,65
29429,JERRY, Hello... Oh hello Elaine.,65
29430,ELAINE, So we're having dinner tonight?,65
29431,JERRY," I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.",65
29432,ELAINE, Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?,65
29433,JERRY," What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.",65
29434,ELAINE," Nooo, the other thing.",65
29435,JERRY, Oooh that. Well...,65
29436,ELAINE," Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.",65
29437,JERRY, Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?,65
29438,ELAINE, Okay.,65
29439,JERRY, All right.,65
29440,ELAINE," All right, see you later.",65
29441,JERRY, Bye.,65
29442,ELAINE, Bye.,65
29443,ELAINE," Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something",65
29444,ELAINE," Really, like when?",65
29445,JERRY, I really don't feel like seeing her.,65
29446,KRAMER," You know, I faked it.",65
29447,JERRY,  What?!,65
29448,KRAMER, Yeah.,65
29449,JERRY, You faked it? Why would you do that?,65
29450,KRAMER," Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.",65
29451,JERRY," Yeah, but why would you...  Bad peach?",65
29452,KRAMER, It's terrible!,65
29453,JERRY, Did you get that at Joe's?,65
29454,KRAMER," Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.",65
29455,JERRY," That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.",65
29456,KRAMER, You know what I'm gonna do?  I'm gonna return this.,65
29457,JERRY, You're returning used fruit?,65
29458,KRAMER, Jerry this peach is sub par.,65
29459,KRAMER, I want restitution.,65
29460,KRAMER, Because it's no good.,65
29461,KRAMER," It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.",65
29462,KRAMER, So...,65
29463,KRAMER," You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.",65
29464,KRAMER, Oh now you don't want my business.,65
29465,KRAMER, But what am I gonna do for fruit?,65
29466,GEORGE,"  Heh.  You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto.  You have a very contented air over there.  You look very contented, very satisfied.  Are you satisfied?",65
29467,GEORGE, I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?,65
29468,GEORGE," Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...",65
29469,GEORGE, So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?,65
29470,GEORGE, Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?,65
29471,GEORGE, Yeah... full.,65
29472,ELAINE," Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo",65
29473,JERRY, Satisfied?,65
29474,ELAINE," Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?",65
29475,JERRY, Meryl Streep?,65
29476,ELAINE, You don't like her?,65
29477,JERRY," Ah, she's okay.",65
29478,ELAINE," I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.",65
29479,JERRY, Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?,65
29480,ELAINE," I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.",65
29481,JERRY," Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?",65
29482,ELAINE, What's the matter?,65
29483,JERRY, Nothing.,65
29484,ELAINE, You're not still thinking about that are you?,65
29485,JERRY, Nooo.,65
29486,ELAINE, Oh good.,65
29487,JERRY, Give me another shot!,65
29488,ELAINE,  What?,65
29489,JERRY," Another shot, I want another shot.",65
29490,ELAINE, You mean...?,65
29491,JERRY, Yes!,65
29492,ELAINE," Oooh no, I don't think so.",65
29493,JERRY," Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!",65
29494,ELAINE," Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.",65
29495,JERRY," Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship .",65
29496,ELAINE," Jerry no, that's important to me.",65
29497,JERRY, We won't ruin the friendship.,65
29498,ELAINE," Ya, Yes we will!",65
29499,JERRY, Elaine...,65
29500,ELAINE," No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.",65
29501,JERRY," A half hour, give me a half our.",65
29502,ELAINE, No!,65
29503,JERRY," Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!",65
29504,ELAINE, Noo!,65
29505,JERRY, You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?,65
29506,ELAINE," What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.",65
29507,JERRY," That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.",65
29508,ELAINE, That is so ridiculous.,65
29509,JERRY," Come on, Elaine!",65
29510,ELAINE, No.,65
29511,JERRY, Elaine?!,65
29512,ELAINE, No!,65
29513,GEORGE, It's Jerry's fault.,65
29514,GEORGE, Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.,65
29515,GEORGE, So you feel okay?,65
29516,JERRY, Well good night.,65
29517,ELAINE, I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.,65
29518,JERRY," Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.",65
29519,ELAINE, Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening .,65
29520,JERRY," Oh what, you're upset?",65
29521,ELAINE," Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?",65
29522,JERRY," No I can't, maybe you're faking.",65
29523,ELAINE," I'm really, really sorry I told you that.",65
29524,JERRY, I'm sorry too.,65
29525,ELAINE, Well stop being such a baby.,65
29526,JERRY, You're a baby!,65
29527,ELAINE, You're a baby!,65
29528,GEORGE," It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him",65
29529,JERRY, They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?,65
29530,GEORGE, I hate him!,65
29531,JERRY, You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.,65
29532,GEORGE, It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.,65
29533,KRAMER, Hey.,65
29534,JERRY, Hey.,65
29535,KRAMER," Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?",65
29536,JERRY, Why can't you get it?,65
29537,KRAMER, Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.,65
29538,JERRY, What happened?,65
29539,KRAMER," Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business.",65
29540,GEORGE," Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?",65
29541,JERRY,  No.  I told you not to say anything.,65
29542,KRAMER," Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?",65
29543,JERRY, Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.,65
29544,KRAMER," The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!",65
29545,JERRY, Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?,65
29546,GEORGE," Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?",65
29547,JERRY," Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question",65
29548,JERRY, Patty Lawrence had 'em!,65
29549,KRAMER," Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?",65
29550,JERRY, Yeah.,65
29551,JERRY, Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?,65
29552,JERRY, Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?,65
29553,KRAMER, All right now here's the list. ,65
29554,JERRY, All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?,65
29555,KRAMER, I like mangos.,65
29556,JERRY, Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.,65
29557,KRAMER, Well they gotta be soft.,65
29558,JERRY, How soft?,65
29559,KRAMER, Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.,65
29560,JERRY,"  Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?",65
29561,KRAMER, Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.,65
29562,JERRY, Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?,65
29563,KRAMER, Oh! And get some plantains. ,65
29564,JERRY, Plantains?,65
29565,KRAMER, Yeah.,65
29566,JERRY, What the hell is a plantain.,65
29567,KRAMER, It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.,65
29568,JERRY,  You're not getting any plantains.,65
29569,JERRY, Hey Joe.,65
29570,JERRY," Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.",65
29571,JERRY, What?,65
29572,JERRY,"  Wha, what are you talking about?",65
29573,JERRY, I can't buy mangos and plantains?,65
29574,JERRY," You're making a big mistake, Joe!",65
29575,JERRY, Are saying you're banning me from the store?,65
29576,JERRY, I'm banned?!,65
29577,GEORGE," All right, where do you want it?",65
29578,JERRY, Put it over there.,65
29579,KRAMER," Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful,  you did good George.",65
29580,GEORGE, All right I gotta get going.,65
29581,JERRY, What are you doing?,65
29582,GEORGE, I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.,65
29583,JERRY, You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.,65
29584,GEORGE, I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.,65
29585,KRAMER, This mango is delicious!,65
29586,GEORGE," That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.",65
29587,JERRY," Sorry, I don't have any cash.",65
29588,KRAMER, I only got hundreds.,65
29589,GEORGE, You see... All right I knew it.,65
29590,KRAMER," Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.",65
29591,GEORGE, I don't want any mango.,65
29592,KRAMER," Come on, take some. It's good.",65
29593,GEORGE, Very good. Juicy.,65
29594,KRAMER, Ya.,65
29595,GEORGE," Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.",65
29596,KRAMER, Mmm.,65
29597,JERRY, What?,65
29598,GEORGE, I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!,65
29599,KRAMER, Ya I told you.,65
29600,JERRY, What is it?,65
29601,GEORGE," I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.",65
29602,ELAINE, Hi George.,65
29603,GEORGE," I'm back, baby, I'm back!",65
29604,KRAMER, Want some mango?,65
29605,ELAINE," Noo, thanks.",65
29606,JERRY," Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre.  What brings you here?",65
29607,ELAINE, Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.,65
29608,JERRY, Oh and I've got some things of yours here.,65
29609,ELAINE, I know.,65
29610,JERRY, Well I'll get them.,65
29611,ELAINE, I'm waiting.,65
29612,JERRY, All right.  You got my fins?,65
29613,ELAINE, Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?,65
29614,JERRY, I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?,65
29615,ELAINE, They're next to the fins. You got my cards?,65
29616,JERRY, They're next to the poker chips.,65
29617,ELAINE, All right and that just about... does it.,65
29618,JERRY, I guess.,65
29619,ELAINE," Okay, welp... see you around.",65
29620,JERRY," Yeah, see you.",65
29621,ELAINE," All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.",65
29622,JERRY,  What?,65
29623,ELAINE, Come on!,65
29624,JERRY, Are you serious?,65
29625,ELAINE," Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.",65
29626,JERRY," Sex... to save the friendship.  Well, if we have to  we have to.",65
29627,GEORGE," Please, it's not necessary.",65
29628,GEORGE," The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?",65
29629,GEORGE, What am I talking about? Come on.  You don't think I bought all that? ,65
29630,GEORGE, You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.,65
29631,GEORGE, Come on,65
29632,GEORGE, What?,65
29633,GEORGE, But why?,65
29634,GEORGE, I-I-I can't find my glasses.,65
29635,GEORGE, I need to look for my glasses.,65
29636,JERRY, It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff,65
29637,ELAINE, You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?,65
29638,JERRY,"There's no way that moving in with your parents is a sign that your life is right on track. There's no way that you could fake this even, 'Ya things doing great, I've got a terrific girl, I got a great girl, making a lot of money, and if everything goes according to plan I'm gonna be moving back in with my parents soon.' It's like getting busted on a parole violation and getting thrown back into the slammer. 'In the opinion of the board you need further rehabilitation I'm afraid.' And y-you go back into that little room of yours. You feel so huge, it's like you could take your bed and crush it with your hands. You can hold your parents between your fingers  and going 'Why was I so afraid of you people when I was growing up?'",66
29639,GEORGE, I can't believe this.,66
29640,JERRY," Oh, it won't be for that long.",66
29641,GEORGE," How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that.",66
29642,JERRY," Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.",66
29643,GEORGE, How can you compare you parents to my parents?!,66
29644,JERRY, My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!,66
29645,GEORGE, My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!,66
29646,JERRY, My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.,66
29647,GEORGE,"  Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'",66
29648,JERRY, A smirk?,66
29649,GEORGE, Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!,66
29650,JERRY, I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.,66
29651,GEORGE," No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.",66
29652,KRAMER," Alright. I'm ready.  You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?",66
29653,GEORGE, I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.,66
29654,KRAMER," Well, move in here.",66
29655,JERRY,  What's that?,66
29656,KRAMER, Why doesn't he just move in here?,66
29657,GEORGE,"  Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!",66
29658,KRAMER," You can move in with me, if you want.",66
29659,GEORGE,"  Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.",66
29660,KRAMER," Hello, Mrs. Costanza.",66
29661,JERRY,"  Hello, Mrs. Costanza.",66
29662,KRAMER," Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. ",66
29663,KRAMER, Yeah. ,66
29664,GEORGE,  There's more.,66
29665,JERRY," Fine, Mrs. Costanza.  Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..",66
29666,JERRY," No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-",66
29667,GEORGE, Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!,66
29668,JERRY,  No thanks.,66
29669,KRAMER, Uhh.. no thanks. ,66
29670,JERRY, I really don't eat it.,66
29671,JERRY, I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..,66
29672,KRAMER,"  Alright, that's it. Anything else?",66
29673,GEORGE,"  No, that's it.",66
29674,KRAMER," Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright ",66
29675,JERRY," Well, I guess we'll be going.. ",66
29676,GEORGE,  What? You're going?,66
29677,JERRY, Yeah.,66
29678,GEORGE, Wha - what are you doing later?,66
29679,JERRY," Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.",66
29680,GEORGE, Really?,66
29681,JERRY," Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'",66
29682,GEORGE, Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?,66
29683,GEORGE,  Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.,66
29684,JERRY," Yeah, take it easy. ",66
29685,GEORGE," Oh, my God.. ",66
29686,ELAINE," Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! ",66
29687,JERRY, Right.,66
29688,ELAINE, You remember that?,66
29689,KRAMER," Yeah, well, that was a good one.",66
29690,JERRY, Well..,66
29691,ELAINE, What's that?,66
29692,JERRY, Excuse me?,66
29693,JERRY, Yeah.. yeah.,66
29694,ELAINE, Yep. Yeah..,66
29695,KRAMER," You know that, uh, Leslie  is in the clothing business? She's a designer.",66
29696,ELAINE,  Oh?,66
29697,KRAMER," In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt.  Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.",66
29698,ELAINE," Oh, a puffy shirt.",66
29699,JERRY, Puffy.,66
29700,KRAMER," Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..",66
29701,KRAMER,  That's true..  I'll be right back. ,66
29702,ELAINE," Uh, o...  Jerry's going to be on the ""Today"" show on Friday.",66
29703,JERRY," Yeah, that's right!",66
29704,ELAINE," Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a  benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the  poor, and the homeless..",66
29705,JERRY,  And the indigent.,66
29706,ELAINE," And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.",66
29707,JERRY, Sure.,66
29708,ELAINE," Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep.",66
29709,JERRY, Uh-huh.,66
29710,ELAINE, Yep.,66
29711,JERRY, Yep..,66
29712,ELAINE, Mmm,66
29713,GEORGE,  I'm not taking a civil service test.,66
29714,GEORGE," Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.",66
29715,ELAINE, Why don't you want to take a civil service test?,66
29716,GEORGE, To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?,66
29717,GEORGE, I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?,66
29718,GEORGE, I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!,66
29719,GEORGE,  Oh my God..,66
29720,GEORGE,  I need some air..,66
29721,GEORGE,  I got a lot of thinking to do.,66
29722,GEORGE," Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. ",66
29723,GEORGE,"  I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..",66
29724,GEORGE," It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..",66
29725,GEORGE, What?,66
29726,GEORGE, What about them?,66
29727,GEORGE, They are?,66
29728,GEORGE, Hand modeling? ,66
29729,JERRY,  I - I don't get it.,66
29730,GEORGE, Me neither!,66
29731,JERRY, What is it?,66
29732,GEORGE, I don't know.,66
29733,JERRY, They're hands!,66
29734,GEORGE, This woman just set me up for a job!,66
29735,JERRY,"  Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.",66
29736,GEORGE," What, are you kidding?  The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. ",66
29737,JERRY," Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.",66
29738,GEORGE," This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and  I bop into this woman..",66
29739,JERRY, It's just like in the movies.,66
29740,KRAMER, Hey. ,66
29741,JERRY, Hey.,66
29742,KRAMER," Hey, George! ",66
29743,GEORGE," OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!",66
29744,KRAMER, What?!,66

29746,KRAMER,"  But, it's only a toy!",66
29747,JERRY,  George has become a hand model.,66
29748,KRAMER, A hand model?,66
29749,JERRY, Yes.,66
29750,KRAMER,  Really? Let me see your hands.,66
29751,GEORGE,"  You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. ",66
29752,KRAMER," Let's see..  oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet  masculine.",66
29753,GEORGE,"  Alright,  I gotta get going.",66
29754,JERRY, Oven mitts?,66
29755,GEORGE,  That's all I could find.  Would you mind getting the door?,66
29756,KRAMER, Yeah..,66
29757,JERRY, Alright. ,66
29758,GEORGE, Thank you very much. ,66
29759,KRAMER," You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..",66
29760,JERRY, Uh-huh..  Since I said what?,66
29761,KRAMER, Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. ,66
29762,JERRY, What are you talking about?,66
29763,KRAMER, When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. ,66
29764,JERRY,  This?,66
29765,KRAMER, Yea.,66
29766,JERRY, I agreed to wear this?!,66
29767,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah.",66
29768,JERRY," But, when did I do that?",66
29769,KRAMER, When we went to dinner the other night.,66
29770,JERRY," What are you, crazy?!",66
29771,KRAMER, What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?,66
29772,JERRY, I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!,66
29773,KRAMER,  There you go.,66
29774,JERRY," Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!",66
29775,KRAMER," Yes, yes! You said it!",66
29776,JERRY," But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!",66
29777,KRAMER,"  Well, she asked you.",66
29778,JERRY," I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!",66
29779,KRAMER," Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em.",66
29780,JERRY, They're making these?,66
29781,KRAMER," Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!",66
29782,JERRY,"  But, I don't want to be a pirate!",66
29783,GEORGE,  Hand me an Emory board.,66
29784,GEORGE,  Scissor.  Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!,66
29785,GEORGE, You're sorry?!,66
29786,GEORGE,  I hope so. ,66
29787,GEORGE," Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.",66
29788,GEORGE,  I'll take it in my room. ,66
29789,KRAMER," Yeah, come in.",66
29790,KRAMER, Giddy-Up.  Jerry! Five minutes!,66
29791,KRAMER, Now that's a great looking shirt!  Aye Captain!  Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect.  Look at it! It's fantastic!,66
29792,JERRY,"  Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this!",66
29793,KRAMER,"  Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the  pirate look!",66
29794,KRAMER, Yeah.,66
29795,ELAINE," Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!",66
29796,KRAMER, Great.,66
29797,ELAINE,  What is that?!,66
29798,KRAMER," It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?",66
29799,ELAINE,  Why're you wearing that now?,66
29800,JERRY,"  'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!",66
29801,ELAINE," When did she,  when did she ask you this?",66
29802,JERRY," When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.",66
29803,ELAINE, I didn't hear anything.,66
29804,JERRY,  Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!,66
29805,ELAINE,"  Well, you can't wear that on the show.",66
29806,KRAMER,"  Elaine, you want to stop?",66
29807,ELAINE,"  Wha- What? No.  Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!",66
29808,JERRY,  I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!,66
29809,ELAINE,"  Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!",66
29810,GEORGE, Who was he?,66
29811,GEORGE,  What happened to him?,66
29812,GEORGE," You mean, uh..?",66
29813,GEORGE,  But how.. uh..?,66
29814,GEORGE,  You don't have to worry about me.  I won a contest.,66
29815,JERRY,"  Thank you, Bryant.",66

29819,JERRY," Uh-huh, yeah. ",66
29820,JERRY,"  Look, it's not my shirt.",66
29821,JERRY," What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. ",66
29822,JERRY,  THAT I heard.,66
29823,GEORGE, Like that?,66
29824,GEORGE, That's it?,66
29825,GEORGE,"  Oh, thank you very much. ",66
29826,JERRY," Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.",66
29827,JERRY,"  You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!",66
29828,GEORGE,"  Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check!  They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!",66
29829,ELAINE," Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.",66
29830,GEORGE, Alright. ,66
29831,ELAINE,"  Yeah, real nice.",66
29832,GEORGE,  Nice shirt..  What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?,66
29833,JERRY, Yeah.,66
29834,GEORGE," What, have you completely lost your mind?",66
29835,KRAMER,  Hey..,66
29836,GEORGE," Who's dressing you?  You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my-  AAHHHH!!!!! ",66

29838,GEORGE, Ow! Hot! Hot!,66
29839,ELAINE,  I'm sorry.,66
29840,GEORGE,  This McKigney guy had a few good years..  How could you forget to turn off an iron?,66
29841,KRAMER," Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.",66
29842,GEORGE," My whole life is ruined because of the  ""puffy shirt"".",66
29843,JERRY,  It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for,66
29844,ELAINE,"  Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.",66
29845,KRAMER, You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished.  We're  finished.,66
29846,JERRY, Really? What happened?,66
29847,KRAMER,  I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.,66
29848,JERRY, What happened with all the shirts?,66
29849,KRAMER, They gave them all to Goodwill.,66
29850,JERRY,"  You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..",66
29851,ELAINE, Do you ever spit on anybody from here?,67
29852,JERRY, No. You?,67
29853,ELAINE, No. Do you ever think about it?,67
29854,JERRY, Yeah.,67
29855,ELAINE, Me too.,67
29856,KRAMER, Hey.,67
29857,JERRY, Hey.,67
29858,KRAMER, Well I got it!,67
29859,JERRY, You got me the air conditioner?,67
29860,KRAMER, What do you think?,67
29861,JERRY, Beautiful!,67
29862,ELAINE, What air conditioner?,67
29863,KRAMER, Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.,67
29864,JERRY, Is it a good one?,67
29865,KRAMER, Good one? It's the Commando 8.,67
29866,JERRY, Commando 8?,67
29867,KRAMER," 12,000 BTU's.",67
29868,ELAINE, I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.,67
29869,KRAMER," Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning.",67
29870,ELAINE," Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy.  Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.",67
29871,JERRY, All right.,67
29872,KRAMER," Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?",67
29873,JERRY, Yeah.,67
29874,KRAMER," Yeah.  Yeah, rock on!",67
29875,GEORGE, I gotta get out of this city.,67
29876,JERRY, So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? ,67
29877,GEORGE," I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?",67
29878,ELAINE, You don't have an old pair?,67
29879,GEORGE, I broke 'em playing basketball.,67
29880,JERRY, He was running from a bee. ,67
29881,GEORGE, Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.,67
29882,ELAINE," George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?",67
29883,JERRY, There's a lot of change down there.,67
29884,GEORGE," When I find that guy, this much I vow",67
29885,JERRY," We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!",67
29886,GEORGE," What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?",67
29887,ELAINE," Yeah, especially those frames.",67
29888,KRAMER, You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.,67
29889,GEORGE," Yeah, come on.",67
29890,JERRY," Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.",67
29891,GEORGE, Really?,67
29892,KRAMER, Retail is for suckers.,67
29893,GEORGE," Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?",67
29894,KRAMER, You just gotta mention my name.,67
29895,GEORGE, That's it?,67
29896,KRAMER, That's it. ,67
29897,GEORGE, What about these?,67
29898,ELAINE, They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.,67
29899,GEORGE," Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.",67
29900,JERRY,"  Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.",67
29901,ELAINE," Now those look good, they're very bold.",67
29902,GEORGE," Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?",67
29903,JERRY,  I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.,67
29904,ELAINE," Hi there, little doggy.  Do you mind if I pet your dog?",67
29905,ELAINE, Hey little doggy.  Aaah!,67
29906,JERRY, Are you okay? Did he bite ya?,67
29907,GEORGE, Can you believe that guy?,67
29908,ELAINE," I'm okay, it's just a nip.",67
29909,GEORGE, He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time!  You! Dog man!,67
29910,ELAINE, My leg looks pretty bad.,67
29911,JERRY, Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.,67
29912,ELAINE, Okay.,67
29913,JERRY,"  Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?",67
29914,GEORGE," Uuh, no, no.",67
29915,JERRY," All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.",67
29916,GEORGE,"  Good, good, do that.",67
29917,JERRY, What's the matter?,67
29918,GEORGE," Oh, no, nothing.",67
29919,JERRY, What is it?,67
29920,GEORGE, I can't tell you.,67
29921,ELAINE,"  Jerry, can we go?",67
29922,JERRY," Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second.  What do you mean you can't tell me?",67
29923,GEORGE," I can't tell you, don't ask.",67
29924,JERRY, I'm asking!,67
29925,ELAINE," Jerry, my leg.",67
29926,JERRY," Yeah, yeah, take care of it.  Come on, George, what is it?",67
29927,GEORGE, I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.,67
29928,JERRY, What?,67
29929,GEORGE, They were right outside!,67
29930,JERRY, Amy and Jeffrey?,67
29931,GEORGE, Yes!,67
29932,JERRY, Are you sure?,67
29933,GEORGE," Yes, positive.",67
29934,JERRY," But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.",67
29935,GEORGE, I know! I was squinting.,67
29936,ELAINE," Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.",67
29937,JERRY, We're gonna have to talk about this later.  Thank you. Taxi!,67
29938,GEORGE,"  Excuse me, what do you think of these?",67
29939,GEORGE," Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.",67
29940,GEORGE, Yeah.  Kramer...,67
29941,GEORGE, Kramer...,67
29942,GEORGE, You do know Kramer?,67
29943,GEORGE," Well, I'm mentioning his name.",67
29944,GEORGE, Because... you know...,67
29945,ELAINE," Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!",67
29946,JERRY," Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.",67
29947,ELAINE," Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!",67
29948,JERRY, But he was squinting.,67
29949,ELAINE, So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.,67
29950,JERRY," Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!",67
29951,ELAINE, Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?,67
29952,ELAINE," No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?",67
29953,JERRY," Nah, look at this. Cable's out.",67
29954,JERRY," No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing.  I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?",67
29955,JERRY," Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.",67
29956,JERRY,  Oh you must have done something.,67
29957,JERRY, Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?,67
29958,JERRY," Well, your day's getting more interesting already.  Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.",67
29959,JERRY," No you can't.  Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?",67
29960,JERRY," Look, my friend saw you.",67
29961,JERRY, You tell me.,67
29962,JERRY, There isn't?,67
29963,JERRY, Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?,67
29964,JERRY, Why?,67
29965,JERRY," No, no, there's no side!",67
29966,JERRY," No, no, no ugly side.",67
29967,JERRY, Why?,67
29968,JERRY," Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?",67
29969,JERRY, It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.,67
29970,JERRY, I was an idiot for listening to you!,67
29971,GEORGE," Hey, I saw what I saw.",67
29972,JERRY," Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.",67
29973,GEORGE, What side?,67
29974,JERRY," A bad side, an ugly side.",67
29975,GEORGE," Ooh, so what?",67
29976,JERRY, So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.,67
29977,GEORGE, Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?,67
29978,JERRY," Ah, he'd just deny it.",67
29979,GEORGE, There must be some way to find out.,67
29980,JERRY, Amy said nothing happened.,67
29981,GEORGE," What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!",67
29982,JERRY," Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!",67
29983,GEORGE, I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough?  I was spotting those raccoons.,67
29984,JERRY," They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.",67
29985,GEORGE,"  Hey look, a dime.",67
29986,GEORGE," Heh, Mercury head. You mind?",67
29987,JERRY,"  No, keep it.  Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.",67
29988,ELAINE, There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.,67
29989,JERRY, A little white dog?,67
29990,ELAINE, Yeah.,67
29991,JERRY, Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?,67
29992,ELAINE, I'm afraid of dogs now.,67
29993,JERRY, He's like a squirrel.,67
29994,ELAINE, Well he frightened me.,67
29995,GEORGE, Did you get the shot?,67
29996,ELAINE, No. He said I didn't need a shot.,67
29997,GEORGE, You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?,67
29998,ELAINE," What, you think I should have?",67
29999,JERRY," You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.",67
30000,ELAINE," All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.",67
30001,KRAMER, The AC is on it's way.,67
30002,GEORGE," Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.",67
30003,KRAMER, What?,67
30004,GEORGE," That's right, no discount!",67
30005,KRAMER, Well did you mention my name?,67
30006,GEORGE," Yes, I mentioned your name.",67
30007,KRAMER, And?,67
30008,GEORGE," Pbbbs, Bubkis!",67
30009,KRAMER," Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.",67
30010,GEORGE," All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.",67
30011,JERRY," Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!",67
30012,KRAMER, Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!,67
30013,ELAINE," You know, George, that's an onion.",67
30014,GEORGE, Yes it is.,67
30015,ELAINE, He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?,67
30016,GEORGE," I saw them making out, you can believe it.",67
30017,JERRY," I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.",67
30018,KRAMER," Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.",67
30019,JERRY," Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.",67
30020,KRAMER," Right this way, mister Doody!",67
30021,GEORGE,  You'll see I'm right.,67
30022,KRAMER," Hey, Dwayny.",67
30023,KRAMER, What is going on here?,67
30024,KRAMER, I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.,67
30025,ELAINE, Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...,67
30026,GEORGE," Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.",67
30027,KRAMER," Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.",67
30028,KRAMER, Remember this?,67
30029,KRAMER, Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?,67
30030,KRAMER," Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!",67
30031,ELAINE, Can I just have the name...,67
30032,KRAMER, We'll see you Dwayne.,67
30033,JERRY," I don't know what to tell you, Elton.",67
30034,ELAINE,"  Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies",67
30035,JERRY,  Who picked these out?,67
30036,GEORGE, I did!,67
30037,JERRY, They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.,67
30038,GEORGE, Well Elaine was supposed to help me.,67
30039,ELAINE, Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!,67
30040,JERRY," Hey, hey.",67
30041,ELAINE, I'm sorry... sorry.,67
30042,KRAMER, Commando 8 has arrived!,67
30043,JERRY, Take it to the window.,67
30044,KRAMER, 12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power.  Installed!,67
30045,GEORGE, That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?,67
30046,KRAMER," No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest.  I'll seal that up later, right?",67
30047,JERRY, Just in time for Amy.,67
30048,GEORGE," Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?",67
30049,ELAINE," I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!",67
30050,KRAMER, Of what?,67
30051,JERRY, Rabies.,67
30052,KRAMER," Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!",67
30053,ELAINE," I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!",67
30054,JERRY," Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?",67
30055,ELAINE," I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.",67
30056,KRAMER," No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once.  May I have one of those, madam?",67
30057,GEORGE, Madam? What are you calling me madam for?,67
30058,KRAMER, They're ladies' glasses.,67
30059,KRAMER," Now look here, see it's right here",67
30060,GEORGE, He sold me ladies' glasses!,67
30061,ELAINE, I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.,67
30062,KRAMER," She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious.  She's foaming at the mouth!",67
30063,ELAINE, Is this gonna hurt?,67
30064,ELAINE, What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?,67
30065,JERRY," Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.",67
30066,ELAINE, Let me tell you this,67
30067,JERRY, He does look like a horse.,67
30068,ELAINE," Yeah, he's got a real horse face.  Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog!  Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!",67
30069,JERRY," Hey, shall we spit on him?",67
30070,ELAINE," No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.",67
30071,KRAMER,  Oh myyyy papayaaaa.  The air conditioner!  I think it got the dog!,67
30072,GEORGE," Ah, Oh boy.",67
30073,GEORGE," Oh uuh, sure, why not.  Hey, that's the guy.",67
30074,GEORGE, The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em!  Would you pick it up a little?,67
30075,GEORGE," He's getting on a bus, damn!  Those are nice glasses.",67
30076,GEORGE, Is that right?,67
30077,GEORGE," Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?",67
30078,GEORGE, And I'd like a discount.,67
30079,GEORGE," Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund.  You gave me ladies' frames!",67
30080,GEORGE," Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.",67
30081,GEORGE," No, that's Jerry.",67
30082,GEORGE," Yeah, 5A!",67
30083,JERRY," Oh, you'll find out.",67
30084,JERRY," Well, I'm very mysterious by nature.  A lot of women find that attractive.",67
30085,JERRY, Oh?,67
30086,JERRY, Uncle Leo?!,67
30087,JERRY, This is Amy.,67
30088,JERRY," Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?",67
30089,JERRY, Ooh! Very convenient.,67
30090,JERRY, Oh really?,67
30091,JERRY, Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?,67
30092,JERRY, Thank you.,67
30093,JERRY, To the Paul Simon concert in the park!,67
30094,JERRY," That's right, lady!",67
30095,JERRY, I thought you'd like that.,67
30096,JERRY," Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.",67
30097,JERRY, Thank you.,67
30098,JERRY,  Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!,67
30099,JERRY," Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.",67
30100,JERRY, Oh... oh... wanna get some pizza?,67
30101,GEORGE," Boy, these really do pinch the nose.",67
30102,GEORGE, Oh my God it is them.,67
30103,JERRY, I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.,67
30104,GEORGE," Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...",67
30105,JERRY,"To me government is basically parents or adults... especially the IRS, the IRS is like Ward and June Cleaver, and we're all Wally and the Beaver and your accountant is Eddy Hascal showing you all these neat tricks to get away with stuff. Which is fine unless you get audited then you don't want some wise guy in a suit just standing there going 'You have a very lovely office here sir.' Because jail is the government's way of sending you to your room and when you meet Whitey and Lumpy in the joint, there's really gonna be something wrong with the Beaver.",68
30106,JERRY," So, does he like you?",68
30107,ELAINE, What do you think?,68
30108,JERRY, You like him?,68
30109,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.",68
30110,GEORGE," So, what's wrong with him?",68
30111,ELAINE," Nothing, and I've looked.",68
30112,GEORGE," Well, I'm sure you'll find something.",68
30113,JERRY," So, how did you meet him?",68
30114,ELAINE, In the office.,68
30115,JERRY," So, he's a writer.",68
30116,ELAINE, Yeah.,68
30117,JERRY," Yeah, big surprise.",68
30118,ELAINE," So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.",68
30119,GEORGE, What are those?,68
30120,ELAINE," Ask your mother,  you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.",68
30121,JERRY," So, what did you do?",68
30122,ELAINE, I said,68
30123,GEORGE," Wow, just felt your material?",68
30124,ELAINE, Yeah...Jake Jarmel.,68
30125,GEORGE, Sounds like a cool guy.,68
30126,JERRY," Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.",68
30127,GEORGE," Jerry, where did you get that sweater?",68
30128,JERRY," Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.",68
30129,GEORGE, I think that's what the back of closets are for.,68
30130,ELAINE," Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. ",68
30131,JERRY,  Hey...,68
30132,ELAINE, Hi.,68
30133,GEORGE, Who's that?,68
30134,JERRY," That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant.",68
30135,GEORGE, I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.,68
30136,ELAINE," Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.",68
30137,JERRY," Hey Barry, how you doing?",68
30138,JERRY, This is my friend George.,68
30139,ELAINE," Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?",68
30140,JERRY," Yeah, so how's my money?",68
30141,JERRY," What, you got a cold?",68
30142,ELAINE," Wow, look at that ring.",68
30143,JERRY," Bathroom uh, bathroom's uh right over there.",68
30144,JERRY, Did you see that?,68
30145,ELAINE, See what?,68
30146,GEORGE," Yes, I saw that.",68
30147,ELAINE, What?,68
30148,JERRY, What was all that sniffing?,68
30149,ELAINE, I don't know.,68
30150,JERRY, You don't think...?,68
30151,ELAINE," Oh, no! Come on Jerry.",68
30152,GEORGE, He was definitely sniffing.,68
30153,JERRY," I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.",68
30154,ELAINE," No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.",68
30155,JERRY," Then, what was all that sniffing?",68
30156,ELAINE, Maybe it's the cold weather.,68
30157,JERRY, Today's not cold.,68
30158,GEORGE," All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.",68
30159,ELAINE,  Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.,68
30160,GEORGE, This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.,68
30161,GEORGE," Next Friday, what time?",68
30162,GEORGE, That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.,68
30163,GEORGE," I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?",68
30164,GEORGE, Do we have to...?,68
30165,GEORGE, They are made from lycra-spandex.,68
30166,GEORGE, She doesn't want to get a bra.,68
30167,GEORGE," All right, it wouldn't kill me.",68
30168,GEORGE, Yea I-I know about the cups.,68
30169,GEORGE, I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.,68
30170,GEORGE," I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. ",68
30171,KRAMER," Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing?",68
30172,JERRY," Sniffing, with his nose.",68
30173,KRAMER," Jerry, he probably had a cold.",68
30174,JERRY," No, I asked him.",68
30175,KRAMER," So, what are you saying?",68
30176,JERRY," I don't know, you know, what if...?",68
30177,KRAMER, Drugs? You think he's on drugs?,68
30178,JERRY, I don't know.,68
30179,KRAMER, Jerry,68
30180,JERRY, All I know he was sniffing.,68
30181,KRAMER," Listen, we went in on a CD together.",68
30182,JERRY, I know.,68
30183,KRAMER," And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.",68
30184,JERRY," Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.",68
30185,KRAMER," Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?",68
30186,JERRY," No, he didn't use 'man'.",68
30187,KRAMER," I mean when he was leaving did he say ""I'm splittin'""?",68
30188,JERRY," No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.",68
30189,KRAMER, Whoh!,68
30190,JERRY, Do you think that's a bad sign?,68
30191,KRAMER," Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?",68
30192,JERRY, I don't know.  This sweater really itches me. You want it?,68
30193,KRAMER,  Yeah.,68
30194,ELAINE," Hello.... hello, oh...",68
30195,ELAINE," You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.",68
30196,ELAINE, Did anyone call?,68
30197,ELAINE, Where are they?,68
30198,ELAINE," Thank you.  Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?",68
30199,ELAINE," She did? Oh, that's so great!",68
30200,ELAINE, In the drawer on the right. Hmm...,68
30201,ELAINE, Nah it's nothing.,68
30202,ELAINE, It's nothing.,68
30203,ELAINE," Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?",68
30204,ELAINE," See, right here you wrote ""Myra had the baby"", but you didn't use an exclamation point.",68
30205,ELAINE," So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.",68
30206,ELAINE," Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.",68
30207,ELAINE, You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.,68
30208,ELAINE, I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.,68
30209,ELAINE," Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!",68
30210,JERRY, You're out of your mind you know that.,68
30211,ELAINE, Why?,68
30212,JERRY, It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.,68
30213,ELAINE," Well, I felt a call for one.",68
30214,JERRY," A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.",68
30215,ELAINE, I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.,68
30216,JERRY, George was right. Didn't take you long.,68
30217,KRAMER, Anything new with that guy on drugs?,68
30218,ELAINE," Oh, he's not on drugs.",68
30219,KRAMER, Then why the sniffing? Who walks around  sniffing?,68
30220,ELAINE," All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.",68
30221,JERRY, Good idea. ,68
30222,JERRY," Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.",68
30223,JERRY, Out of town?,68
30224,JERRY, South America?,68
30225,KRAMER, South America?,68
30226,JERRY," I'll call back, thank you.  He went to South America!",68
30227,KRAMER, Yyyeeaaah!!,68
30228,ELAINE, So what?,68
30229,JERRY, Who goes to South America?,68
30230,ELAINE, People go to South America.,68
30231,JERRY," Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.",68
30232,ELAINE," So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?",68
30233,JERRY," Yes, I'm impugning a continent.",68
30234,KRAMER," Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!",68
30235,JERRY, Hello Newman.,68
30236,KRAMER," Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!",68
30237,ELAINE," Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.",68
30238,KRAMER," Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.",68
30239,ELAINE," Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on...",68
30240,JERRY, Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...,68
30241,KRAMER, What's today?,68
30242,KRAMER, Really? Feels like Tuesday.,68
30243,KRAMER, I feel Tuesday and Wednesday...,68
30244,JERRY," All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.",68
30245,KRAMER," Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives...",68
30246,JERRY, Yeah maybe you should.,68
30247,KRAMER, Maybe I will.,68
30248,JERRY," All right, what are you gonna say to him?",68
30249,KRAMER, Just gonna find out if he's interested.,68
30250,JERRY," No, you stay here in the car.",68
30251,JERRY," All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!",68
30252,JERRY, There he is. He's going into that bar.,68
30253,KRAMER," All right, I'm going in.",68
30254,JERRY, Be careful Kramer.,68
30255,JERRY," No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.",68
30256,JERRY, I might need you to get me a soda.,68
30257,KRAMER," I'll have a brewsky, Charlie.",68
30258,KRAMER," Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?",68
30259,KRAMER," Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things.  Cigarette?",68
30260,KRAMER," I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time.  Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella?",68
30261,KRAMER, Me neither.,68
30262,JERRY," You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.",68
30263,JERRY, You should try this.,68
30264,JERRY, Not even once?,68
30265,JERRY, You're an idiot.,68
30266,JERRY," Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.",68
30267,KRAMER, South America?,68
30268,KRAMER, Well that's a burgeoning continent.,68
30269,KRAMER, Tell me about it.,68
30270,KRAMER, I'm hip.,68
30271,KRAMER, To the whole scene. ,68
30272,KRAMER, The bathroom scene. ,68
30273,KRAMER, What ever turns you on.,68
30274,JERRY, What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?,68
30275,GEORGE," Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.",68
30276,GEORGE," No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled.",68
30277,GEORGE," Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew",68
30278,GEORGE," Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?",68
30279,GEORGE," Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir.",68
30280,GEORGE," If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.",68
30281,GEORGE," So long, Mr. Farkus.",68
30282,GEORGE," Oh, nothing...",68
30283,ELAINE," You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman?",68
30284,ELAINE, Yes  yes I did.,68
30285,ELAINE," Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.",68
30286,ELAINE," Right, well...",68
30287,ELAINE," That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...",68
30288,ELAINE," Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then  nothing comes out...",68
30289,ELAINE," Ok, ok ok ...",68
30290,ELAINE, ...ok I'll just....,68
30291,JERRY, 'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.',68
30292,KRAMER, Exclamation point.,68
30293,ELAINE, You still have no proof.,68
30294,KRAMER," Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.",68
30295,JERRY, 'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.,68
30296,KRAMER, Double exclamation point!,68
30297,JERRY," Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.",68
30298,JERRY," Yeah, thanks.",68
30299,JERRY, You know this...,68
30300,KRAMER," Hey, Ralph.",68
30301,JERRY, Hi Ralph.,68
30302,JERRY, All right.,68
30303,KRAMER," Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry?",68
30304,JERRY, Yeah.,68
30305,KRAMER, What's the matter? You've got a cold?,68
30306,KRAMER, It's a sweater.,68
30307,KRAMER," I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.",68
30308,JERRY," Mohair, I think.",68
30309,JERRY, You mean you just started sniffing?,68
30310,JERRY, I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.,68
30311,KRAMER," Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.",68
30312,ELAINE," The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.",68
30313,JERRY," Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!",68
30314,KRAMER, Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.,68
30315,JERRY, The what??,68
30316,GEORGE," So what, what is so bad about that?",68
30317,ELAINE, You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.,68
30318,JERRY," Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.",68
30319,ELAINE, What is this?,68
30320,JERRY, It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.,68
30321,ELAINE," He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?",68
30322,JERRY," Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!",68
30323,ELAINE," What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.",68
30324,KRAMER," All right, What about the money?",68
30325,JERRY," What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!",68
30326,JERRY, Think so?,68
30327,JERRY," Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?",68
30328,JERRY,"Really at the Hospital, the basic treatment everybody gets, is to lie in a bed. What is wrong with the human being, lie down. Doctor never says to you 'Well your condition isn't as bad as we originally thought we want you to kinda  lean against a door jam for seven to ten days. See how that feels'  Alright it's always a bed, unless you goto the emergency room then it's a chair. You were shot, you were stabbed, you were run over. Have a seat. There's always a very uh interesting cultural ethnic mix to the hospital staff isn't it? It's like a local news team in there. The doctor is like the anchor man he's got the white hair, he's in charge, the nurse is like the feature reporter you know. You listen to her but it's always 'And now back to your doctor.' And the orderlies come in with the food and the bed pans and that's like your sports and weather.",69
30329,ELAINE, Whoa.,69
30330,JERRY,"  Thanks, that's enough.",69
30331,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah, yeah.",69
30332,JERRY," Yeah, I looked. I saw.",69
30333,JERRY," No, Uncomfortable? Not at all.  My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?",69
30334,JERRY, So how long do they do this?,69
30335,JERRY, No break?,69
30336,JERRY," So after the sucking, comes the weaning.",69
30337,ELAINE, First the sucking then the weaning.,69
30338,JERRY," Well, you gotta wean.",69
30339,ELAINE, Must wean.,69
30340,GEORGE, What about that spot I got?,69
30341,JERRY," Yeah, I saw the spot.",69
30342,GEORGE," You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot.  I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.",69
30343,JERRY, George...,69
30344,GEORGE," Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself.",69
30345,JERRY,  Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.,69
30346,ELAINE, Did you give him the room number?,69
30347,JERRY," Ya, 1397.",69
30348,KRAMER," 1937, 1937, 1937...",69
30349,KRAMER," Uh ya, it's right around the corner there.",69
30350,KRAMER, 1937.,69
30351,KRAMER," Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man!",69
30352,GEORGE, You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.,69
30353,JERRY, Will you shut up George.,69
30354,ELAINE, I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.,69
30355,JERRY, You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that.,69
30356,ELAINE," Huuh, Wow.",69
30357,JERRY, Me? Godfather?,69
30358,JERRY,"  Never go against the family, Elaine.",69
30359,ELAINE, What?,69
30360,KRAMER," Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this .",69
30361,GEORGE," Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?",69
30362,KRAMER, I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.,69
30363,GEORGE, A pig-man?,69
30364,KRAMER," A pig-man. Half pig, half man!",69
30365,ELAINE," That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.",69
30366,JERRY,"  Elaine, never ask me about my business!....  ""Godfather.""",69
30367,JERRY, The bris?,69
30368,KRAMER, A bris? You mean circumcision?,69
30369,KRAMER, I would advise against that.,69
30370,ELAINE," Wha, Kramer. It's a tradition.",69
30371,KRAMER," Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.",69
30372,JERRY," Well, maybe we should.",69
30373,GEORGE,"  Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?",69
30374,KRAMER, I don't know.,69
30375,JERRY, Maybe they're admiring your spot.,69
30376,KRAMER, They're all looking up.,69
30377,GEORGE," Hey, there's a guy up the roof.",69
30378,KRAMER, Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was.,69
30379,GEORGE," Oh well, I hope he doesn't jum...",69
30380,GEORGE, My car! My caaaaarrrr!,69
30381,ELAINE, A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?,69
30382,JERRY, A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.,69
30383,ELAINE," Where am I going to find a Mohel?  Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?",69
30384,JERRY," Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?",69
30385,ELAINE," Hey Jerry, you ever seen one?",69
30386,JERRY, You mean that wasn't uh.,69
30387,ELAINE, Yeah.,69
30388,JERRY, No.. you?,69
30389,ELAINE, Ya.,69
30390,JERRY, What'd you think?,69
30391,ELAINE,"  No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.",69
30392,JERRY, Hey.,69
30393,GEORGE," Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.",69
30394,JERRY," Ah, you're screwed.",69
30395,GEORGE," I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.",69
30396,ELAINE, Well I have to interview a Mohel.,69
30397,JERRY, How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.,69
30398,KRAMER, YEA!,69
30399,JERRY, What's the matter?,69
30400,ELAINE, Are you alright?,69
30401,KRAMER," Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed.  Look at that.",69
30402,JERRY, What now?,69
30403,KRAMER, Look look.,69
30404,JERRY,"  ""Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research"".."" Government funds genetic research at area hospital"" ... Yeah, so?",69
30405,KRAMER," pig-man, baby. pig-man.",69
30406,ELAINE, If I hear about this pig-man one more time...,69
30407,KRAMER," Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties.",69
30408,JERRY," Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!",69
30409,KRAMER, Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.,69
30410,GEORGE," I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, ""Hey he's no pig-man!""",69
30411,JERRY," Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. ""Oo that little tail really turns me on.""",69
30412,ELAINE,  That's just about enough,69
30413,JERRY," Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?",69
30414,ELAINE," Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.",69
30415,KRAMER," You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.",69
30416,ELAINE," Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.",69
30417,GEORGE," But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?",69
30418,KRAMER," It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.",69
30419,GEORGE, Yeah. So how does that help me?,69
30420,JERRY,"  Hey George, you ever see one?",69
30421,GEORGE," Yeah, my roommate in college.",69
30422,JERRY, So what'd you think?,69
30423,GEORGE,  I got used to it.,69
30424,JERRY," Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.",69
30425,KRAMER," Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same.",69
30426,JERRY," Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this.  You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.",69
30427,KRAMER," Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished ""oink"" of pig-man cries out for help.",69
30428,JERRY," Well, if I hear an anguished ""oink"", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look  Human, human, human...   Wait a second! ",69
30429,KRAMER, What?!,69
30430,JERRY," Oh, it's George.",69
30431,GEORGE, Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.,69
30432,KRAMER, Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?,69
30433,GEORGE, The pig-man can take the bus.,69
30434,KRAMER," George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.",69
30435,GEORGE, How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?,69
30436,KRAMER, Be realistic George.,69
30437,GEORGE," I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.",69
30438,KRAMER, Yea.,69
30439,GEORGE," Well, I join them in their grief.",69
30440,GEORGE," That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?",69
30441,GEORGE," Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.",69
30442,GEORGE," Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.",69
30443,GEORGE," Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.",69
30444,GEORGE," Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.",69
30445,GEORGE, Yes.,69
30446,GEORGE, Yes.,69
30447,GEORGE,"  Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..",69
30448,GEORGE, Should I leave this..?,69
30449,KRAMER," Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?",69
30450,KRAMER, You know. .,69
30451,KRAMER,  This doesn't look familiar to you?,69
30452,KRAMER," Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink.",69
30453,KRAMER,"  Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!",69
30454,KRAMER," You know what I mean - pork, sausage,  A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.",69
30455,KRAMER, He's lying.,69
30456,JERRY," Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.",69
30457,KRAMER, Alright you go ahead.,69
30458,JERRY, Kramer.,69
30459,JERRY, Where's the Mohel?,69
30460,ELAINE, He'll be here.,69
30461,JERRY, He's late already.,69
30462,ELAINE, Relax. You'd think you were getting whacked.,69
30463,JERRY," I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?",69
30464,ELAINE, I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.,69
30465,JERRY, Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.,69
30466,ELAINE, What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.,69
30467,JERRY, Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.,69
30468,ELAINE, Yes it is level jumping.,69
30469,GEORGE, So uh... been to a bris before?,69
30470,GEORGE," I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. ",69
30471,GEORGE, Oh.,69
30472,KRAMER," We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger  cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch.",69
30473,ELAINE," Kramer, what's the matter with you?",69
30474,KRAMER, Me?,69
30475,ELAINE,"  Oh, that's the Mohel.",69
30476,ELAINE, Hello.,69
30477,JERRY, Hello.,69
30478,ELAINE, Did you find the place alright?,69
30479,ELAINE,"  Oh, ya haha.",69
30480,ELAINE,  He's very highly recommended. So...,69
30481,GEORGE,"  No, No.",69
30482,JERRY,  Yeah. I'm holding the baby.,69
30483,ELAINE,"  Ok, go.",69
30484,JERRY, I'm going.,69
30485,ELAINE, Go.,69
30486,JERRY, I'm going.,69
30487,ELAINE, C'mon,69
30488,JERRY, Don't push me.,69
30489,KRAMER," No, I'm not going to let this happen.",69
30490,ELAINE, Ok.,69
30491,JERRY, Hurry up George! Step on it!,69
30492,GEORGE," Alright, alright!",69
30493,JERRY, That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!,69
30494,ELAINE, You flinched.,69
30495,JERRY," Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?",69
30496,ELAINE, Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.,69
30497,GEORGE," It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.",69
30498,JERRY, Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!,69
30499,GEORGE," Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car.",69
30500,KRAMER, What about the baby?,69
30501,JERRY, Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.,69
30502,ELAINE, Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches.,69
30503,JERRY, A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!,69
30504,GEORGE," Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me.",69
30505,GEORGE, I have never seen a Mohel like that.,69
30506,JERRY, That was a one in a million Mohel.,69
30507,ELAINE, I said I'm sorry.,69
30508,JERRY, Look at this.,69
30509,KRAMER, Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later.,69
30510,GEORGE," Wha, where is he going?",69
30511,JERRY, Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.,69
30512,JERRY," Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?",69
30513,JERRY," Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!",69
30514,JERRY," Oh don't threaten me, Butcher Boy.",69
30515,JERRY, Ya what was this? ,69
30516,JERRY, It was not!,69
30517,ELAINE," Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!",69
30518,ELAINE," Oh, how's the baby?",69
30519,KRAMER,  Outta My Way!,69
30520,JERRY,"  I can't do it.  Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.",69
30521,ELAINE, You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.,69
30522,JERRY,"  Oh, that's the Flicks.",69
30523,GEORGE,"  It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion..  looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you.  So any word from the ""pig-man""?",69
30524,KRAMER, No.,69
30525,GEORGE, No. And he's not a pig-man is he?,69
30526,KRAMER," NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient.",69
30527,JERRY," Myra, Stan.",69
30528,JERRY, What's the matter?,69
30529,ELAINE, But I didn't do anything.,69
30530,KRAMER,  Don't ever go against the family Jerry.,69
30531,KRAMER, Yes,69
30532,JERRY," Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. ""That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."" ",70
30533,JERRY, Are these seats unbelievable or what? ,70
30534,GEORGE, Where's the sunblock? ,70
30535,JERRY, Here. ,70
30536,GEORGE, 25? You don't have anything higher? ,70
30537,JERRY," What, are you on Mercury? ",70
30538,GEORGE," I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free. ",70
30539,JERRY, You got a problem with paba? ,70
30540,GEORGE," Yes, I have a problem with paba. ",70
30541,JERRY, You don't even know what paba is. ,70
30542,GEORGE, I know enough to stay away from it. ,70
30543,GEORGE, So are you going to Todd's party this weekend? ,70
30544,JERRY, I'll go if someone else drives. You going? ,70
30545,GEORGE, Gwen really wants to go. ,70
30546,JERRY, You're bringing a date to a party? ,70
30547,GEORGE, No good? ,70
30548,JERRY," A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate.  Ho, ho, ho. ",70
30549,GEORGE, Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to? ,70
30550,JERRY," Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy. ",70
30551,GEORGE," Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated. ",70
30552,JERRY, That woman is absolutely stunning. ,70
30553,GEORGE," Who, the Croat? [the tennis player] ",70
30554,JERRY," Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen. ",70
30555,GEORGE," Yeah, she's a B.L. ",70
30556,JERRY, B.L.? ,70
30557,GEORGE, Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry?  Jerry? ,70
30558,ELAINE,"  Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting? ",70
30559,ELAINE," Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage. ",70
30560,ELAINE," Yea, I guess that could work. ",70
30561,KRAMER," Hey, hey, it's George. ",70
30562,ELAINE, Pardon me? ,70
30563,ELAINE, Yeah. ,70
30564,ELAINE," You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So... ",70
30565,ELAINE, I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf. ,70
30566,ELAINE, What? ,70
30567,ELAINE, It can be very frustrating. ,70
30568,ELAINE," Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life. ",70
30569,JERRY, I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing. ,70
30570,GEORGE, Boy you are really smitten. ,70
30571,JERRY, I gotta talk to her. What do you think? ,70
30572,GEORGE, Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys. ,70
30573,JERRY, I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals. ,70
30574,GEORGE, They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side. ,70
30575,JERRY, I have to. I won't be able to live with myself. ,70
30576,GEORGE," Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you. ",70
30577,JERRY, I can't. ,70
30578,GEORGE, What are you going to say? ,70
30579,JERRY," I don't know, ""Hi"". ",70
30580,GEORGE,"  You think you're going to the other side with ""Hi""? You're not going to make it. ",70
30581,ELAINE, Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him. ,70
30582,ELAINE,  Yeah. Yes it does... ,70
30583,ELAINE," No no, no no. ",70
30584,JERRY," Excuse me.  Excuse me?  Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you  oh well, what are you deaf? ",70
30585,KRAMER, And you're saying she's deaf. ,70
30586,JERRY," I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf. ",70
30587,KRAMER, Can't hear a thing. ,70
30588,JERRY, Can't hear a thing. ,70
30589,KRAMER, And you're going to go out with her. ,70
30590,JERRY," Yeah, isn't that something? ",70
30591,ELAINE, Hey. ,70
30592,KRAMER, Hey I know how to sign. ,70
30593,JERRY, Really? ,70
30594,KRAMER," Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year.  So I haven't been able to do it in a while. ",70
30595,ELAINE, What is this about? ,70
30596,JERRY, I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match. ,70
30597,ELAINE," You are kidding. That is amazing.  I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf. ",70
30598,JERRY, Wow good plan. ,70
30599,ELAINE," Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person. ",70
30600,ELAINE," No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say ""get out of here"". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people. ",70
30601,JERRY, That's nice. ,70
30602,ELAINE," Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable. ",70
30603,JERRY,  That's nice for the freaks. ,70
30604,ELAINE," Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do? ",70
30605,JERRY," Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency. ",70
30606,KRAMER," Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something. ",70
30607,ELAINE, Really?,70
30608,KRAMER, Like a rock concert. Whatever you like. ,70
30609,ELAINE," Oh great, thanks Kramer. ",70
30610,KRAMER," You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that. ",70
30611,JERRY," Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men. ",70
30612,ELAINE, Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man. ,70
30613,KRAMER, Well there ought to be ball men. ,70
30614,JERRY," All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier.  Hey.",70
30615,ELAINE, Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday. ,70
30616,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's...  ",70
30617,GEORGE, I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened. ,70
30618,GEORGE," You're giving me the ""it's not you, it's me"" routine? I invented ""it's not you, it's me"". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me. ",70
30619,GEORGE, You're *damn* right it's me. ,70
30620,GEORGE, I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me. ,70
30621,GEORGE, Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out. ,70
30622,JERRY, But I thought things were going great. ,70
30623,GEORGE, Yeah so did I. ,70
30624,JERRY, Did she say why? ,70
30625,GEORGE," No. She tried to give me the ""it's not you, it's me"" routine. ",70
30626,JERRY, But that's your routine. ,70
30627,GEORGE, Yeah. Well aparently word's out. ,70
30628,KRAMER," Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday. ",70
30629,GEORGE, Really? At the tennis match? ,70
30630,KRAMER, Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. ,70
30631,GEORGE, Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there. ,70
30632,KRAMER," Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you. ",70
30633,GEORGE, Cracks? What were they saying? ,70
30634,KRAMER, That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked. ,70
30635,GEORGE," Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it. ",70
30636,KRAMER, Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight. ,70
30637,GEORGE, She must have seen me eating it on TV. ,70
30638,JERRY, So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial? ,70
30639,GEORGE, Why not. I would be. ,70
30640,JERRY," Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye. ",70
30641,GEORGE, You're parents saw me on TV? ,70
30642,JERRY, Yeah. ,70
30643,GEORGE, This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on? ,70
30644,KRAMER, It felt like 8 seconds. ,70
30645,GEORGE," One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand. ",70
30646,ELAINE, I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it? ,70
30647,GEORGE, Can we move on? ,70
30648,JERRY, He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV. ,70
30649,ELAINE, Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her. ,70
30650,GEORGE, Yes I do. ,70
30651,ELAINE, So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday. ,70
30652,GEORGE," Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there. ",70
30653,KRAMER, Well she should be the one that shouldn't go. ,70
30654,JERRY," Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette? ",70
30655,KRAMER, Excellent question. ,70
30656,JERRY," I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life. ",70
30657,ELAINE, I beg to differ. ,70
30658,JERRY, Really. ,70
30659,ELAINE, He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils. ,70
30660,JERRY," Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night. ",70
30661,ELAINE, Well we can take the car service from my office. ,70
30662,JERRY, Really? ,70
30663,ELAINE," Yeah, they don't know. ",70
30664,KRAMER," All right, I'll see you later. ",70
30665,JERRY, Okay. ,70
30666,KRAMER,  Hey Georgie.,70
30667,GEORGE," ""To the victor goes the spoils."" What are you going to do tonight? ",70
30668,JERRY, Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman. ,70
30669,GEORGE, Oh.  ,70
30670,JERRY, Why?  Well what are you doing? ,70
30671,GEORGE, Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything. ,70
30672,JERRY," Oh, uh, do you want to come with us? ",70
30673,GEORGE," Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh,  where would we be going? ",70
30674,GEORGE," So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship. ",70
30675,JERRY, Let's get the check.  Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check? ,70
30676,JERRY," Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign. ",70
30677,GEORGE, They're breaking up? How do you know? ,70
30678,JERRY, She reads lips. ,70
30679,GEORGE, What are they saying now? ,70
30680,GEORGE,"  Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me. ",70
30681,JERRY,  What? ,70
30682,GEORGE,"  We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me. ",70
30683,JERRY,"  She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas. ",70
30684,GEORGE,"  Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off. ",70
30685,JERRY,  I don't know George. I'm not sure about this. ,70
30686,GEORGE,"  Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed. ",70
30687,JERRY,  All right. ,70
30688,JERRY," Uh Laura, George was wondering if... ",70
30689,JERRY, So I really had a good time. ,70
30690,JERRY, So you want to go to the party on Friday night? ,70
30691,JERRY," All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? . Six is good. . You got a problem with six? . What? What? ",70
30692,KRAMER," I may be old, but I'm spry. ",70
30693,KRAMER, Oh I'll be up for it punk. ,70
30694,JERRY," See I was saying ""six"" but she thought I was saying ""sex"". We straightened the whole thing out though. ",70
30695,GEORGE," She confused ""six"" with ""sex""? ",70
30696,JERRY, Yeah. ,70
30697,GEORGE," Well if she can't tell ""six"" from ""sex"" then how is she going to lip read from across the room? ",70
30698,JERRY," Well ""six"" and ""sex"" are close. ",70
30699,GEORGE," It's two completely different sounds. ""ih"" and ""eh"". ",70
30700,JERRY, Eh. ,70
30701,GEORGE, It seems like a problem. ,70
30702,JERRY, Well I'm not dating any other deaf women. ,70
30703,KRAMER, Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals. ,70
30704,JERRY, You're kidding. ,70
30705,KRAMER, Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto. ,70
30706,GEORGE," Oh, when is that car service coming? ",70
30707,JERRY," In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there. ",70
30708,GEORGE, If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend. ,70
30709,JERRY, I know. It's like X-ray vision. ,70
30710,GEORGE," If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us. ",70
30711,JERRY, Can't do it Newman. ,70
30712,JERRY, It's not going to happen. ,70
30713,JERRY, Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign. ,70
30714,JERRY, I said pull over by the stop sign. ,70
30715,KRAMER, -ca. ,70
30716,GEORGE, What? ,70
30717,JERRY, ca. ,70
30718,GEORGE, ah. ,70
30719,JERRY, You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night. ,70
30720,JERRY," I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs,  check, and  late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man. ",70
30721,KRAMER, She doesn't know what she's talking about. ,70
30722,GEORGE, Hey hey.,70
30723,JERRY, Hey Todd.,70
30724,GEORGE, Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me? ,70
30725,GEORGE, Really?,70
30726,GEORGE," I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything. ",70
30727,GEORGE," Hey, grown-up.  Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead.  Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying? ",70
30728,KRAMER," ""Hi Gwen, hi tide."" ",70
30729,JERRY, Hi tide? ,70
30730,KRAMER, Hi Todd. ,70
30731,KRAMER," ""You've got something between your teeth"" ",70
30732,GEORGE, Wheret? ,70
30733,KRAMER," No that's what he said. ""That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup."" So do I. ",70
30734,ELAINE, She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon? ,70
30735,JERRY, No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody. ,70
30736,KRAMER," ""Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."" ",70
30737,GEORGE, What? ,70
30738,KRAMER," ""You want me to sleep with you?"" ",70
30739,KRAMER," He says ""I don't want to sleep alone."" She says, oh boy, ""love to."" ",70
30740,GEORGE, Alright that's it.  So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together? ,70
30741,KRAMER," ""What? You're crazy."" ",70
30742,GEORGE, I heard your whole conversation. ,70
30743,KRAMER," ""How?"" ",70
30744,GEORGE,  I can read lips. You said let's sleep together. ,70
30745,KRAMER," ""... with a broom, cleaning up."" ",70
30746,GEORGE, Sweep? ,70
30747,KRAMER," ""Yes sweep."" ",70
30748,GEORGE, Cut it. ,70
30749,KRAMER," George says ""Cut it."" ",70
30750,GEORGE, Cut it. ,70
30751,KRAMER," George is saying ""Cut it."" ",70
30752,GEORGE, Cut it.   Would you stop signing? ,70
30753,KRAMER, What?,70
30754,GEORGE," She said ""sweep together"" you idiots, not ""sleep together."" ",70
30755,KRAMER, I know how to sign. ,70
30756,GEORGE," Ow. My eye, my eye. ",70
30757,ELAINE, It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals. ,70
30758,JERRY, I know and on the first tournament of her comeback. ,70
30759,JERRY, Thus ends the great ball man experiment. ,70
30760,JERRY," I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know  Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, ""Do you want the check?"" No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people. ",70
30761,JERRY,"I had glasses when I was ten years old and anybody beat that? Did anyone get them younger than that?  Seven? Two? Anybody born with glasses? Actually come out of the birth canal and go  'that was a hell of a delivery, I'll tell ya that.  Can I clean these?  Does anybody have one of those little clothes? I jus...I was just born they...they're a little smudgy.",71
30762,ELAINE, Hmm!,71
30763,GEORGE, Fantastic!,71
30764,JERRY, I told ya. How good is this?,71
30765,GEORGE, Good.,71
30766,JERRY, How good?,71
30767,GEORGE, Very good.,71
30768,JERRY, I know it.,71
30769,ELAINE, They put real blue berries in this. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get?,71
30770,JERRY," Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in.",71
30771,ELAINE, Let me test-taste that. ,71
30772,JERRY, Huh? Huh?,71
30773,ELAINE, Hmm! Rico!,71
30774,JERRY, Suave! And it's non-fat!,71
30775,GEORGE," Ya-see, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.",71
30776,ELAINE,  You want to taste mine?,71
30777,GEORGE,"  Oh, you want to taste mine.",71
30778,ELAINE," No, I don't.",71
30779,GEORGE," Lo..k, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours.",71
30780,ELAINE," All right, let's just forget it.",71
30781,JERRY," You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.",71
30782,GEORGE, What do you mean?,71
30783,JERRY, He invested in it.,71
30784,GEORGE, No kidding?,71
30785,JERRY, Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fucking good.,71
30786,JERRY," Oh, I'm sorry.",71
30787,ELAINE," All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?",71
30788,GEORGE," Oh, god. Look who's here.",71
30789,JERRY, Who is it?,71
30790,GEORGE, This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.,71
30791,JERRY," Oh, oh.?",71
30792,GEORGE, Hey-hay! Lloyd! Hey! My friend Jerry eh.,71
30793,JERRY, Hi.,71
30794,GEORGE," Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.",71
30795,GEORGE," Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I-I bumped my elbow on a desk and uh injured something an.. now it sort of moves involuntarily.",71
30796,GEORGE," Oh, pretty good.",71
30797,GEORGE," Yeah, this is my first time here. ",71
30798,ELAINE, Hi!,71
30799,GEORGE," Uh, Elaine, this is, uh, Lloyd.",71
30800,ELAINE, Hi!,71
30801,ELAINE," Nice to meet you, too!",71
30802,GEORGE, Yeah! Yeah.,71
30803,ELAINE,"  Aaah. Boy, he is really cute!",71
30804,GEORGE, He's a jerk. ,71
30805,JERRY," He's gone, George.",71
30806,GEORGE, All right. All right.,71
30807,KRAMER," So, there were a lot of people there, huh?",71
30808,JERRY," Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.",71
30809,KRAMER, Yeah.,71
30810,JERRY, They're doing an incredible business.,71
30811,KRAMER," Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.",71
30812,JERRY, How did you know?,71
30813,KRAMER," Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.",71
30814,JERRY,  Yeah?,71
30815,ELAINE,  Buzz me.,71
30816,JERRY," Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.",71
30817,KRAMER," Yeah, but did you tape it?",71
30818,JERRY,"  Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?",71
30819,KRAMER, Yes!,71
30820,JERRY," I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.",71
30821,ELAINE, Hey!,71
30822,KRAMER, Hey!,71
30823,JERRY, What's the matter?,71
30824,ELAINE," Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.",71
30825,JERRY," Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.",71
30826,KRAMER,  Yowm!,71
30827,ELAINE, What?,71
30828,KRAMER," Well, you're getting heavy.",71
30829,ELAINE,  What?,71
30830,KRAMER," Yeah, you look like you put on  five,  ten pounds.",71
30831,JERRY, Kramer!,71
30832,KRAMER," I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.",71
30833,JERRY, Me?,71
30834,KRAMER, Yeah.,71
30835,JERRY, No.,71
30836,ELAINE," Where's your bathroom scale?  Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.",71
30837,JERRY, I've gained eight.,71
30838,KRAMER, I told ya.,71
30839,ELAINE," Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?",71
30840,JERRY, How did I gain eight?,71
30841,ELAINE," I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.",71
30842,JERRY," Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.",71
30843,KRAMER," No, no, no. That's hundred percent non-fat.",71
30844,JERRY," Well, how else could this have happened?",71
30845,KRAMER," Well, maybe it's the Oreos.",71
30846,ELAINE, I don't eat Oreos.,71
30847,KRAMER, You don't eat Oreos?  The way you break them open? You're  ~ practically having sex with them.,71
30848,JERRY, What about me?,71
30849,KRAMER, You? You're getting old.,71
30850,JERRY, Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.,71
30851,KRAMER," Oh, guess again, Tubby!",71
30852,ELAINE," Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.",71
30853,JERRY, There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.,71
30854,ELAINE, AH! I've got it.,71
30855,KRAMER, What?,71
30856,ELAINE, I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.,71
30857,KRAMER," Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubs, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week.",71
30858,JERRY," Well, let's start the insanity.",71
30859,KRAMER, NNNN-Giddy-up!,71
30860,GEORGE, No.,71
30861,GEORGE, What's for supper?,71
30862,GEORGE," Hey, Lloyd.  How's it going? ",71
30863,GEORGE," Oh, it's good.",71
30864,GEORGE, Nothing.,71
30865,GEORGE, Yeah.,71
30866,GEORGE," Well, it comes and goes.",71
30867,GEORGE," You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor  there's really nothing they can do.",71
30868,GEORGE, All right. All right! I'll go.,71
30869,ELAINE," Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right.  Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.",71
30870,JERRY, And they said they can do it?,71
30871,ELAINE," Yeah, it's forty-five bucks.",71
30872,JERRY," All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.",71
30873,ELAINE, Hm-hmm.,71
30874,JERRY, What?,71
30875,JERRY," Gee, I'm really sorry.",71
30876,JERRY, I'd be happy to.,71
30877,JERRY," Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?",71
30878,GEORGE," Oh, uh, just a friend of mine.",71
30879,GEORGE," Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.",71
30880,GEORGE, Yeah!,71
30881,JERRY," Hello, Newman.",71
30882,JERRY, It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.,71
30883,ELAINE," I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?",71
30884,ELAINE," 'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.",71
30885,ELAINE," Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!",71
30886,JERRY, How's it doing?,71
30887,ELAINE, Not so good.,71
30888,KRAMER," Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.",71
30889,JERRY, So what.,71
30890,KRAMER, It changes the molecules.,71
30891,JERRY," Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.",71
30892,KRAMER," Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.",71
30893,JERRY, You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.,71
30894,ELAINE," Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.",71
30895,ELAINE," Uh, does it matter if it's melted?",71
30896,ELAINE, That's okay.,71
30897,KRAMER," Hello, there.",71
30898,KRAMER, Ooh! Test tubes. Cool!,71
30899,JERRY, What do you got there?,71
30900,JERRY, Oh.,71
30901,ELAINE," Okay, I'm done.",71
30902,KRAMER," Well, the pleasure's all mine.",71
30903,JERRY, You can't take that chemist out.,71
30904,KRAMER, Why not?,71
30905,JERRY, Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.,71
30906,KRAMER, I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.,71
30907,JERRY," Well, I think the whole thing stinks.",71
30908,ELAINE, It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.,71
30909,JERRY, That's enough.,71
30910,ELAINE, What?,71
30911,JERRY, With the smelling.,71
30912,GEORGE," So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.",71
30913,JERRY, Uh-huh.,71
30914,GEORGE," And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.",71
30915,JERRY," Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this?  He's gonna think you're a mental patient.",71
30916,GEORGE," I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me.  My whole life is a lie.",71
30917,ELAINE, Hey!,71
30918,GEORGE, Hey,71
30919,JERRY, Hey.,71
30920,ELAINE," So, guess who called me.",71
30921,GEORGE," Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?",71
30922,ELAINE, We're going out tomorrow night.,71
30923,GEORGE," Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.",71
30924,ELAINE, I can't say that.,71
30925,GEORGE, Why not?,71
30926,ELAINE, What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?,71
30927,GEORGE," So, you're taking his side?",71
30928,ELAINE, No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.,71
30929,GEORGE, Already you're marrying this guy?,71
30930,ELAINE, You never know.,71
30931,GEORGE," All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.",71
30932,ELAINE," All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this?  Even you can't keep that up.",71
30933,JERRY," No, I believe he can.",71
30934,JERRY, Hi!,71
30935,JERRY," Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.",71
30936,JERRY," That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up.  Excuse me one second.",71
30937,ELAINE," You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.",71
30938,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. Big advisor.",71
30939,ELAINE, He tells him which soap to use.,71
30940,JERRY,  What the *beep* are you doing? You little piece of *beep*!,71
30941,KRAMER, Where's the lights. Whoa!,71
30942,KRAMER, Yeah! Bunsen burner.  oo ya ya.,71
30943,KRAMER, Yaow.,71
30944,KRAMER, You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.,71
30945,KRAMER, I hear you.,71
30946,KRAMER," Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?",71
30947,KRAMER," Well, this is in case there's a tie!",71
30948,ELAINE," Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this involuntarily movement. Some sort of a  spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?",71
30949,ELAINE, Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.,71
30950,ELAINE," Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.",71
30951,ELAINE, Really? Wow.,71
30952,ELAINE," No, I'm watching my weight.",71
30953,ELAINE," Yeah, so they say.",71
30954,ELAINE, Yeah. Okay.,71
30955,ELAINE," Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.",71
30956,JERRY,  He said that?,71
30957,ELAINE,"  No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, ""Boy, you're a lot of woman!""",71
30958,KRAMER," Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?",71
30959,JERRY," No, but I expect to hear anytime.",71
30960,KRAMER," Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.",71
30961,JERRY, Why do you say that?,71
30962,KRAMER," No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?",71
30963,ELAINE, No. What about him?,71
30964,KRAMER, You didn't hear?,71
30965,ELAINE, Un-huh.,71
30966,KRAMER, He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.,71
30967,JERRY, Name tags?,71
30968,KRAMER," Yeah! So people can go around saying ""hello"" to one another.",71
30969,JERRY," Oh, I see. So you can go, ""Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!""",71
30970,KRAMER, He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election.  Name tags!,71
30971,JERRY,"  Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye.  Well, the yogurt verdict is in.  Fat!",71
30972,KRAMER, Yeow!,71
30973,GEORGE," The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this.  I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise,  oh.",71
30974,GEORGE," Please, doctor.",71
30975,GEORGE, Yes.,71
30976,GEORGE, Uh-huh.,71
30977,GEORGE, Hmm. Really? Nothing?,71
30978,GEORGE," Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?",71
30979,GEORGE, How so?,71
30980,GEORGE," Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?",71
30981,GEORGE," Now, see here, doctor.",71
30982,GEORGE, Fine.  Ow!,71
30983,ELAINE," Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.",71
30984,JERRY," Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second,  Kramer, turn that up.",71
30985,KRAMER," Huh, Okay.",71
30986,JERRY," Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.",71
30987,ELAINE,  Now look what you've done.,71
30988,JERRY," Well, we've got to do something.  I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.",71
30989,GEORGE, Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.,71
30990,GEORGE, I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An  aaaa . . .,71
30991,JERRY," The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.",71
30992,GEORGE, Phew!,71
30993,ELAINE," Oh, it stinks.",71
30994,KRAMER," Mine, too. I got one more day.",71
30995,JERRY, I can't eat this.,71
30996,JERRY," It had fat in it, it's not good for you.",71
30997,ELAINE," Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this.  Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.",71
30998,JERRY," So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.",71
30999,ELAINE, I wonder what actually happened in that lab.,71
31000,KRAMER," Yeah, me, too.",71
31001,JERRY,"JERRY: The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go ""how do you like crotch?"" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly. ",72
31002,GEORGE, Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious. ,72
31003,GEORGE, I enjoy understanding. ,72
31004,GEORGE, I want you to have this job. Of course... ,72
31005,GEORGE, That's it. ,72
31006,JERRY, What do you mean that's it? ,72
31007,GEORGE," He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview. ",72
31008,JERRY," ""Of course"" was the last thing he said? ",72
31009,GEORGE," Maybe he was going to say ""Of course I have to check with my associates."" ",72
31010,ELAINE," ""I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."" ",72
31011,JERRY," ""I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."" ",72
31012,GEORGE, All right. ,72
31013,ELAINE, Why don't you go ahead and call him? ,72
31014,GEORGE, Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him. ,72
31015,JERRY," So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job. ",72
31016,GEORGE, And if I don't call... ,72
31017,JERRY," You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it? ",72
31018,GEORGE, Rest stop supply. ,72
31019,ELAINE, Good for you.,72
31020,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, yeah.",72
31021,GEORGE, Hey,72
31022,JERRY, Hey,72
31023,KRAMER, Hey. ,72
31024,JERRY, Shower? ,72
31025,KRAMER, Haircut. ,72
31026,JERRY, Oh.,72
31027,KRAMER, I'm very happy with this.,72
31028,JERRY, Who'd you use? Gino? ,72
31029,KRAMER, Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair. ,72
31030,ELAINE, What butcher? ,72
31031,KRAMER, The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses. ,72
31032,JERRY, Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings. ,72
31033,ELAINE, You never get good haircuts. ,72
31034,KRAMER, You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself. ,72
31035,JERRY, Really? ,72
31036,ELAINE," Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction. ",72
31037,KRAMER, What bachelor auction? ,72
31038,ELAINE, Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity. ,72
31039,KRAMER, And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio. ,72
31040,JERRY, I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time. ,72
31041,KRAMER, Polio? ,72
31042,ELAINE, Will you go ahead? You need a haircut. ,72
31043,JERRY, Okay. ,72
31044,KRAMER, What are you all dressed up for? ,72
31045,GEORGE, I had a job interview. ,72
31046,KRAMER, Yeah. How'd it go? ,72
31047,GEORGE, Good. Of course... ,72
31048,JERRY, Oh hi Enzo. ,72
31049,JERRY," No, actually I was just gonna... ",72
31050,JERRY," Well I, if it's your day off I really...  ",72
31051,JERRY, Well I don't want to take too much off. ,72
31052,GEORGE, He massacred you. ,72
31053,JERRY, I know.,72
31054,GEORGE, You look like you're five years old. ,72
31055,JERRY, What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps. ,72
31056,GEORGE, You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship. ,72
31057,JERRY, I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by. ,72
31058,GEORGE," Well, you gotta do it. ",72
31059,JERRY," I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart. ",72
31060,KRAMER, No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo. ,72
31061,JERRY, He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there. ,72
31062,KRAMER, So what? ,72
31063,JERRY, I didn't want to hurt his feelings. ,72
31064,KRAMER, His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself. ,72
31065,JERRY, Yea but...,72
31066,KRAMER, I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will. ,72
31067,JERRY," No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that. ",72
31068,KRAMER," I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up. ",72
31069,JERRY, I don't want you to call him. ,72
31070,KRAMER," All right, geez. You're crazy. ",72
31071,GEORGE, So I still haven't heard about that job. ,72
31072,JERRY, Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that? ,72
31073,GEORGE, I have an idea. ,72
31074,JERRY, Yeah? ,72
31075,GEORGE, I show up. ,72
31076,JERRY, What do you mean you show up? ,72
31077,GEORGE," I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced. ",72
31078,JERRY, Hmm. Not bad. ,72
31079,GEORGE, What's the worst thing that could happen? ,72
31080,JERRY," Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs. ",72
31081,GEORGE," Yeah, so? ",72
31082,JERRY," Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.",72
31083,GEORGE,  Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning.  Good morning. ,72
31084,GEORGE, The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell me where my office is. ,72
31085,GEORGE, Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard. ,72
31086,GEORGE," Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation. ",72
31087,GEORGE, Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office. ,72
31088,GEORGE," Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled. ",72
31089,GEORGE," Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out. ",72
31090,JERRY, So what did you do there all day? ,72
31091,GEORGE, They gave me the Pensky file. ,72
31092,JERRY, So it's a nice place to work? ,72
31093,GEORGE, You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me. ,72
31094,GEORGE,"  I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast. ",72
31095,JERRY, What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you? ,72
31096,GEORGE, He'll be back on Monday. ,72
31097,JERRY, Hi. ,72
31098,ELAINE, Hi. How come you're wearing a hat? ,72
31099,JERRY, I got a haircut. ,72
31100,ELAINE, Oh yeah? Can I see it? ,72
31101,JERRY, Oh there's nothing to see. ,72
31102,ELAINE, Come on. Let me see it. ,72
31103,JERRY, Forget it. ,72
31104,ELAINE, Come on. ,72
31105,JERRY, All right. ,72
31106,JERRY," Alright, that's very good. Thank you.",72
31107,ELAINE,  I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. ,72
31108,JERRY," Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction. ",72
31109,ELAINE," What? No Jerry, you have to go. ",72
31110,GEORGE," You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day. ",72
31111,ELAINE,"  Yeah, too bad. ",72
31112,KRAMER, It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it. ,72
31113,KRAMER, Yeah yeah yeah.,72
31114,KRAMER, I'd like to have shoehorn hands. ,72
31115,KRAMER, Hey.,72
31116,JERRY, Hey,72
31117,KRAMER," Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut. ",72
31118,ELAINE," Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction. ",72
31119,JERRY," Yeah, but how am I... ",72
31120,KRAMER," No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o'clock. ",72
31121,ELAINE, Can he fix it? ,72
31122,KRAMER, I don't know. ,72
31123,JERRY, Oh. thank you. ,72
31124,JERRY, Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while. ,72
31125,JERRY, That's nice of you to say. ,72
31126,JERRY, In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good. ,72
31127,KRAMER," Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive.",72
31128,JERRY, Yeah.,72
31129,KRAMER, I told you he could do it. ,72
31130,JERRY, Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor. ,72
31131,KRAMER," Yeah, so? ",72
31132,JERRY, I think he knew. ,72
31133,KRAMER, No. He doesn't know. ,72
31134,JERRY, Who do you know? He knows my hair. ,72
31135,KRAMER, Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together. ,72
31136,JERRY," Okay, okay. ",72
31137,ELAINE, What happened? It looks the same. ,72
31138,JERRY, He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught. ,72
31139,ELAINE," Jerry, the auction is in a few hours. ",72
31140,JERRY, Take the K-man. ,72
31141,ELAINE, You can still go. ,72
31142,KRAMER, What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque. ,72
31143,ELAINE, You think? ,72
31144,KRAMER, Do I think? He's repugnant. ,72
31145,ELAINE, What would you wear? ,72
31146,KRAMER, Whatever it takes. ,72
31147,GEORGE, Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file? ,72
31148,GEORGE, Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.,72
31149,GEORGE, He's on vacation. ,72
31150,GEORGE, Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog. ,72
31151,GEORGE, Really? ,72
31152,GEORGE, Not now Florice. ,72
31153,GEORGE, I am aware. I am aware. ,72
31154,JERRY, How do you know? ,72
31155,JERRY, Who is it? ,72
31156,JERRY," All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape. ",72
31157,JERRY, What do you want? ,72
31158,JERRY, What's wrong with yours? ,72
31159,JERRY, You can't unclog it? ,72
31160,JERRY, Did you ask Kramer? ,72
31161,JERRY, Number one? ,72
31162,JERRY, All right. Flush twice. ,72
31163,JERRY, All right? ,72
31164,JERRY," All right, I'll see you later. ",72
31165,JERRY, I'm watching Edward Scissorhands. ,72
31166,JERRY, Yeah all right. ,72
31167,JERRY, You want something to drink? ,72
31168,JERRY," If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber. ",72
31169,ELAINE," Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate. ",72
31170,ELAINE," A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much. ",72
31171,ELAINE," Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate. ",72
31172,KRAMER, Equivalency. ,72
31173,ELAINE," Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate.  He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut. ",72
31174,ELAINE," Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks? ",72
31175,JERRY," I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy?  Just asking. ",72
31176,JERRY, Who is it? ,72
31177,JERRY," Oh my god, he knows.  Go.  One second. ",72
31178,JERRY, No I wasn't there.  ,72
31179,JERRY," Sample?  Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book. ",72
31180,GEORGE," Mr. Tuttle, you're back. ",72
31181,GEORGE, You are? ,72
31182,GEORGE, Oh. Really. ,72
31183,GEORGE," Ah, here it is.",72
31184,GEORGE, Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace. ,72
31185,GEORGE, Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office. ,72
31186,GEORGE, You are aware that Pensky is interested in me. ,72
31187,GEORGE,"  Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle. ",72
31188,GEORGE, Obviously. ,72
31189,KRAMER,  So when are you gonna be able to go out?,72
31190,JERRY," If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? ""Oh, he was kind of quiet."" I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes",73
31191,JERRY, No eight years isn't such a long streak. ,73
31192,ELAINE, It isn't? ,73
31193,JERRY, No I haven't vomited in thirteen years. ,73
31194,ELAINE, Get out! ,73
31195,JERRY," Not since June 29, 1980. ",73
31196,ELAINE, You remember the date? ,73
31197,JERRY," Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George",73
31198,ELAINE," Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal. ",73
31199,JERRY, No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York. ,73
31200,ELAINE," Yeah...  Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go.  ",73
31201,ELAINE," Oh, yeah? ",73
31202,ELAINE, Joel... ,73
31203,ELAINE, Uh...  Rifkin. ,73
31204,ELAINE, Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously. ,73
31205,ELAINE, Very funny. That's very funny. ,73
31206,ELAINE, All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough. ,73
31207,ELAINE,"  OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up! ",73
31208,ELAINE," The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin. ",73
31209,JERRY, But you like your Joel Rifkin. ,73
31210,ELAINE, Yeah. I just wish he has a different name. ,73
31211,JERRY, Ask him to change it. ,73
31212,ELAINE, You can't ask a person to change their name. ,73
31213,JERRY, Why not? ,73
31214,ELAINE, Would you change yours? ,73
31215,JERRY, If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld. ,73
31216,ELAINE," Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen? ",73
31217,JERRY, Yeah. Eighteen strangles. ,73
31218,KRAMER, You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted.  Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing.  ,73
31219,ELAINE, You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game. ,73
31220,KRAMER, I'll go. ,73
31221,ELAINE, O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call. ,73
31222,KRAMER, Yeah! Ooh!  ,73
31223,ELAINE, You think I should have asked George? ,73
31224,JERRY, Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen? ,73
31225,ELAINE, Karen? ,73
31226,JERRY, Risotto.  ,73
31227,ELAINE, Oh! The Risotto broad. ,73
31228,JERRY, Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight. ,73
31229,ELAINE, I tought you didn't like double dates. ,73
31230,JERRY," George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality. ",73
31231,ELAINE, I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds. ,73
31232,JERRY," He feels he's funnier, more relaxed. ",73
31233,ELAINE, And you're taking... ,73
31234,JERRY, Jody the masseuse. ,73
31235,ELAINE," Hey, did you get a massage yet? ",73
31236,JERRY, No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage? ,73
31237,ELAINE," Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates. ",73
31238,JERRY, Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex. ,73
31239,ELAINE, So what? ,73
31240,JERRY," So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato. ",73
31241,GEORGE,  So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this  low cut thing. So I said to her,73
31242,GEORGE,  You're listening to this? ,73
31243,JERRY,  My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here. ,73
31244,GEORGE, Well nothing. I didn't actually say that.  ,73
31245,GEORGE," Sweetheart, I was exaggerating. ",73
31246,JERRY,  It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here. ,73
31247,GEORGE, You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket. ,73
31248,GEORGE," Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules.  Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart. ",73
31249,JERRY, Yeah. Let's go. ,73
31250,JERRY, Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen. ,73
31251,GEORGE, Jody let's do this agian real soon  ,73
31252,JERRY, I strained my neck last night. ,73
31253,JERRY, I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work. ,73
31254,JERRY, No deal. Why? ,73
31255,JERRY," Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality. ",73
31256,JERRY, Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense  ,73
31257,JERRY," Yeah, he's disgusting.  ",73
31258,JERRY," Yeah, me either.  ",73
31259,JERRY," Yeah, he's a bad seed. ",73
31260,JERRY, What are you doing? ,73
31261,GEORGE," So, what do you think? ",73
31262,GEORGE, Jody's nice. ,73
31263,GEORGE, You think she liked me? She seemed to like me. ,73
31264,GEORGE, I was personable. Don't you think I was personable? ,73
31265,GEORGE, I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything? ,73
31266,GEORGE," The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face... ",73
31267,GEORGE, I tought I saw a face. ,73
31268,GEORGE, No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend. ,73
31269,GEORGE, He he he he ,73
31270,GEORGE, So you think she likes me? ,73
31271,ELAINE,  Uhh! What are you doing? ,73
31272,ELAINE, Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging. ,73
31273,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon. ",73
31274,ELAINE," Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool. ",73
31275,ELAINE," Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got?  Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great! ",73
31276,GEORGE, She stayed over? ,73
31277,JERRY, Yeah.  ,73
31278,GEORGE, The sex wasn't so good? ,73
31279,JERRY, No. The sex was fabulous. ,73
31280,GEORGE, So? ,73
31281,JERRY, I want the massage! ,73
31282,GEORGE, Did you ask her? ,73
31283,JERRY," I tried putting her hands there  but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it. ",73
31284,GEORGE, Why not? ,73
31285,JERRY, I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating. ,73
31286,GEORGE, So we had a good time... the four of us. ,73
31287,JERRY, Yeah. ,73
31288,GEORGE, We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant. ,73
31289,JERRY, Yeah. ,73
31290,GEORGE, What did Jodi say? ,73
31291,JERRY, She had a good time. ,73
31292,GEORGE, Is that it? ,73
31293,JERRY, Pretty much. ,73
31294,GEORGE," Did she say anything about, uh... ",73
31295,JERRY, What? ,73
31296,GEORGE, Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time. ,73
31297,JERRY, Yeah  ,73
31298,GEORGE, You just hesitated. ,73
31299,JERRY, I was blowing on the coffee. ,73
31300,GEORGE, She didn't like me? ,73
31301,JERRY, Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her. ,73
31302,GEORGE, So she doesn't like me? ,73
31303,JERRY, No. ,73
31304,GEORGE, She said that? ,73
31305,JERRY, Yes. ,73
31306,GEORGE, She told you she doesn't like me! ,73
31307,JERRY, Yes. ,73
31308,GEORGE, What were her exact-- ,73
31309,JERRY," ""I don't like him."" ",73
31310,GEORGE, Uh-Huh  Why didn't she like me? ,73
31311,JERRY, Not everybody likes everybody! ,73
31312,GEORGE, I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice? ,73
31313,JERRY, You were very nice! ,73
31314,GEORGE, I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister? ,73
31315,JERRY, It has nothing to do with her sister. ,73
31316,GEORGE," I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah",73
31317,GEORGE, You vomited in 1987. ,73
31318,JERRY, Oh no. That was the dry heaves. ,73
31319,JERRY, Jodi. ,73
31320,GEORGE, Ha! Ha! Hey!  ,73
31321,JERRY, What are you doing here? ,73
31322,JERRY, Kramer!  ,73
31323,GEORGE, Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you. ,73
31324,GEORGE, Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way.  ,73
31325,JERRY, I'll see you tonight.  ,73
31326,KRAMER, Hey! I am looser than creamed corn! ,73
31327,JERRY, Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet! ,73
31328,KRAMER, You don't know what you're missing buddy. ,73
31329,GEORGE," No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up.  All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me. ",73
31330,GEORGE," Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout.  ",73
31331,KRAMER,"  First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love.  Every muscles she touches just...  ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy.  ",73
31332,JERRY, So you had a good time. ,73
31333,KRAMER, Oh... yeah... ,73
31334,JERRY, Enjoyed yourself. ,73
31335,KRAMER, Very... much... ,73
31336,JERRY, All right now you listen and you listen good!  ,73
31337,KRAMER, What!  ,73
31338,JERRY, The massages are out! ,73
31339,KRAMER, Wha-- ,73
31340,JERRY, Ahh!!! They're out! ,73
31341,KRAMER, Why?! ,73
31342,JERRY," Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one. ",73
31343,KRAMER, Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out! ,73
31344,JERRY," I'm sorry, Kramer.  ",73
31345,KRAMER," Why? Why? Look, I paid for her.  ",73
31346,JERRY, Don't you ever talk about her like that! ,73
31347,KRAMER, But why? ,73
31348,JERRY, That's final!!! ,73
31349,KRAMER, Ah!!! Yahh!!! ,73
31350,ELAINE," Oh, you have photos in your wallet? ",73
31351,ELAINE," No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this? ",73
31352,ELAINE, Oh yeah. I see the resemblance. ,73
31353,ELAINE," Yeah, there is, right here you see-- ",73
31354,ELAINE,  Oh. That's nice. ,73
31355,KRAMER,"  Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer. ",73
31356,KRAMER," Oh, yeah.  You know, I forgot my wallet. ",73
31357,KRAMER, Are you kidding me? ,73
31358,KRAMER," Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer. ",73
31359,KRAMER," Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day. ",73
31360,KRAMER, Where's a phone? ,73
31361,ELAINE,  He's not the murderer. ,73
31362,KRAMER," Oh, God. ",73
31363,JERRY, What's the matter with you? ,73
31364,KRAMER," Jerry, I need another massage! ",73
31365,JERRY, You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for? ,73
31366,KRAMER," Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving. ",73
31367,JERRY, Oh please. ,73
31368,KRAMER," And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me!  It's killing me Jerry! ",73
31369,JERRY," Well, did you get the ball? ",73
31370,KRAMER, Oh I got the ball. ,73
31371,JERRY," Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game. ",73
31372,KRAMER," Well, It's quite a thrill. ",73
31373,JERRY, Why don't you get somebody else? ,73
31374,KRAMER, Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best. ,73
31375,JERRY," Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No ""if and's or but's"". ",73
31376,KRAMER, What about my massage? ,73
31377,JERRY,  Ask Newman. ,73
31378,GEORGE, So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things? ,73
31379,GEORGE," No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table. ",73
31380,GEORGE," Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it! ",73
31381,GEORGE, I wanna know what I did to this woman. ,73
31382,GEORGE," No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other. ",73
31383,GEORGE, Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked! ,73
31384,ELAINE, Of course I support your decision to change your name. ,73
31385,ELAINE," Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin. ",73
31386,ELAINE,  RRR... ,73
31387,ELAINE, Yeah. Yeah. 10 names. ,73
31388,ELAINE," O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it. ",73
31389,ELAINE, O.K. You start. What's your first choice? ,73
31390,ELAINE,  No. Second choice. ,73
31391,ELAINE, I have never met a normal guy named Stuart. ,73
31392,ELAINE,  Todd.  No. Veto. ,73
31393,ELAINE, Great... ,73
31394,ELAINE," I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex. ",73
31395,ELAINE," Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go",73
31396,JERRY, Hi. ,73
31397,JERRY," Ah, no problem. That's fine. ",73
31398,JERRY," That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great!  ",73
31399,JERRY, Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment. ,73
31400,JERRY," No, nonsense. This one's fine.  ",73
31401,JERRY," Go? Why go anywhere?  Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good.  Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice. ",73
31402,JERRY," Why, what's wrong?  ",73
31403,JERRY, No. Yes you can.  ,73
31404,JERRY, Come on! I know it's something you wanna do!  ,73
31405,GEORGE," You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to.  I've got to. ",73
31406,GEORGE, I think I can still catch her. ,73
31407,GEORGE, What? What are you talking about. ,73
31408,GEORGE, I know. I know. ,73
31409,GEORGE,"  I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me.  ",73
31410,GEORGE, That I'm used to.  ,73
31411,ELAINE, What is wrong with Ned? ,73
31412,ELAINE, Ellis. ,73
31413,ELAINE, Ellis and Alex aren't even close. ,73
31414,ELAINE," Ohh, what is the point? ",73
31415,ELAINE, O.K. O.K. Remy. ,73
31416,ELAINE," Oh, Stuart's a lot better!  Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother. ",73
31417,JERRY," What do you mean, no? ",73
31418,JERRY," Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser. ",73
31419,JERRY, Fine. Go. ,73
31420,GEORGE," Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please? ",73
31421,JERRY, What for? ,73
31422,GEORGE, We need to talk. ,73
31423,JERRY, You need to talk? ,73
31424,GEORGE, Look it's no secret what's going on between us.  She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind. ,73
31425,JERRY," George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me. ",73
31426,GEORGE,  Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her. ,73
31427,JERRY, What? ,73
31428,GEORGE, She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable. ,73
31429,JERRY, I can see that. ,73
31430,JERRY, Don't worry.  ,73
31431,GEORGE, A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime. ,73
31432,JERRY, You're a lucky guy. ,73
31433,GEORGE, I got to go after her. ,73
31434,JERRY, George. I wouldn't push for the massage.  ,73
31435,GEORGE, JODI!  ,73
31436,JERRY," The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go ""Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."" ",73
31437,JERRY,"JERRY: You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.' ",74
31438,JERRY, How would you describe the smell in this house? ,74
31439,ELAINE,  Dandruff? ,74
31440,JERRY," Yeah, that's part of it.  Kasha? ",74
31441,ELAINE, There's some kasha. ,74
31442,JERRY," Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really. ",74
31443,ELAINE," Alright, let's go, come on. ",74
31444,GEORGE, Wha... you're going? ,74
31445,ELAINE," Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late. ",74
31446,KRAMER, Egh. These aren't candies. ,74
31447,GEORGE, Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps!  ,74
31448,KRAMER, Well I'm a guest. ,74
31449,GEORGE, Now my parents are gonna know I had people over. ,74
31450,JERRY, You're not allowed to have people over? ,74
31451,GEORGE, I can't have any parties while they're out of town.  ,74
31452,KRAMER," What, this is a party? ",74
31453,ELAINE," Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go. ",74
31454,GEORGE,  Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table! ,74
31455,JERRY,"  I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table. ",74
31456,GEORGE," But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain!  ",74
31457,KRAMER," Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh? ",74
31458,ELAINE,  Come on! ,74
31459,JERRY, What's the big rush? ,74
31460,ELAINE, I'm having people over. ,74
31461,JERRY, Who? ,74
31462,ELAINE," The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona... ",74
31463,JERRY," Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there? ",74
31464,ELAINE, Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy. ,74
31465,JERRY,  Really? ,74
31466,ELAINE, I'll put in a good word for you. ,74
31467,JERRY," Thanks, because I would really like...  ",74
31468,GEORGE,  Aaahh!! ,74
31469,JERRY," Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  ",74
31470,GEORGE," But Jerry, this is not coming out! ",74
31471,JERRY, Just put a coffee table book over it. ,74
31472,GEORGE, My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table! ,74
31473,KRAMER," Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it? ",74
31474,ELAINE," Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George. ",74
31475,GEORGE," Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished. ",74
31476,ELAINE, Now?! ,74
31477,GEORGE," Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them! ",74
31478,ELAINE," Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven. ",74
31479,KRAMER," Alright, we'll take the subway. ",74
31480,JERRY, There you go. That'll get you home in time. ,74
31481,ELAINE, Oh! The subway? From Queens? ,74
31482,GEORGE," Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat. ",74
31483,JERRY," I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you. ",74
31484,ELAINE, I need something to read on the subway. ,74
31485,JERRY,"  Here, read this. ",74
31486,ELAINE,  TV Guide? ,74
31487,KRAMER," Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told. ",74
31488,ELAINE,  Hmm-mmm. ,74
31489,KRAMER," So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh? ",74
31490,ELAINE,  Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning. ,74
31491,KRAMER,  Yes indeed. ,74
31492,KRAMER," Oh, Queensboro Plaza.  This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one? ",74
31493,ELAINE, How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time? ,74
31494,KRAMER," Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go.  Three dollars, no change. You want one? ",74
31495,ELAINE,  No thanks. ,74
31496,KRAMER," Alright, but no bites. ",74
31497,ELAINE, Excuse me? ,74
31498,ELAINE," Ah. Uh, look really  I'm just trying to read. ",74
31499,KRAMER,  Elaine! ,74
31500,ELAINE, He's not my boyfriend. ,74
31501,JERRY," Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something. ",74
31502,GEORGE, Why? ,74
31503,JERRY," Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me? ",74
31504,GEORGE, Can't hurt you. ,74
31505,JERRY," What about, what about this thing? ",74
31506,GEORGE, The Indian? ,74
31507,JERRY," Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute. ",74
31508,GEORGE," Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back. ",74
31509,ELAINE," Oh,  my stop.  Bye-bye. ",74
31510,GEORGE," No, it's, it's his.  ",74
31511,GEORGE," Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner. ",74
31512,GEORGE,"  Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing. ",74
31513,JERRY," Alright, I'll take it. ",74
31514,GEORGE," Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them. ",74
31515,ELAINE, Knocked you out Jack. Pair of deuces ,74
31516,ELAINE,"  Ha, ha, ha ha! ",74
31517,ELAINE, Who is it? ,74
31518,ELAINE, Jerry! ,74
31519,JERRY, Surprise!  ,74
31520,ELAINE, What is this? ,74
31521,JERRY," Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something. ",74
31522,ELAINE," Oh, you did?  Oh, do you guys all know Jerry? ",74
31523,JERRY, Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again. ,74
31524,ELAINE, No. ,74
31525,JERRY," I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy. ",74
31526,JERRY, Are you ready? ,74
31527,ELAINE, Yeah. ,74
31528,JERRY,  Ta-da! ,74
31529,JERRY, It's a cigar store Indian.  Read the card. ,74
31530,ELAINE,  That's very nice. Thank you very much. ,74
31531,JERRY, Read it out loud. ,74
31532,ELAINE," I, I don't think so. ",74
31533,JERRY,  We had a little fight this afternoon.  Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe. ,74
31534,ELAINE," I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh... ",74
31535,JERRY," Hey-yah, ho-ah, hey-yah, ho-ah. ",74
31536,ELAINE, Are you out of your mind?! ,74
31537,JERRY," ...ho-ah. It's, it's, it's kitschy. ",74
31538,ELAINE, Winona is a Native American. ,74
31539,JERRY, She is? ,74
31540,GEORGE,  I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled. ,74
31541,GEORGE, I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block. ,74
31542,GEORGE,"  No, that's me. ",74
31543,GEORGE," Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house. ",74
31544,GEORGE, The Ray Conniff Singers.  ,74
31545,GEORGE," It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom?  ",74
31546,JERRY," Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld. ",74
31547,JERRY," Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up? ",74
31548,KRAMER, I came by to get my ball. ,74
31549,ELAINE, It's right over there. ,74
31550,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, thanks.  Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh?  Yo! Where did this come from? ",74
31551,ELAINE, You want it? ,74
31552,KRAMER,  I can have this?! ,74
31553,ELAINE," Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours. ",74
31554,KRAMER, Oh. I'll lug. ,74
31555,JERRY," And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya? ",74
31556,JERRY," You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address...  Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here. ",74
31557,JERRY," I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood. ",74
31558,JERRY, I didn't know that... ,74
31559,JERRY," I, I had no idea. ",74
31560,KRAMER,  Hey Jerry!  Look what I got!  ,74
31561,GEORGE, Looks pretty good. ,74
31562,JERRY," Yeah, did a good job. ",74
31563,GEORGE, Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell. ,74
31564,JERRY," You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle. ",74
31565,GEORGE," So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh... ",74
31566,JERRY," Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight. ",74
31567,GEORGE," Oh, great. ",74
31568,JERRY," Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake. ",74
31569,GEORGE, Aw c'mon. ,74
31570,GEORGE,"  Ahh, hey you're home. Hi. ",74
31571,GEORGE," Yeah, huh. ",74
31572,JERRY, Hello. ,74
31573,GEORGE," So, how was the trip? ",74
31574,GEORGE, What TV Guide? ,74
31575,JERRY," Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway. ",74
31576,GEORGE, I didn't know she took it! ,74
31577,JERRY," Wa, it's two weeks old. ",74
31578,GEORGE,  He collects them. ,74
31579,JERRY, You collect TV Guide? ,74
31580,GEORGE," I don't know, uh... ",74
31581,JERRY, I'll see you later.  ,74
31582,GEORGE, Yes! ,74
31583,GEORGE,"  Well, my bed is too small. ",74
31584,GEORGE, What are you talking about? ,74
31585,GEORGE, Of course you can. ,74
31586,GEORGE,"  You can't ground me, I'm a grown man. ",74
31587,JERRY, I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest. ,74
31588,JERRY," Ah, don't worry. I made reser...  ",74
31589,JERRY," I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats. ",74
31590,JERRY," Got 'em on the street, from a scal...  ",74
31591,JERRY," A uh, one of those guys. ",74
31592,JERRY," You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events. ",74
31593,JERRY," Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide. ",74
31594,JERRY," Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this? ",74
31595,JERRY, Thanks. ,74
31596,JERRY," So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you. ",74
31597,ELAINE," Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh? ",74
31598,JERRY, Yeah. You almost ruined his life's work. ,74
31599,ELAINE, He collects  these? ,74
31600,JERRY, Yeah. ,74
31601,ELAINE," Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him. ",74
31602,JERRY, What'ya do with the one you took? ,74
31603,ELAINE, I dunno. ,74
31604,ELAINE, Hi. ,74
31605,KRAMER," Yeah uh, Elaine uh, what'd he say? ",74
31606,ELAINE, What did who say? ,74
31607,KRAMER, Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book? ,74
31608,ELAINE, Uhmm... ,74
31609,KRAMER," Yeah, you didn't tell him didya? ",74
31610,ELAINE," Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be  totally embarrassed to bring it... ",74
31611,KRAMER,"  Wait a minute, on the cover I'm... ",74
31612,ELAINE, I would be embarrassed to bring it up. ,74
31613,JERRY," I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table. ",74
31614,KRAMER," Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster.  Alright, well I'm gonna go. ",74
31615,JERRY, Where you going? ,74
31616,KRAMER," Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian. ",74
31617,JERRY, My Indian? ,74
31618,KRAMER," You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy.  ",74
31619,GEORGE, Yeah. ,74
31620,JERRY," Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions. ",74
31621,JERRY, Why? ,74
31622,JERRY," Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father. ",74
31623,JERRY," You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you...  ",74
31624,JERRY," A uh, a person that uh... ",74
31625,JERRY," Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh... ",74
31626,JERRY," ...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to. ",74
31627,JERRY," I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term. ",74
31628,ELAINE, Hello.  ,74
31629,ELAINE,"  I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one.  ",74
31630,ELAINE,"  Oh, thank you. ",74
31631,KRAMER," I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly. ",74
31632,KRAMER, Forget it. ,74
31633,KRAMER," Oh yeah, yeah. ",74
31634,KRAMER, Giddyup. ,74
31635,KRAMER, Pendant Publishing? Giddyup again. ,74
31636,ELAINE," Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh...  Kramer! ",74
31637,KRAMER," Yeah, hi Elaine. ",74
31638,ELAINE, What are you doing in here with that? ,74
31639,KRAMER," Ah, well, it's a business transaction. ",74
31640,KRAMER," Yeah, I'm sure it's all here.  You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall. ",74
31641,KRAMER, You mind if I use it in my book? ,74
31642,KRAMER," Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables. ",74
31643,KRAMER, Uh huh. ,74
31644,KRAMER," Well, I'm still shopping it around. ",74
31645,ELAINE, Well I  ...manuscript that I... ,74
31646,JERRY, I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide. ,74
31647,ELAINE, I dunno. ,74
31648,JERRY," Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy.  ",74
31649,ELAINE, I guess. ,74
31650,JERRY, What's the matter? ,74
31651,ELAINE, What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book. ,74
31652,JERRY," It is a good idea, Elaine. ",74
31653,JERRY, You want a gyro? ,74
31654,ELAINE, I don't think so. ,74
31655,JERRY, Elaine! ,74
31656,ELAINE, He's not my boyfriend. ,74
31657,JERRY," I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?'  'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents? ",74
31658,JERRY," You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But it’s really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesn’t it? ""I really am a doctor you know. You think I’m not, just check it out."" I don’t know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. ""Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and I’ll give you my opinion."" After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what they’re talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants. ",75
31659,GEORGE," Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable.  Ooh, a little expensive. ",75
31660,GEORGE," Yes, well, you know, I’m not thinking about the price. You know you’re the only woman I’ve never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster. ",75
31661,GEORGE, We do? ,75
31662,GEORGE, Why? ,75
31663,GEORGE," Um, you know I’m starting to think that maybe lobster isn’t the way to go. ",75
31664,JERRY, Then he asked you out? ,75
31665,ELAINE," We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart. ",75
31666,JERRY, On your heart? ,75
31667,ELAINE," Jerry, the man is a doctor. ",75
31668,JERRY, Doctor? He’s a podiatrist. ,75
31669,ELAINE," So, it’s the same thing. ",75
31670,JERRY, Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school. ,75
31671,ELAINE, Really? ,75
31672,JERRY, Oh hi. ,75
31673,JERRY," Yes, I’ll be stopping. ",75
31674,JERRY, See you later.  Well we can’t all be dating podiatrists. ,75
31675,GEORGE, It’s over. ,75
31676,ELAINE, What? ,75
31677,JERRY, How did you get in? ,75
31678,GEORGE, Kramer. ,75
31679,ELAINE, What’s that? ,75
31680,GEORGE, Lobster. ,75
31681,JERRY, Looks like a swan. ,75
31682,GEORGE, She says we can’t go out anymore. ,75
31683,ELAINE, Why? ,75
31684,GEORGE, Because I’m not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents won’t let her get involved with anyone who isn’t Latvian Orthodox. ,75
31685,ELAINE," Latvian Orthodox?  Mmm, it is lobster. ",75
31686,JERRY, She’s limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad. ,75
31687,GEORGE, I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well that’s not entirely true. ,75
31688,JERRY," Oh, whatever.",75
31689,ELAINE," Mmm, this is delicious. ",75
31690,JERRY," Mmm, succulent. ",75
31691,GEORGE," She knew I didn’t have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didn’t seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman. ",75
31692,ELAINE, Why don’t you just ask her parents? ,75
31693,GEORGE," I can’t. I met them. They’re devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting. ",75
31694,JERRY, To Latvian Orthodox? ,75
31695,GEORGE, Why not? What do I care? ,75
31696,JERRY, You know it’s not like changing toothpaste. ,75
31697,ELAINE, I think it would be romantic. ,75
31698,GEORGE, Really? ,75
31699,ELAINE," Yeah, it’s like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh. ",75
31700,GEORGE," King Edward.  King Edward, Jerry. ",75
31701,JERRY, Yeah well King Edward didn’t live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza. ,75
31702,GEORGE, You know what? I could probably do this. What’s the difference. ,75
31703,ELAINE, George I was just kidding around. ,75
31704,GEORGE, No. I wouldn’t even have to tell her. I could surprise her. ,75
31705,ELAINE, George I wasn’t serious. ,75
31706,GEORGE," How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this. ",75
31707,ELAINE, I guess this one is my fault. ,75
31708,JERRY, Oh yeah. ,75
31709,JERRY," Oh I don’t know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing. ",75
31710,JERRY, To wash my hands. They’re sticky from the orange. ,75
31711,JERRY, Right there. ,75
31712,JERRY,"  ""Fungicide"". Fungus? ",75
31713,JERRY, Fungicide. I mean what could she have? ,75
31714,ELAINE, I don’t know. ,75
31715,KRAMER, Fungus. ,75
31716,JERRY, Exactly,75
31717,ELAINE, So what did you say? ,75
31718,JERRY, I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home. ,75
31719,ELAINE," I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet? ",75
31720,JERRY, I didn’t open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little. ,75
31721,ELAINE, You were snooping. ,75
31722,JERRY, I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldn’t do that. ,75
31723,KRAMER, I would. I always open medicine cabinets. ,75
31724,ELAINE, Well I trust people not to do that. ,75
31725,KRAMER, Big mistake. ,75
31726,JERRY, Why don’t you ask that doctor what it is? ,75
31727,ELAINE, What? Now he’s a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist. ,75
31728,JERRY, But that’s what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. They’re knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus. ,75
31729,ELAINE, I am not going to ask him about funguses. ,75
31730,KRAMER, Fungi. ,75
31731,JERRY, What? ,75
31732,KRAMER, Fungi. ,75
31733,GEORGE,"  In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um…  ",75
31734,GEORGE, No. ,75
31735,GEORGE, No not vast  ,75
31736,GEORGE, Yes. ,75
31737,GEORGE,  I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious. ,75
31738,GEORGE," Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah. ",75
31739,GEORGE," Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that. ",75
31740,GEORGE," Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in? ",75
31741,GEORGE," Ah hah. You see Father, I’m I’m incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, don’t you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change? ",75
31742,GEORGE, Nice nun. ,75
31743,KRAMER," Oh yeah, I’m here to pick up my friend George Costanza. ",75
31744,KRAMER, Oh yeah. ,75
31745,KRAMER, Oh. Kramer. Pleasure. ,75
31746,GEORGE," I can’t believe how easy it is. I’m virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and I’m in the club. ",75
31747,JERRY, That’s all there is to it. ,75
31748,GEORGE, That’s all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza. ,75
31749,JERRY, And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza? ,75
31750,GEORGE, Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence. ,75
31751,JERRY, Oh a slinky.,75
31752,KRAMER, Sister Roberta gave it to me. ,75
31753,JERRY, Why did she give you that? ,75
31754,KRAMER, I think she liked me. ,75
31755,JERRY, What do you mean she liked you? ,75
31756,KRAMER, Liked me. ,75
31757,GEORGE," Kramer, they like everybody. They’re friendly people. ",75
31758,KRAMER, No. I think I picked up on a vibe. ,75
31759,JERRY," You picked up on a vibe, from a nun. ",75
31760,KRAMER," Yeah, Jerry I’m telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it. ",75
31761,JERRY, Yea alright. ,75
31762,KRAMER," Oh, that's my phone.",75
31763,JERRY, Oh hi. ,75
31764,JERRY,  A little better.  ,75
31765,JERRY, Okay.,75
31766,JERRY, All right.,75
31767,JERRY, Bye.,75
31768,GEORGE, Story. ,75
31769,JERRY, She’s subletting Carol’s place for a month. ,75
31770,GEORGE," Yea, she likes you. ",75
31771,JERRY, Yeah but there’s a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet. ,75
31772,GEORGE, So? ,75
31773,JERRY, So I don’t know what she’s using it for. ,75
31774,GEORGE, Well how do you even know it’s hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube? ,75
31775,JERRY, I didn’t even think to look. ,75
31776,GEORGE, Well take a look. It might not even belong to her. ,75
31777,JERRY, Yeah. ,75
31778,GEORGE, People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet. ,75
31779,JERRY, Yeah I’ve got this old bottle of cough medicine. ,75
31780,GEORGE, I still have brill cream. ,75
31781,JERRY, Hi,75
31782,JERRY, Hi. Can I use your bathroom? ,75
31783,ELAINE, You sure you don’t mind? ,75
31784,ELAINE, Well I mean the question isn’t even for me it’s for a friend. ,75
31785,ELAINE, Well… podiatrist. ,75
31786,ELAINE," No no, I’m just saying you didn’t really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which I’m sure is very grueling in it’s own way. ",75
31787,ELAINE, I like feet too. I’m just saying… ,75
31788,JERRY," Fine all done, just looking for the soap. ",75
31789,JERRY, No I don’t see it. ,75
31790,GEORGE, What? Nothing. ,75
31791,GEORGE, I’m fine. ,75
31792,GEORGE, Nothing. ,75
31793,GEORGE, No. ,75
31794,GEORGE, No! ,75
31795,KRAMER, Hey. ,75
31796,JERRY," Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And I’ll need that in the form of a question. ",75

31818,JERRY, How do you know? ,75
31819,KRAMER, She told me. She said she’s never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. She’s questioning her faith. She’s thinking of leaving the church. ,75
31820,JERRY, Wow,75

31836,KRAMER, The priests they’re helping me. I just bathed in vinegar. ,75
31837,JERRY, You know you’re funcifying the whole building. ,75

31859,KRAMER, You don’t? ,75
31860,KRAMER, Yeah yeah. ,75
31861,JERRY," But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, ""Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on.""",75
31862,GEORGE, Well I didn’t do it for my mother. ,75

31865,GEORGE, I’d like a doggie bag for this please. ,75
31866,JERRY, The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.,76
31867,ELAINE," Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here ",76
31868,ELAINE, yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some.,76

31874,ELAINE," No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you ",76
31875,JERRY,  hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent ,76

31877,ELAINE, hey ,76
31878,ELAINE, what? ,76

31880,ELAINE, 3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares! ,76
31881,ELAINE," I was begging her ""please! please!"" she was insane ",76
31882,JERRY, who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out ,76
31883,JERRY, I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony ,76

32106,JERRY, oh you're crazy ,76
32107,KRAMER, Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind? ,76
32108,JERRY, It's impossible ,76
32109,KRAMER, iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top? ,76
32110,JERRY, it can't be ,76
32111,KRAMER, Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you? ,76
32112,JERRY, alright that's enough ,76

32118,ELAINE," yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway ",76
32119,JERRY, oh I though you didn't care about his looks ,76

32121,JERRY, aha ,76
32122,ELAINE," are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony , I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry ",76

32129,JERRY, how's you get her to meet here? ,76
32130,KRAMER," I don't know, we have a certain chemistry ",76
32131,JERRY, oh my god ,76

32140,ELAINE," that's right honey, and I know you! ",76
32141,ELAINE," here, take it ",76
32142,JERRY, thanks,76
32143,JERRY," Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going ""boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly."" ",76
32144,JERRY,"It is my opinion that we never should have landed a man on the moon. It's a mistake. Now everything is compared to that one accomplishment. Now every body goes “I can't believe they could land a man on the moon . . . and taste my coffee!” I think we all would have been a lot happier if we hadn't landed a man on the moon. Then we'd go, They can't make a prescription bottle top that's easy to open? I'm not surprised they couldn't land a man on the moon. Things make perfect sense to me now. Neil Armstrong should have said, ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for every whining, complaining, SOB on the face of the earth.""",77
32145,ELAINE," Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.",77
32146,JERRY, I once got Happy New Yeared in March.,77
32147,ELAINE, It's disgusting.,77
32148,JERRY," It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?",77
32149,ELAINE, Really cold.,77
32150,JERRY, Scary cold.,77
32151,ELAINE, I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?,77
32152,JERRY, That. ,77
32153,ELAINE,"  What is that, ha?",77
32154,GEORGE, What?,77
32155,JERRY, When did you get that?,77
32156,GEORGE, This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?,77
32157,JERRY," You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?",77
32158,ELAINE," Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.",77
32159,JERRY, Look at this,77
32160,ELAINE," Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...",77
32161,GEORGE," All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.",77
32162,ELAINE, Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.,77
32163,JERRY, Yeah. ,77
32164,GEORGE, What for?,77
32165,ELAINE, These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.,77
32166,GEORGE, Why?,77
32167,ELAINE," Because it's rude, otherwise.",77
32168,GEORGE," You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?",77
32169,ELAINE, Yes.,77
32170,GEORGE," So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?",77
32171,JERRY, The fabric of society is very complex George.,77
32172,GEORGE, I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.,77
32173,ELAINE, Ya can't bring Pepsi. ,77
32174,GEORGE, Why not?,77
32175,ELAINE, Because we're adults?,77
32176,GEORGE," You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh , no way wine is better than Pepsi.",77
32177,JERRY," I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.",77
32178,GEORGE, I just don't like the idea that any time there’s a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.,77
32179,JERRY," You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.",77
32180,KRAMER," All right, let's go. Who's driving? ",77
32181,JERRY, You are. I can't get that thing in my car. ,77
32182,KRAMER, Uh huh.,77
32183,JERRY," Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze.",77
32184,ELAINE," Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!",77
32185,GEORGE, Hehehehehe ,77
32186,JERRY," You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?",77
32187,GEORGE," Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.",77
32188,ELAINE," You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.",77
32189,GEORGE," Oh, here we go...",77
32190,ELAINE, What?,77
32191,GEORGE, Why don't we get them a couch?  We’ll rent a U-haul -- we’ll bring ‘em a nice sectional.,77
32192,KRAMER, Yeahhehehehe,77
32193,ELAINE, We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?,77
32194,KRAMER,"  All right, yeah.",77
32195,GEORGE, Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?,77
32196,ELAINE, Ring Dings?,77
32197,GEORGE," Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.",77
32198,KRAMER, Ooooh I like Ring Dings.,77
32199,ELAINE," George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.",77
32200,KRAMER, HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! ,77
32201,GEORGE,"  It's a funeral procession. . . .  And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, ""just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .",77
32202,ELAINE," Oh, Kramer, that’s the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.",77
32203,KRAMER,  All right.,77
32204,ELAINE," Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is…",77
32205,JERRY, Jerry.,77
32206,ELAINE," Yeah, Jerry, Jerry -- come with me.",77
32207,KRAMER," Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.",77
32208,ELAINE, Yeah.,77
32209,KRAMER, All right,77
32210,ELAINE," Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.",77
32211,JERRY," Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.",77
32212,ELAINE, Mmm.,77
32213,JERRY, I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?,77
32214,ELAINE, You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.,77
32215,JERRY, I'm looking forward to it.,77
32216,ELAINE, Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.,77
32217,JERRY," Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?",77
32218,ELAINE, CHOCOLATE BABKA! That's their specialty.,77
32219,JERRY, Love that babka.,77
32220,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah!",77
32221,JERRY," So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.",77
32222,ELAINE, Why?,77
32223,JERRY," I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.",77
32224,ELAINE, You think it's effeminate?,77
32225,JERRY, It's a tad dainty.,77
32226,ELAINE," Oh, we forgot to pick a number.",77
32227,JERRY," Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.",77
32228,ELAINE, I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?,77
32229,JERRY," Ah, no, forget it.",77
32230,ELAINE," No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask ‘em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.",77
32231,KRAMER,"  Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?",77
32232,GEORGE," Ah, Just double park.",77
32233,KRAMER," No, no.",77
32234,GEORGE, Why not?,77
32235,KRAMER," I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?",77
32236,GEORGE," Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give ‘em up.",77
32237,KRAMER, That's a fallacy.,77
32238,GEORGE," All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?",77
32239,KRAMER, Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?,77
32240,GEORGE," Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.",77
32241,KRAMER, So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.,77
32242,GEORGE, Does the heater even work in this car?,77
32243,KRAMER, No.,77
32244,GEORGE," Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see",77
32245,KRAMER, I see.,77
32246,GEORGE," You see, hu, ho ho.",77
32247,ELAINE, But we were here ahead of you.,77
32248,JERRY, Well we saw you come in.,77
32249,ELAINE," Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.",77
32250,ELAINE," Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?",77
32251,ELAINE," Oh my god. I, I know you. I-I’m, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.",77
32252,ELAINE, Yeah me too.,77
32253,JERRY, David!,77
32254,ELAINE," Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?",77
32255,ELAINE," You know we were here, ahead of you.",77
32256,JERRY, Oh so you still don't believe us.,77
32257,ELAINE," Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.",77
32258,GEORGE," Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!",77
32259,KRAMER," Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?",77
32260,GEORGE, What's that?,77
32261,KRAMER," Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars.",77
32262,GEORGE, Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you they’re not getting no twelve dollar cake.,77
32263,KRAMER," All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.",77
32264,GEORGE, . . . Why not?,77
32265,KRAMER, Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. ,77
32266,GEORGE," ""throws your hips off kilter"" So where's your money? ",77
32267,KRAMER, I never take it.,77
32268,GEORGE, So what do you do?,77
32269,KRAMER," Oh, I get by.",77
32270,JERRY, That's the last babka. They got the last babka.,77
32271,ELAINE, I know. They're going in first with the last babka.,77
32272,JERRY, That was our babka.,77
32273,ELAINE, You can't beat a babka.,77
32274,JERRY, We had that babka.,77
32275,ELAINE,  They're going to be heroes.,77
32276,JERRY, Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.,77
32277,ELAINE, Well how about a carrot cake?,77
32278,JERRY, Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.,77
32279,ELAINE, Black Forrest?,77
32280,JERRY," Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.",77
32281,JERRY, How about a Napoleon?,77
32282,ELAINE, Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.,77
32283,JERRY, That was our babka. We had that babka!,77
32284,ELAINE, What's this one?,77
32285,ELAINE, ,77
32286,JERRY, Another babka?,77
32287,JERRY, Well-well we got to get the cinnamon.,77
32288,ELAINE," No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.",77
32289,JERRY," I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, ""Oh This is so good. What's in it?"" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.",77
32290,ELAINE, I'll have a cinnamon babka.,77
32291,JERRY," … and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!",77
32292,GEORGE, All right here you go.,77
32293,KRAMER, Yeuu.,77
32294,GEORGE," You can't - huhu, All right let's go.",77
32295,KRAMER, Wait a second. I can get change.,77
32296,KRAMER," Hey, anybody got change for a hundred?",77
32297,GEORGE, Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!,77
32298,KRAMER, What?,77
32299,GEORGE, Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.,77
32300,KRAMER," Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.",77
32301,GEORGE, I am not buying something just to get change.,77
32302,KRAMER," George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.",77
32303,GEORGE," All right, what are we doing?",77
32304,KRAMER, Just get some gum or something.,77
32305,GEORGE, Pack of gum. Here you go. ,77
32306,GEORGE, Why not?,77
32307,KRAMER," Here, get a newspaper. ",77
32308,GEORGE, Newspaper.,77
32309,KRAMER, Clark Bar. ,77
32310,GEORGE, Clark Bar.,77
32311,GEORGE, We’re up to two dollars here.,77
32312,KRAMER," Here, George, get a Penthouse Forum.",77
32313,GEORGE, I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.,77
32314,KRAMER," Why? No, that’ll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.",77
32315,GEORGE," Oh, that's nice.",77
32316,KRAMER," Come on, did you ever read one of these?",77
32317,GEORGE, It's not real. They're all made up.,77
32318,KRAMER," Ohh, it's real.",77
32319,GEORGE," Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES!  . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.",77
32320,GEORGE," Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.",77
32321,KRAMER," All right, all right.",77
32322,GEORGE," Yes, I’m Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex.",77
32323,KRAMER, You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.,77
32324,JERRY," Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.",77
32325,ELAINE," Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. ",77
32326,JERRY, Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.,77
32327,ELAINE,  Well what is this?,77
32328,JERRY, What?,77
32329,ELAINE, It's a hair.,77
32330,JERRY," Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.",77
32331,ELAINE," No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.",77
32332,JERRY," No no come on really, get another one. It’ll take a second.",77
32333,ELAINE," Alright, alright.",77
32334,ELAINE, Excuse me.,77
32335,ELAINE," No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a  hair on it.",77
32336,ELAINE, We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing  you’re gonna wait now?,77
32337,JERRY," Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.",77
32338,ELAINE, Well it was a little hair. I took it off.,77
32339,JERRY, A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?,77
32340,ELAINE, What if it's your hair?,77
32341,JERRY, What if it's your hair?,77
32342,ELAINE,  What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.,77
32343,JERRY," Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. ",77
32344,ELAINE," Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.",77
32345,JERRY," Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?",77
32346,ELAINE, No I'm bringing cake! ,77
32347,GEORGE, All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!,77
32348,KRAMER,"  ""I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true…""  "" A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was…""",77
32349,GEORGE, L-Look at this?,77
32350,KRAMER, Ahh.,77
32351,GEORGE," Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?",77
32352,KRAMER," ""…well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out…."" ",77
32353,GEORGE, I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?,77
32354,KRAMER," No, no I can't comprehend it?",77
32355,GEORGE, I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?,77
32356,KRAMER," Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.",77
32357,GEORGE, So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.,77
32358,KRAMER," Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?",77
32359,GEORGE, Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?,77
32360,KRAMER," How about Idi Amin, huh?",77
32361,GEORGE," I’ll tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!",77
32362,KRAMER, Are those shoes comfortable?,77
32363,GEORGE, No not really.,77
32364,KRAMER, Cause they look comfortable.,77
32365,GEORGE, I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.,77
32366,ELAINE, Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?,77
32367,JERRY, No. That’s out of the question.,77
32368,ELAINE, Whhhy?,77
32369,JERRY, Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.,77
32370,ELAINE, What happened?,77
32371,JERRY, I'd rather not talk about it.,77
32372,ELAINE, You can't tell me?,77
32373,JERRY, All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.,77
32374,ELAINE, You found a hair in your Farina?,77
32375,JERRY, Yeah.,77
32376,ELAINE, What happened?,77
32377,JERRY," Well I started screaming, ""There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina."" Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running  and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.",77
32378,ELAINE,  Wow. Who's hair was it?,77
32379,JERRY, My mother's.,77
32380,ELAINE,  Ahhhhh,77

32384,JERRY," Oh, that's lovely.",77
32385,ELAINE," Ah,",77
32386,JERRY," That’s what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.",77
32387,JERRY," Yeah that’s a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.",77
32388,ELAINE, Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?,77
32389,KRAMER," HEY DOUBLE-PARKER!  SHOW YOURSELF.  COME ON OUT, I’M FREEZING! ",77
32390,GEORGE, We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.,77
32391,KRAMER, Why?,77
32392,GEORGE, You know -- Elaine.,77
32393,KRAMER, What about her?,77
32394,GEORGE, . . . I'm a little scared of her.,77
32395,KRAMER, You're scared of Elaine?,77
32396,GEORGE, Yes!,77
32397,KRAMER, Why?,77
32398,GEORGE," Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.",77
32399,KRAMER," Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. I’m freezin in here.",77
32400,GEORGE, Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?,77
32401,KRAMER, Because I wanted to look good for the party.,77
32402,GEORGE," Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!",77
32403,GEORGE, I wasn't talking to you.,77
32404,ELAINE," Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.",77
32405,JERRY," Huh, wa?",77
32406,ELAINE, What's the matter with you?,77
32407,JERRY," I don’t know, I don't feel so good.",77
32408,ELAINE, What's wrong?,77
32409,JERRY," My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.",77
32410,ELAINE, The black and white?,77
32411,JERRY, Yeah.,77
32412,ELAINE, Not getting’ along?,77
32413,JERRY, I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.,77
32414,ELAINE,  “Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?”,77
32415,JERRY, Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.,77
32416,ELAINE," Wait, what about your vomit streak?",77
32417,JERRY," I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.",77
32418,ELAINE," Oh, oh! Ooh my god. Oh!",77
32419,ELAINE," Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC!… ",77

32421,JERRY, Fourteen years down the drain. ,77
32422,GEORGE, Do you think chickens have individual personalities?,77
32423,KRAMER,  I don't know.,77
32424,GEORGE," If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities I’m not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?",77
32425,KRAMER,  Waj cha jia ja,77
32426,GEORGE," Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.",77
32427,GEORGE, But my friend here has hypothermia.,77
32428,KRAMER,  Hypothermia.,77
32429,ELAINE, How was it?,77
32430,JERRY, As good as it gets.,77
32431,GEORGE," You know that coat was Gore-Tex. It’s worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay.",77
32432,KRAMER,  You know I'm freezin. I’m definitely freezin. I can't stop shaking.,77
32433,GEORGE, I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.,77

32436,JERRY," Oh, no thanks.",77
32437,GEORGE," S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though.",77

32444,ELAINE, Cinnamon babka.,77
32445,GEORGE, Cinnamon? Why didn't ‘cha get chocolate?,77
32446,JERRY, George!,77

32449,ELAINE, See ya'.,77
32450,JERRY, See ya'.,77
32451,JERRY,"JERRY: I love these nature shows, I’ll watch and kind of nature show, and it’s amazing how you can always relate, to whatever they’re talking about. You know like you’re watching the African Dung Beetle and you’re going “Boy, his life is a lot like mine.” And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if it’s the antelope, and there’s a lion chasing the antelope you go, “Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away!” But the next week it’s the lion, and then you go “Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, don’t let him use his speed!”",78
32452,ELAINE,  Well did he bring it up in the meeting?,78
32453,JERRY," Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him… Golden Boy.",78

32456,ELAINE," No thanks.  Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.",78
32457,JERRY," But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.",78
32458,ELAINE, Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?,78
32459,JERRY," No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!",78
32460,ELAINE," Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! that’s fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye.  Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!",78

32463,JERRY, You wanna barrow Golden Boy!,78
32464,ELAINE," Oh!  Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!",78
32465,JERRY," Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for ""War and Peace"" was ""War--What Is It Good For?""!",78
32466,ELAINE, ...  ....Ha ha ha ha.,78

32642,JERRY," Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?",78
32643,ELAINE," What, how did you know that?",78
32644,JERRY, Because I know who has it.,78
32645,ELAINE,  How did you find it?,78
32646,JERRY," Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!",78
32647,ELAINE,"  Where is it, give it to me!",78
32648,JERRY, I don't have it!,78
32649,ELAINE, Why not.,78
32650,JERRY, Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.,78
32651,ELAINE," But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!",78
32652,JERRY, How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?,78
32653,ELAINE, One million.,78
32654,JERRY, Well that's a start.,78
32655,GEORGE," Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.",78
32656,GEORGE," Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.",78
32657,GEORGE," But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah… architecture. Huhu. ",78
32658,JERRY, You know what room Testikov's in?,78
32659,ELAINE," Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!",78
32660,JERRY," Well, you want your organizer back don't you?",78
32661,ELAINE, Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?,78
32662,JERRY, Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!,78
32663,ELAINE," Well, you're not Superman.",78
32664,JERRY, Well you're not Lois Lane.,78
32665,ELAINE," Oh. Listen, you got the tape-recorder.",78
32666,JERRY, Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? ,78
32667,ELAINE," Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the ""New England Journal Of Medicine"" I'm not gonna pay for it.",78
32668,JERRY," Oh, here she comes.",78
32669,JERRY, Hi.,78
32670,JERRY," Elaine, this is Corinne.",78
32671,ELAINE," Hi,  you got the organizer?",78
32672,JERRY," All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.",78
32673,GEORGE," Oh, they're busting!",78
32674,ELAINE," Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know , single women in a big city can be dangerous, so…",78
32675,JERRY," Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. ",78
32676,JERRY, Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.,78
32677,ELAINE, Hmm. ,78
32678,ELAINE,  OK.,78
32679,JERRY, It was nice meeting you…,78
32680,JERRY, … you’re a real pleasure. ,78
32681,ELAINE," Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?",78
32682,ELAINE,"  Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.",78
32683,JERRY, Right in the head! ,78
32684,ELAINE, Boing! Hehe hehe. ,78
32685,ELAINE, Oh that’s nothing. Um and anyway um…,78
32686,ELAINE," No, No that's my purse!",78
32687,ELAINE," No, get-get off my purse!",78
32688,ELAINE, No that's… Radio!,78
32689,GEORGE," So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment … I was a Marine Biologist!",78
32690,ELAINE," George I’ve just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!",78
32691,GEORGE, I know I was just telling them the story.,78
32692,KRAMER," Well come on George, finish the story.",78
32693,GEORGE, The sea was angry that day my friends… like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!,78
32694,GEORGE," I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, ""Easy big fella!"" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its’ breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!",78
32695,JERRY, Mammal.,78
32696,GEORGE, Whatever.,78
32697,KRAMER," Well then, what did you do next?",78
32698,GEORGE," Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him,  face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there… so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!",78
32699,KRAMER, What is that a Titleist?,78
32700,GEORGE, ,78
32701,KRAMER, A hole in one eh.,78
32702,JERRY, Well the-the crowd must have gone wild!,78
32703,GEORGE," Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me…",78
32704,KRAMER,  Um-hm.,78
32705,GEORGE," …kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.",78
32706,JERRY, Wow! What'd she say?,78
32707,GEORGE," Told me to ""Go to hell!"" and I took the bus home.",78
32708,JERRY, All right lets go.,78
32709,ELAINE," What, are you in a bad mood?",78
32710,JERRY, Ahhh… got my laundry back.,78
32711,ELAINE, Ohhh! Golden Boy?,78
32712,JERRY, He didn't make it.,78
32713,ELAINE, I'm sorry. ,78
32714,JERRY, Yea.  This is Golden Boy's son… Baby Blue.,78
32715,KRAMER,  What's with you?,78
32716,GEORGE, Sand. It's everywhere,78
32717,KRAMER, Yep.,78
32718,JERRY,"JERRY: Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. ""What ever happened to Bob?"" ""Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face."" Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. ""Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived.""",79
32719,JERRY, Yeah. are you full? ,79
32720,JERRY," Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city.  Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some. ",79
32721,JERRY, You're not gonna have any? ,79
32722,JERRY, Do you not like apple pie? ,79
32723,JERRY," Well, at least taste it. ",79
32724,JERRY, You won't even taste it? ,79
32725,JERRY," Come on, try it!  A little taste!  Come on.  ",79
32726,JERRY, She wouldn't so much as taste it.,79
32727,GEORGE, Did she say why? ,79
32728,JERRY, No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this  ,79
32729,GEORGE, Maybe she's diabetic. ,79
32730,JERRY, No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse. ,79
32731,GEORGE, Maybe you said something that offended her. ,79
32732,JERRY, The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city. ,79
32733,GEORGE, Like at the airport?  ,79
32734,JERRY, Yeah. ,79
32735,GEORGE, That's a great idea!!! ,79
32736,JERRY, Tell me about it! ,79
32737,GEORGE, We could be zipping all over the place. ,79
32738,JERRY, They could at least try it. ,79
32739,GEORGE, They never try anything. ,79
32740,JERRY, What's the harm? ,79
32741,GEORGE, No harm! ,79
32742,JERRY,  I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie. ,79
32743,ELAINE, Who wouldn't taste a pie? ,79
32744,JERRY, Audrey. ,79
32745,ELAINE, Dump her. ,79
32746,JERRY," Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie??? ",79
32747,ELAINE,  I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie. ,79
32748,JERRY, You did? ,79
32749,ELAINE," He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness. ",79
32750,GEORGE," Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways.  What are you doing? ",79
32751,ELAINE, I got a pebble. ,79
32752,JERRY," Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman? ",79
32753,ELAINE, What the hell does that mean? ,79
32754,KRAMER, Hey! Elaine. Go Like this.  ,79
32755,ELAINE, What? Why? ,79
32756,KRAMER, Do it. Do it. This. ,79
32757,ELAINE, Like...  Like this? ,79
32758,KRAMER, Oh yeah! It's you! ,79
32759,ELAINE, What's me? ,79
32760,KRAMER,  There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine. ,79
32761,ELAINE, Get out! ,79
32762,KRAMER," It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite. ",79
32763,GEORGE," Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin? ",79
32764,KRAMER, Rinitze.  Oh yeah... ,79
32765,JERRY,  Uh... may I help you?  ,79
32766,KRAMER," It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it. ",79
32767,GEORGE," Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there? ",79
32768,KRAMER, Real Boss! ,79
32769,ELAINE, I'm going down there. ,79
32770,GEORGE," I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday. ",79
32771,ELAINE,  Let's go. ,79
32772,GEORGE, All right. All right.  ,79
32773,KRAMER,  Are you gonna need this? ,79
32774,JERRY, Keep it.  ,79
32775,ELAINE, It looks exactly like me. ,79
32776,GEORGE, It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine. ,79
32777,ELAINE, What's going on here? How do you think this happened? ,79
32778,GEORGE," Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh? ",79
32779,ELAINE, You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible? ,79
32780,GEORGE, You think so? ,79
32781,ELAINE,  Excuse me. Where did this come from? ,79
32782,GEORGE, You really think this looks O.K. on me? ,79
32783,ELAINE, I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from? ,79
32784,ELAINE,"  Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know? ",79
32785,ELAINE, Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me. ,79
32786,ELAINE,"  Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you. ",79
32787,ELAINE," What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress?  Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags.  I'll meet you outside. ",79
32788,GEORGE," Ah, Pfft! What can you do?  Is this the price tag? ",79
32789,GEORGE," Yes, hello. Party's over.  ",79
32790,GEORGE, So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me? ,79
32791,GEORGE," Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair.  ",79
32792,ELAINE," So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up. ",79
32793,KRAMER," Well, how did they get your face? ",79
32794,ELAINE, I don't know. They wouldn't tell me.  Jerry? Je... Hello? ,79
32795,JERRY,  Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie. ,79
32796,JERRY, And you waved it away. ,79
32797,JERRY, Did you give her a reason? ,79
32798,JERRY, You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head. ,79
32799,JERRY," Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip.  Well, I think we proven who the psycho is. ",79
32800,ELAINE, We certainly have. ,79
32801,KRAMER," Hey, Elaine scratch my back. ",79
32802,ELAINE, No way! ,79
32803,KRAMER," Come on, one lap around. ",79
32804,ELAINE, No. ,79
32805,KRAMER, It will be a funky adventure. ,79
32806,ELAINE," Kramer, forget it. ",79
32807,KRAMER," Jerry, how about you? ",79
32808,JERRY, I think you know my policy. ,79
32809,KRAMER, I'm going home to spatula.  ,79
32810,ELAINE, I thought George was meeting us here? ,79
32811,JERRY, No he's going downtown to guard the suit. ,79
32812,ELAINE, He's guarding a suit? ,79
32813,KRAMER," Madam, I pray you're not toying with me.  Whoa. ",79
32814,KRAMER," Oh, all right.  ",79
32815,GEORGE,  What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second?  Can I help you? ,79
32816,GEORGE," No, no, no, this suit is not for sale.  ",79
32817,GEORGE,  No. ,79
32818,GEORGE," Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday. ",79
32819,GEORGE, Yea Yea Yea,79
32820,GEORGE, Yes. Now take off those pants. ,79
32821,GEORGE,"  You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it. ",79
32822,JERRY, I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here? ,79
32823,JERRY, You've tasted them? ,79
32824,JERRY, Oh I see they have apple pie. ,79
32825,JERRY, You've had the apple pie? ,79
32826,JERRY," Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind. ",79
32827,JERRY,  Why can't I know? ,79
32828,JERRY, Hello Poppie. ,79
32829,JERRY, The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know.  ,79
32830,JERRY, Huh? ,79
32831,JERRY," No, Nothing. ",79
32832,KRAMER, Hey. These are for you Olive. ,79
32833,KRAMER, Ohh! ,79
32834,JERRY, So she tought I did it to get back at her ,79
32835,GEORGE, Why didn't you just tell her? ,79
32836,JERRY," I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene. ",79
32837,GEORGE, How could he not have washed? ,79
32838,JERRY," Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something. ",79
32839,GEORGE," Yeah, just like I do. ",79
32840,JERRY," You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught. ",79
32841,GEORGE," Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it? ",79
32842,JERRY, We haven't spoken. ,79
32843,KRAMER," Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive.  ",79
32844,GEORGE, Olive? ,79
32845,KRAMER, Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks. ,79
32846,GEORGE, Oh.,79
32847,KRAMER," You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen. ",79
32848,GEORGE, I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes. ,79
32849,KRAMER, Is that Elaine mannequin still there? ,79
32850,GEORGE, Yeah. ,79
32851,KRAMER, Yeah.,79
32852,GEORGE," The last time I saw her, she was naked. ",79
32853,JERRY," Yeah, and Poppie's got problems... ",79
32854,GEORGE,"  Well, look at this.  This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake. ",79
32855,GEORGE," Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it. ",79
32856,GEORGE," Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short. ",79
32857,ELAINE," So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects. ",79
32858,JERRY," Yeah, all right. Go ahead.  ",79
32859,ELAINE," There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose. ",79
32860,JERRY,"  Hum... ok, what else you got? ",79
32861,ELAINE," OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list. ",79
32862,JERRY," Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it? ",79
32863,ELAINE, Because you have an attitude. ,79
32864,JERRY, Georgio! Nice duds! ,79
32865,GEORGE," You're telling me.  So, what do you think? ",79
32866,JERRY, Did you hear something? ,79
32867,ELAINE," Yeah, like a swoosh. ",79
32868,JERRY, Yeah. ,79
32869,ELAINE,  It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound. ,79
32870,GEORGE, I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise.  This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour! ,79
32871,JERRY, So what? What would they care? ,79
32872,GEORGE," This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed. ",79
32873,JERRY, So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise? ,79
32874,GEORGE," Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire? ",79
32875,JERRY," You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts. ",79
32876,KRAMER," Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before. ",79
32877,JERRY, Audrey? ,79
32878,KRAMER," Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie. ",79
32879,JERRY, Was it apple? ,79
32880,KRAMER, What else? ,79
32881,JERRY, This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel! ,79
32882,ELAINE, Hmm... No you don't. ,79
32883,ELAINE, The mannequin! ,79
32884,JERRY," Oh, I got to see this thing. ",79
32885,JERRY," Boy, the resemblance is uncanny. ",79
32886,ELAINE, You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window! ,79
32887,ELAINE," No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges.  Yes, this is my attorney. ",79
32888,JERRY," Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney, ",79
32889,ELAINE, Uh-huh ,79
32890,JERRY, The Charlie Macarthy hearings. ,79
32891,ELAINE, Uh-huh. Are you taking this down? ,79
32892,ELAINE, Jerry get the car.  ,79
32893,JERRY, What are you doing? ,79
32894,ELAINE, Just get the car! ,79
32895,JERRY," Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this. ",79
32896,JERRY," I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right? ",79
32897,ELAINE, Where are you going? ,79
32898,JERRY, Poppie's ,79
32899,GEORGE," No, I didn't hear anything. ",79
32900,GEORGE," No, can't say as I did. ",79
32901,GEORGE, Could be the leaves... ,79
32902,JERRY, Hello. ,79
32903,JERRY, So how was the pie? ,79
32904,JERRY, The apple pie you had today at Monks ,79
32905,JERRY," Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it. ",79
32906,JERRY," Oh, about the... uh  ",79
32907,JERRY," Well, Poppie's a little sloppy. ",79
32908,GEORGE, I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted. ,79
32909,GEORGE, No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me. ,79
32910,GEORGE, Oh...  ,79
32911,JERRY, So you didn't get the job. ,79
32912,GEORGE, No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill. ,79
32913,JERRY," Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something. ",79
32914,KRAMER, What am I supposed to say? ,79

32987,JERRY, Who couldn't.,80
32988,JERRY," Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle.  You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other.  Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.",80
32989,JERRY," Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....",80
32990,GEORGE,  So how were the eggs?,80
32991,GEORGE,"  Eggs are eggs. That is very profound.  By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so.  Listen Dophne",80
32992,GEORGE," Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...",80
32993,GEORGE," Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?",80
32994,GEORGE, What?,80
32995,GEORGE, He said that?  What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.,80
32996,GEORGE," Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.",80
32997,KRAMER, Yo,80
32998,KRAMER,  That's good work.,80
32999,KRAMER,"  I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.",80

33014,JERRY," No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.",80
33015,ELAINE, If you were a woman would you go out with him?,80
33016,JERRY, If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.,80
33017,ELAINE,"  Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.",80
33018,JERRY, Alright.,80

33021,GEORGE, Ya. That's what she told me.,80

33026,ELAINE, So?,80
33027,GEORGE, Wa.. He doesn't have to tell her.,80
33028,ELAINE, Maybe he likes her.,80
33029,GEORGE," Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.",80
33030,JERRY, So what are you gonna do?,80
33031,GEORGE, Well I can't break up with her now.,80
33032,JERRY, Why?,80
33033,GEORGE, Because he said I was going to.,80
33034,ELAINE," So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?",80
33035,GEORGE," Yes, I am.",80
33036,JERRY," Ya, I could see that.",80
33037,GEORGE, I don't see any way around it.,80
33038,JERRY," No, me either.",80
33039,GEORGE, What choice do I have?,80
33040,JERRY, None.,80

33145,GEORGE,"  Oh, please don't.",80
33146,GEORGE, Packyderm?,80
33147,JERRY,"I think that of all the places that you go all the time, the dry-cleaning relationship is one of the most bizarre. Because you keep giving each other the same thing, back and forth, over and over again. He gives it to you, you give it to him, he gives it back to you. It's like it's half his shirt, in a way. He has it as much as you do...you oughta go shopping with him. 'What do you think of this shirt?' 'That would look good with a light starch.' The only warning label people really respect is 'dry-clean only.' Ya know what I mean? Speed limits, lung cancer, cigarette warnings - your very life is at stake! People go, 'Ah, the hell with it!' But dry-clean only? 'Oh, don't put that in the wash! It's dry-clean only! Are you crazy?!'",81
33148,JERRY, Good morning.,81
33149,JERRY," Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.",81
33150,JERRY," C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!",81
33151,JERRY," No, no, 12-8!",81
33152,JERRY," I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.",81
33153,JERRY," Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor.  Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.",81
33154,JERRY," No, gore-tex. It's new.  Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.",81
33155,JERRY," No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.",81
33156,JERRY, Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?,81
33157,JERRY," Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.",81
33158,JERRY," But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.",81
33159,JERRY," Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9.  Hey, how ya doin.'",81
33160,KRAMER, We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.,81
33161,JERRY," Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. ",81
33162,KRAMER, Got to.,81
33163,JERRY," Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?",81
33164,JERRY," Oh, wow.",81
33165,JERRY," Oh, come on!",81
33166,JERRY, It's silly!,81
33167,JERRY, Get outta here!,81
33168,JERRY," Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.",81
33169,JERRY," You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...",81
33170,JERRY," Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you... I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!",81
33171,ELAINE," Oh, hi Greg.",81
33172,ELAINE," Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.",81
33173,ELAINE," No, but I exercised that day. ",81
33174,ELAINE," Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it.  Um, do you have the time?",81
33175,ELAINE, Oh.,81
33176,ELAINE, No.,81
33177,ELAINE," I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.",81

33184,JERRY," Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.",81
33185,KRAMER," Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too?",81
33186,JERRY," No, just Meryl.",81
33187,KRAMER," Why, why? Why does she get it?",81
33188,JERRY, Because she's my wife!  Yeh?,81
33189,ELAINE,  Meh.,81
33190,JERRY,"  Eh.  You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying ""my wife."" Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - ""my wife"" this, ""my wife"" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.",81
33191,KRAMER," ""My wife has an inner ear infection.""",81
33192,JERRY, See?,81
33193,KRAMER," I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?",81
33194,JERRY," Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!",81
33195,KRAMER," C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive!",81
33196,JERRY, Alright. ,81
33197,KRAMER," Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?",81

33199,KRAMER," We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. ",81
33200,ELAINE," Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?",81
33201,JERRY, The fly-boy.,81
33202,ELAINE, Yeah.,81
33203,JERRY," Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.",81
33204,ELAINE," I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.",81
33205,JERRY," Hmm, So?",81
33206,ELAINE, So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.,81
33207,JERRY, Really.,81
33208,ELAINE," Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.",81
33209,JERRY," Ohhh, moisture?",81
33210,ELAINE, Yeah. Definite moisture.,81
33211,JERRY," That's an open-lip kiss, alright.",81
33212,ELAINE," Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship.  Yeah?",81
33213,ELAINE," Hey, what happened to you?",81
33214,ELAINE," Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.",81
33215,GEORGE," Can I come upstairs, please? ",81
33216,JERRY," I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.",81
33217,ELAINE," Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.",81
33218,JERRY," Yeah, so?",81
33219,ELAINE," I respect that.  Mmm, what happened?",81
33220,GEORGE," Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.",81
33221,ELAINE, Yeah? What was it?,81
33222,JERRY, Here we go.,81
33223,GEORGE," Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.",81
33224,ELAINE, You went...in the shower?,81
33225,GEORGE," Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! ",81
33226,JERRY," No, never.",81
33227,KRAMER, I take baths.,81
33228,GEORGE," Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?",81
33229,ELAINE, Did you ever hear of...holding it in?,81
33230,GEORGE," Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.",81
33231,ELAINE, How do you know?,81
33232,GEORGE, Medical journals!,81
33233,JERRY, Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?,81
33234,JERRY, Hello.,81
33235,JERRY, What are you doing here?,81
33236,JERRY," Oh.  Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. ",81
33237,JERRY, Uncle Leo?!,81
33238,JERRY, Hello.,81

33242,JERRY," Yes, yes, you have.",81
33243,JERRY," You did, you did.",81
33244,JERRY, I'm a good printer.,81
33245,JERRY," Uncle Leo, wait!",81
33246,ELAINE, I can find out.,81
33247,ELAINE," Sure.  Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.",81
33248,ELAINE," Oh, thanks.  That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.",81
33249,ELAINE,"  Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out.  Um, you know Greg, I...",81
33250,ELAINE," Oh, yeah, sure. ",81
33251,ELAINE,  Oh my God.,81
33252,ELAINE," Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. ",81
33253,ELAINE," Yup, you mean him?",81
33254,JERRY," Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.",81
33255,JERRY, I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.,81
33256,JERRY," Listen, Ma...",81
33257,JERRY," Mom, I'm not married.",81
33258,JERRY, I'm not married!,81
33259,JERRY, I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.,81
33260,JERRY," Well, whoopie whoop. ",81
33261,KRAMER, Got any coffee?,81
33262,JERRY," Yeah.  I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?",81
33263,KRAMER," My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold.  I can't get into a zone!",81
33264,JERRY, What is that? ,81
33265,KRAMER, Huh?,81
33266,JERRY, That?,81
33267,KRAMER," Oh, I forgot. ",81
33268,JERRY," Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.",81
33269,JERRY, I Love you.,81
33270,JERRY, Goodnight. ,81
33271,GEORGE, They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!,81
33272,ELAINE, So what do you want me to do?,81
33273,GEORGE, Talk to him!,81
33274,ELAINE, How can I do that?,81
33275,GEORGE, You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!,81
33276,GEORGE," Well, that doesn't mean anything!",81
33277,ELAINE," Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!",81
33278,GEORGE," Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?",81
33279,JERRY,  Bottle-wipe supercedes it.,81
33280,GEORGE," Yeah, you're right, you're right.  Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?",81
33281,ELAINE," George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.",81
33282,GEORGE, Why?,81
33283,ELAINE, I...I don't know...,81
33284,GEORGE," Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!",81
33285,ELAINE," No, that's not it!",81
33286,GEORGE," Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!",81
33287,ELAINE, Why couldn't you just wait?,81
33288,GEORGE, I was there! I saw a drain!,81
33289,ELAINE, Since when is a drain a toilet?!,81
33290,GEORGE, It's all pipes! What's the difference?!,81
33291,ELAINE, Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!,81
33292,GEORGE, I'll call a plumber right now! ,81
33293,JERRY," Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?",81
33294,KRAMER," Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.",81
33295,JERRY, Alright.,81
33296,KRAMER," Well, you gotta pick it up for me!",81
33297,JERRY," Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!",81
33298,KRAMER, I'm so tired!,81
33299,KRAMER, Huh? I don't?,81
33300,ELAINE," No, you look pale.",81
33301,KRAMER, Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! ,81
33302,JERRY," Hello? Oh, hi honey.  Yes, I told him. I'll get it.  Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...",81
33303,KRAMER, Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?,81
33304,JERRY," He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.",81
33305,JERRY," Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.",81
33306,KRAMER," Alright, I'm gonna see you later.",81
33307,JERRY, Where you goin'?,81
33308,KRAMER," I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.",81
33309,JERRY, I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.,81
33310,KRAMER," Hey, that's how I maintain my glow.",81
33311,JERRY, I'm goin' home.,81
33312,KRAMER, Ya.,81
33313,ELAINE," Hi, Greg.",81
33314,ELAINE," Ok.  I got the machine next, buddy. ",81
33315,GEORGE, What happened? Did he bring it up?,81
33316,ELAINE," Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.",81
33317,GEORGE, Signal? What signal?,81
33318,ELAINE," Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.",81
33319,GEORGE, I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!,81
33320,ELAINE," Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.",81
33321,GEORGE," A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?",81
33322,ELAINE, Yeah! It's a social thing.,81
33323,GEORGE," What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!",81
33324,ELAINE, No! I won't be a party to this.,81
33325,GEORGE, So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?,81
33326,ELAINE," Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. ",81
33327,JERRY, I want to!,81
33328,JERRY, Give me the clothes.,81
33329,JERRY," Oh, the hell with her. ",81
33330,JERRY, I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.,81
33331,JERRY, Do you want box or hanger?,81
33332,ELAINE," You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?",81
33333,ELAINE, Are you sure you want to do that?,81
33334,ELAINE, You're interested in...in her? ,81
33335,ELAINE," Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged.  Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. ",81
33336,ELAINE," You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.",81
33337,ELAINE," Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?",81
33338,ELAINE," Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.",81
33339,JERRY, I'm sorry.,81
33340,JERRY, It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.,81
33341,JERRY," Yes, that's right.",81
33342,JERRY, I'll tell you what happened. We got married.,81
33343,JERRY, No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.,81
33344,JERRY," It's alright, I want you to have it.",81
33345,JERRY, We'll always have...pancakes.,81
33346,JERRY,"I really feel as human beings, we need more training in our basic social skills. Conversational Distance, don't you hate these people that talk to you they talk into your mouth like you're a clown at a drive-through and Hand shakes is the worst, there's absolutely no guidelines for hand shakes you know these people? Too long, too weak, sometimes they give you the three-quarter handshake just the fingers, early release, late release, sometimes people will dispute your release, you let go there're hangin' on. I have actually said to people 'Hey the handshake is over!.' Too many pumps, coming in too high, too sweaty, coming from too far away. Sometimes a guy will give you a strong grip, late release, and pull you in for the too close conversation. To him I say 'That's three strikes you're out.'",82
33347,JERRY, You know their timing couldn't be worse.,82
33348,GEORGE, Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?,82
33349,JERRY," You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.",82
33350,GEORGE, When are they leaving for Paris?,82
33351,JERRY, Not for another three days.,82
33352,GEORGE, What about her place?,82
33353,JERRY, She lives with her parents.,82
33354,GEORGE," Really?  Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.",82
33355,JERRY,"  Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.",82
33356,GEORGE," Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?",82
33357,JERRY, The baldies,82
33358,GEORGE, Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.,82
33359,JERRY," That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.",82
33360,GEORGE, Hey Alec,82
33361,JERRY, Hey Alec,82
33362,GEORGE," Hey Joey, how you doin'?",82
33363,GEORGE, Well uh....,82
33364,GEORGE," Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.",82
33365,JERRY, What happened?,82
33366,GEORGE, What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?,82
33367,JERRY,  Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?,82
33368,JERRY, Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?,82
33369,GEORGE, Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.,82
33370,JERRY," Ya, it's much better isn't it?",82
33371,GEORGE," Oh, n-no comparison.",82
33372,JERRY," Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.",82
33373,GEORGE,  Hey hey hey hey hey hey.,82
33374,JERRY, What?,82
33375,GEORGE, Your parents are going to Paris right?,82
33376,JERRY, Yea?,82
33377,GEORGE, So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.,82
33378,JERRY, What about little Joey?,82
33379,GEORGE, Who?,82
33380,JERRY," Ah, I think he's probably better off.",82
33381,GEORGE, I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris  all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.,82
33382,GEORGE," Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps  I-I'll reimburse you of course.",82
33383,JERRY, He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.,82
33384,JERRY, Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.,82
33385,KRAMER," Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?",82
33386,KRAMER,  Ya,82
33387,KRAMER, Mmm  I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.,82
33388,JERRY," Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.",82
33389,KRAMER, Ya,82
33390,KRAMER," Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.",82
33391,GEORGE," Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?",82
33392,KRAMER," Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.",82
33393,GEORGE," What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?",82
33394,KRAMER, Well I suppose the children do.,82
33395,GEORGE,  Yes I suppose they do.,82
33396,KRAMER,"  Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.",82

33532,JERRY, Name it.,82
33533,GEORGE, You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them?  It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris.  Is that a coincidence?  Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going ,82
33534,JERRY," So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?",82
33535,GEORGE,  Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.,82
33536,ELAINE," Well first we're going to a matinée, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see ""My Fair Lady"" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.",82

33711,GEORGE, Where the hell is your father?!,82
33712,JERRY,"To me, the thing about birthday parties is that the first birthday party you have and the last birthday party you have are actually quite similar. You know, you just kinda sit there...you're the least excited person at the party. You don't even really realize that there is a party. You don't know what's goin' on. Both birthday parties, people have to kinda help you blow out the candles, you can't do it...you don't even know why you're doing it. What is this ritual? What is going on? It's also the only two birthday parties where other people have to gather your friends together for you. Sometimes they're not even your friends. They make the judgement. They bring 'em in, they sit 'em down, and they tell you - 'these are your friends! Tell them thank you for coming to my birthday party.'",84
33713,KRAMER, It was there!,84
33714,ELAINE," You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...",84
33715,KRAMER," Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?",84
33716,JERRY," Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny -  ""Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest.""",84
33717,JERRY," You don't know? Come on, that's gold!",84
33718,ELAINE," Well, I don't know about ""gold.""",84
33719,JERRY," Oh, that's gold, baby.",84
33720,ELAINE," 'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?",84
33721,JERRY, I was saying 'baby' way before George!,84
33722,ELAINE," Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me.",84

33791,GEORGE, B-O-Z-O?,84
33792,GEORGE, You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?,84
33793,GEORGE, How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?,84
33794,GEORGE, How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?,84
33795,GEORGE," Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?",84
33796,GEORGE," Yes, he's a clown!",84
33797,GEORGE," Alright, just forget it.",84
33798,GEORGE," Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric!  What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?",84
33799,GEORGE," Well, I do what I can. ",84
33800,GEORGE," Ah, great, great.  What's that smell? Smoke?  Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here... FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!",84
33801,GEORGE," Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?",84
33802,GEORGE," Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?",84
33803,GEORGE, Its not easy.,84
33804,GEORGE, So she doesn't want to see me anymore.,84
33805,JERRY," Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?",84
33806,GEORGE," No, her too. And her mother.",84
33807,JERRY, Really? Her mother.,84
33808,GEORGE," Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.",84
33809,JERRY, You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.,84
33810,GEORGE, Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.,84
33811,JERRY," Hmm. So you feel ""women and children first,"" in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.",84
33812,GEORGE, To some degree.,84
33813,JERRY," So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.",84
33814,GEORGE, In a manner of speaking.,84
33815,JERRY," Yeah, well, it's honest.",84
33816,GEORGE, Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.,84
33817,JERRY," Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.",84
33818,GEORGE, Perhaps.,84
33819,JERRY," So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?",84
33820,GEORGE, Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.,84
33821,JERRY," By the way, did you see this? ",84
33822,GEORGE, What's that?,84
33823,JERRY," It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.",84
33824,GEORGE," Wow, he really does a number on you.  ""Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling.""",84
33825,JERRY, I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.,84
33826,GEORGE, You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.,84
33827,JERRY," Yeah, right.",84
33828,GEORGE," You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'",84
33829,JERRY," Yeah, that'd be something.",84
33830,GEORGE," I'm not kidding, you should do it.",84
33831,JERRY, But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.,84
33832,GEORGE," Well, go ahead! Do it!",84
33833,JERRY, Why can't I?,84
33834,GEORGE, No reason!,84
33835,JERRY," You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!",84
33836,GEORGE, This is unprecedented!,84
33837,JERRY," There's no precedent, baby!",84
33838,GEORGE, What...are you using my babies now?,84
33839,JERRY," Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'",84
33840,JERRY," Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?",84
33841,JERRY," Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!",84
33842,KRAMER," Hey, what's going on?",84
33843,JERRY, Boo!,84
33844,KRAMER, What's happenin' here?,84
33845,JERRY, Hiss!,84
33846,KRAMER,  Toby! Toby!,84
33847,KRAMER,"  Toby!  Oh, Oh!",84
33848,KRAMER, What did you go up there to heckle her for?,84
33849,JERRY, Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! ,84
33850,KRAMER," Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.",84
33851,JERRY," Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.",84
33852,GEORGE, What accident?,84
33853,KRAMER," Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.",84
33854,GEORGE, That's unbelievable!,84
33855,KRAMER," Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.",84
33856,GEORGE, Wha.. you ran?,84
33857,KRAMER," No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, ""I got a toe here, buddy - step on it.""",84
33858,GEORGE, Holy cow!,84
33859,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, ""Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?"" I said, ""Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - ""  - knocked him out cold!",84
33860,GEORGE, How could you do that?!,84
33861,KRAMER," Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.",84
33862,GEORGE, You're Batman.,84
33863,KRAMER," Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.",84
33864,JERRY, You kept makin' all the stops?,84
33865,KRAMER," Well, people kept ringin' the bell!",84
33866,GEORGE," Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?",84
33867,KRAMER, Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.,84
33868,GEORGE, You did all this...for a pinky toe?,84
33869,KRAMER," Well, it's a valuable appendage.",84
33870,ELAINE, Really.,84
33871,ELAINE, I know.,84
33872,JERRY, She got the promotion?,84
33873,JERRY, Why?,84
33874,ELAINE," I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.",84
33875,JERRY, Too bad.,84
33876,ELAINE," Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?",84
33877,JERRY," Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'",84
33878,ELAINE, Why don't you just shut the f-,84
33879,ELAINE," Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??",84
33880,KRAMER," Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.",84
33881,ELAINE," Oh, wonderful!",84
33882,KRAMER," You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.",84
33883,ELAINE," Oh, of course! She's deranged.",84
33884,JERRY," I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.",84
33885,JERRY, Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!,84
33886,JERRY," Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.",84
33887,JERRY," Yeah, well, it won't be long.",84
33888,JERRY, Gotta go. ,84
33889,GEORGE, Robin? Robin!,84
33890,GEORGE," Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.",84
33891,GEORGE, O.k....,84
33892,JERRY," I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need ""the clown"" in his title, as clown? Bozo, ""the"" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...",84
33893,GEORGE," ...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.",84
33894,GEORGE," Alright, but I'm serious about this.",84
33895,JERRY, ...that's why men hunt and women nest.,84
33896,GEORGE," The prop comic?  Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?",84
33897,JERRY, George - could I have a word?,84
33898,JERRY,"I find the human fascination with water is amazing. We're constantly going to beaches, pools, lakes, rivers, we're swimming, we're snorkeling, we're-we're scuba diving, we bathe in it, our bodies are mostly made of water, everyone is caring around these bottles of water. We can't get enough water, unless it rains then we're like, ""Oh, look I'm soaked. I am literally drenched."" For some reason we have a huge problem with small flying water. I-It'll just stop us right in our tracks. ""Uh, I felt a drop, We're gonna get caught in it! Everyone cover your water bottles, run!!""													 ",85
33899,KRAMER," All right, get off at the next exit.",85
33900,JERRY," Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.",85
33901,KRAMER," It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.",85
33902,JERRY,  You sure we're makin' the right move?,85
33903,ELAINE," We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.",85
33904,JERRY, Didn't they just have a baby?,85
33905,ELAINE," That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'",85
33906,JERRY, Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?,85
33907,KRAMER," Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?",85
33908,JERRY, No.,85
33909,KRAMER, Put that on the top of your list.,85
33910,JERRY," No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.",85
33911,ELAINE," Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?",85
33912,JERRY," I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.",85
33913,ELAINE, When's Rachel comin' out?,85
33914,JERRY, She's makin' the three o'clock train.,85
33915,ELAINE," Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.",85
33916,JERRY, I bought him some kishka.,85
33917,KRAMER, What's that?,85
33918,JERRY," It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.",85
33919,GEORGE, I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.,85
33920,GEORGE," You see? We were made for each other.  It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.",85
33921,GEORGE, Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?,85
33922,GEORGE," Oh, very refreshing.  Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.",85
33923,GEORGE," Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.",85
33924,GEORGE, My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.,85
33925,KRAMER, Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.,85
33926,JERRY," Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?",85
33927,KRAMER," Come on, I'll rub some on yours.",85
33928,JERRY," No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.",85
33929,GEORGE,"  You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.",85
33930,GEORGE," Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?",85
33931,GEORGE," 'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?",85
33932,JERRY, No thanks.,85
33933,KRAMER, No. ,85
33934,JERRY, And then there's Maude. ,85
33935,ELAINE," Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?",85
33936,JERRY, No lines.,85
33937,ELAINE, You know why? One word,85
33938,JERRY, So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?,85
33939,ELAINE, I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.,85
33940,KRAMER," I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?",85
33941,ELAINE,  No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.,85
33942,JERRY,  Oh this is interesting.,85
33943,ELAINE, What?,85
33944,JERRY, Jane's topless. ,85
33945,KRAMER, Yo yo ma.,85
33946,JERRY, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.,85
33947,ELAINE, Nice rack. ,85
33948,JERRY," Oh, in a minute, Carol.",85
33949,KRAMER, We're gonna be right there.,85
33950,JERRY, This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.,85
33951,ELAINE, Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?,85
33952,KRAMER, Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.,85
33953,ELAINE, What?,85
33954,KRAMER," You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.",85
33955,JERRY," Oh, here she comes. ",85
33956,JERRY, No thanks.,85
33957,ELAINE, I'm good.,85
33958,KRAMER," Deh-deh-deh-deh-  All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach.",85
33959,ELAINE," Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby.",85
33960,ELAINE, Ugghh.,85
33961,ELAINE," Oh, gorgeous, yes.",85
33962,JERRY, So very gorgeous.,85
33963,JERRY, Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?,85
33964,ELAINE," Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.",85
33965,JERRY," Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool.  And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.",85
33966,ELAINE," Oh, you have to lie.",85
33967,JERRY, It's a must lie situation.,85
33968,ELAINE," Yes, it's a must lie situation.",85
33969,JERRY," You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.",85
33970,ELAINE," No, I don't think so.",85
33971,JERRY, In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.,85
33972,KRAMER," Oooh, lobsters.",85
33973,ELAINE, Hi.,85
33974,ELAINE,  Pretty gorgeous.,85
33975,ELAINE," Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.",85
33976,ELAINE, Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?,85
33977,JERRY," Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.",85
33978,ELAINE," Yeah, see ya.",85
33979,JERRY, Okay. ,85
33980,JERRY, Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. ,85
33981,GEORGE, Hey Rachel!,85
33982,GEORGE, What kind of a greeting was that?,85
33983,JERRY, She's got greeting problems.,85
33984,GEORGE," Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.",85
33985,JERRY," Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. ",85
33986,KRAMER," Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!",85
33987,GEORGE," Hey! Wow, the K-Man! ",85
33988,JERRY, You got lobster for everybody?,85
33989,KRAMER," Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.",85
33990,GEORGE," This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...",85
33991,KRAMER," I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. ",85
33992,GEORGE," You saw who, what?",85
33993,KRAMER," Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.",85
33994,JERRY,  All right.,85
33995,GEORGE, You saw Jane topless?,85
33996,JERRY," Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.",85
33997,GEORGE, Oh you mean face down on her chest.,85
33998,JERRY, No.,85
33999,GEORGE, Face up on her back?,85
34000,JERRY, Yeah.,85
34001,GEORGE, Well why'd she do that?,85
34002,KRAMER, I guess she was hot.,85
34003,GEORGE, You mean she just laid there topless?,85
34004,KRAMER," No, no, she got up, she walked around...",85
34005,GEORGE, Walked around? And you looked?,85
34006,KRAMER," Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.",85
34007,GEORGE, I can't believe that you saw her before me.,85
34008,JERRY, Think of me as a doctor. ,85
34009,GEORGE," Well, how good a look did you get?",85
34010,JERRY, Well what'd you mean?,85
34011,GEORGE," Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...",85
34012,JERRY, They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.,85
34013,GEORGE," Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.",85
34014,JERRY,  I guess that's true...,85
34015,GEORGE," Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.",85
34016,JERRY, What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?,85
34017,GEORGE," Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.",85
34018,JERRY, You can see me naked. I can offer you that.,85
34019,GEORGE, It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.,85
34020,ELAINE, Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.,85
34021,JERRY, I've never been called breathtaking either.,85
34022,ELAINE," I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?",85
34023,JERRY, Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.,85
34024,ELAINE," Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.",85
34025,JERRY, How are you gonna do that?,85
34026,ELAINE, I can be very clever.,85
34027,ELAINE," Oh, me too. I'll meet you down.  Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.",85
34028,GEORGE," Oh, okay. ",85
34029,GEORGE," Oh, sorry.",85
34030,GEORGE," I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.",85
34031,JERRY, You might have.,85
34032,GEORGE, I didn't.,85
34033,JERRY, You won't.,85
34034,JERRY," Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?",85
34035,GEORGE," No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.",85
34036,JERRY," Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.",85
34037,GEORGE," Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.",85
34038,GEORGE, Okay.  Thanks anyway. ,85
34039,JERRY, Wait'll you get to know him.,85
34040,JERRY," Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. ",85
34041,GEORGE,  I was in the pool! I was in the pool!,85
34042,GEORGE, Did she do it on purpose?,85
34043,JERRY," It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.",85
34044,GEORGE, I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.,85
34045,JERRY, So what?,85
34046,GEORGE, Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...,85
34047,JERRY, But...,85
34048,GEORGE, Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...,85
34049,JERRY, Oh... You mean... shrinkage.,85
34050,GEORGE, Yes. Significant shrinkage.,85
34051,JERRY, So you feel you were short changed.,85
34052,GEORGE," Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.",85
34053,JERRY," Well, so what's the difference?",85
34054,GEORGE, What if she discusses it with Jane?,85
34055,JERRY," Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.",85
34056,GEORGE, How do you know?,85
34057,JERRY, Women aren't like us.,85
34058,GEORGE," They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?",85
34059,JERRY," No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.",85
34060,GEORGE, How do women know about shrinkage?,85
34061,JERRY, Isn't it common knowledge?,85
34062,GEORGE, Do women know about shrinkage?,85
34063,ELAINE," What do you mean, like laundry?",85
34064,GEORGE, No.,85
34065,JERRY, Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...,85
34066,ELAINE, It shrinks?,85
34067,JERRY, Like a frightened turtle!,85
34068,ELAINE, Why does it shrink?,85
34069,GEORGE, It just does.,85
34070,ELAINE, I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.,85
34071,KRAMER," Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?",85
34072,KRAMER, You mean you've never tasted lobster?,85
34073,KRAMER," Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.",85
34074,JERRY," No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.",85
34075,ELAINE," Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.",85
34076,JERRY," Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.",85
34077,GEORGE," See, look at this.  Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.",85
34078,ELAINE," Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. ",85
34079,GEORGE," What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?",85
34080,GEORGE," You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?",85
34081,JERRY,  Easy big fella.,85
34082,KRAMER," No, I got 'em in the ocean.",85
34083,KRAMER," Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.",85
34084,KRAMER, Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.,85
34085,KRAMER, Ahhh! ,85
34086,ELAINE," Some night, huh?",85
34087,ELAINE," Some dinner, huh?",85
34088,ELAINE," Some house, huh?",85
34089,ELAINE," Some ugly baby, huh?",85
34090,ELAINE,"  I said, uh, some snuggly baby.",85
34091,ELAINE," Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.",85
34092,JERRY, You told her?,85
34093,JERRY," You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.",85
34094,GEORGE, You're going back to New York now?,85
34095,GEORGE," Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.",85
34096,GEORGE, And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?,85
34097,GEORGE," *I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!",85
34098,GEORGE," Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage.",85
34099,KRAMER, You looking for this? ,85
34100,KRAMER," Well, I thought you might wind up around here.",85
34101,KRAMER, No I'm afraid I couldn't do that.,85
34102,KRAMER," Well, that wouldn't be kosher.",85
34103,KRAMER," Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.",85
34104,KRAMER, Heyahhh!,85
34105,JERRY," Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. ",85
34106,ELAINE," George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.",85
34107,KRAMER, Ya I didn't know you could cook.,85
34108,GEORGE," Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.",85
34109,KRAMER, Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.,85
34110,JERRY,"  Hey, look at this guy.",85
34111,GEORGE, A little breakfast.,85
34112,JERRY, Yeah.,85
34113,GEORGE,"  And, uh, you eat eggs, right?",85
34114,JERRY," Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?",85
34115,GEORGE," Ah, enjoying them?",85
34116,GEORGE," Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. ",85
34117,GEORGE," Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.",85
34118,JERRY," Well, I guess I gotta go, too.",85
34119,ELAINE," Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. ",85
34120,KRAMER, Wonder what's goin' on.,85
34121,GEORGE," Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.",85
34122,GEORGE, I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.,85
34123,ELAINE," Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.",85
34124,JERRY, I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.,85
34125,ELAINE, How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?,85
34126,JERRY, They got some sort of program.,85
34127,GEORGE," Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.",85
34128,JERRY," Hey, isn't that Michael's car?",85
34129,ELAINE, There's Rachel.,85
34130,GEORGE, Where? ,85
34131,ELAINE," Oh, thank you!  Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.",86
34132,ELAINE, You really oughtta do something about that cold.,86
34133,JERRY, You got a raise?,86
34134,ELAINE," I don't fool around,  baby!",86
34135,JERRY, I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.,86
34136,ELAINE," They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.",86
34137,JERRY," Oh, when did that happen?",86
34138,ELAINE, They're signing the papers next week.,86
34139,JERRY, Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?,86
34140,ELAINE," Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.",86
34141,JERRY," Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.",86
34142,ELAINE," Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.",86
34143,JERRY," Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen ""Girlie"" Brown would be very proud of you.",86
34144,JERRY, Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?,86
34145,GEORGE, I went to the beach. ,86
34146,JERRY," Oh, the beach.",86
34147,GEORGE," It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. ",86
34148,JERRY, What is it that isn't working?,86
34149,GEORGE," Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright.  Oh, maybe not academically speaking,  I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.",86
34150,JERRY,  Could I get napkin over there?,86
34151,GEORGE," It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong.  Everywhere.",86
34152,GEORGE," Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. ",86
34153,ELAINE," Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.",86
34154,JERRY," You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current,  and the tuna swim with it. ",86
34155,GEORGE,  Good for the tuna.,86
34156,ELAINE," Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.",86
34157,GEORGE, So what? What am I supposed to do?,86
34158,ELAINE, Go talk to her.,86
34159,GEORGE," Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.",86
34160,JERRY," Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.",86
34161,GEORGE," Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.",86
34162,JERRY," If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.",86
34163,GEORGE," Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!",86
34164,GEORGE," Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.",86
34165,GEORGE, My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.,86
34166,JERRY,"  Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. ",86
34167,KRAMER," Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!",86
34168,JERRY, What's happening?,86
34169,KRAMER, The coffee table book. It's a go-oo!,86
34170,JERRY," Oh yeah, I heard all about it.",86
34171,KRAMER, You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop ,86
34172,JERRY, You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?,86
34173,KRAMER," Oh, you better believe it!",86
34174,JERRY, I'll loan you my puffy shirt.,86
34175,KRAMER," No, no, no.",86
34176,JERRY, What're you gonna talk about?,86
34177,KRAMER," Well, coffee tables.",86
34178,JERRY," Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye.  You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.",86
34179,KRAMER, You know who you are? Even Steven,86
34180,GEORGE, Why shave every day? It just grows right back.,86
34181,GEORGE," I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.",86
34182,GEORGE, Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.,86
34183,GEORGE, That won't be necessary.,86
34184,GEORGE," Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!",86
34185,GEORGE, I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.,86
34186,GEORGE, I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.,86
34187,ELAINE, Yes.,86
34188,ELAINE, Yeah.,86
34189,ELAINE,  An accident? What happened?,86
34190,ELAINE, Oh. Ok. Thank you.,86
34191,ELAINE, Could I have a box of Jujyfruits?,86
34192,ELAINE,"  Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.",86
34193,ELAINE, You want one?,86
34194,ELAINE, So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?,86
34195,ELAINE, At the movies.,86
34196,ELAINE," Yeah, he did.",86
34197,ELAINE, Right after ... that ...,86
34198,ELAINE," Well... the counter...was right there, and...",86
34199,ELAINE," No, no, it does!",86
34200,ELAINE, But...Jake...,86
34201,ELAINE," But, Jake, I didn't...",86
34202,JERRY,  Broke even.,86
34203,KRAMER," Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.",86
34204,KRAMER," Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!",86
34205,KRAMER," You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.",86
34206,KRAMER, That's true. That's right.,86
34207,KRAMER," Oh, it's on file, right here. ",86
34208,JERRY, So it's all over?,86
34209,ELAINE," Yeah, it got pretty nasty.",86
34210,JERRY, And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?,86
34211,ELAINE, It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.,86
34212,JERRY, Why didn't you eat it in the cab?,86
34213,ELAINE," Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.",86
34214,ELAINE, What's all this?,86
34215,JERRY, Played cards last night.,86
34216,ELAINE, Oh yeah? How'd you do?,86
34217,JERRY, Broke even.,86
34218,ELAINE, You always break even.,86
34219,JERRY," Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!",86
34220,ELAINE, Do you have twenty bucks?,86
34221,JERRY, What for?,86
34222,ELAINE, Just gimme twenty bucks.,86
34223,JERRY,  What the hell was that?,86
34224,ELAINE, Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.,86
34225,JERRY, You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.,86
34226,ELAINE," You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -",86
34227,JERRY," Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.",86
34228,GEORGE," Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -",86
34229,JERRY, Bad.,86
34230,GEORGE, Day was -,86
34231,ELAINE, Night.,86
34232,GEORGE, Yes!,86
34233,JERRY, So you just did the opposite of everything?,86
34234,GEORGE," Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.",86
34235,JERRY, So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.,86
34236,GEORGE, Yes funny  let's go.,86
34237,JERRY, Elaine ... look! A twenty!,86
34238,ELAINE,  Oh my God.,86
34239,KRAMER, Hey boss.,86
34240,KRAMER," How're you doin' there, big guy? ",86
34241,KRAMER, Al-righty  Have you got yourself a cold?,86
34242,KRAMER," Woah, that's quite a honk!",86
34243,KRAMER, Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.,86
34244,KRAMER," Ya that was pretty good, huh?",86
34245,KRAMER, Because of the coffee thing?,86
34246,KRAMER," What about ""Sonia Live""? Now you're not cancelling ""Sonia Live""?",86
34247,KRAMER," She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.",86
34248,GEORGE, Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.,86
34249,GEORGE," Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.",86
34250,GEORGE, Of course.,86
34251,GEORGE," I am different, yeah.",86
34252,GEORGE," Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!",86
34253,ELAINE," Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.",86
34254,ELAINE, Hi Tina.,86
34255,ELAINE," So, I haven't seen you in a while.",86
34256,ELAINE," Well, what is it?",86
34257,ELAINE, Kicked out?! Why?!,86
34258,ELAINE, Yeah? Like what?,86
34259,ELAINE," Ah, I didn't know who he was!",86
34260,ELAINE, What else?,86
34261,ELAINE, What else have you got?,86
34262,JERRY," I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.",86
34263,JERRY," Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.",86
34264,JERRY, Yes?,86
34265,JERRY, Uh huh?,86
34266,JERRY," Oh, that's okay.",86
34267,JERRY," Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.",86
34268,JERRY," Sure. See, things always even out for me.",86
34269,JERRY," It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!",86
34270,JERRY,  She'll be coming around the mountain...,86
34271,JERRY, The New York Yankees?!,86
34272,GEORGE, The New York Yankees!,86
34273,JERRY," Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?",86
34274,GEORGE," I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!",86
34275,JERRY, I can't believe it.,86
34276,GEORGE, Ya!,86
34277,JERRY, Ya?,86
34278,ELAINE,  It's me.,86
34279,JERRY,  Come on up.,86
34280,GEORGE," And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?",86
34281,JERRY, That's a great place!,86
34282,GEORGE," I'm back in business, baby!",86
34283,JERRY," George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.",86
34284,GEORGE, Hey! ,86
34285,JERRY, Hi Elaine.,86
34286,ELAINE, Hi.,86
34287,JERRY, How're things going?,86
34288,ELAINE, How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!,86
34289,JERRY, Why? Why are they doing that?,86
34290,ELAINE, I don't know! They have a list of grievances.,86
34291,JERRY, The jewel thief?,86
34292,ELAINE," Yeah, the jewel thief.",86
34293,JERRY, What else?,86
34294,ELAINE, I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine.  I gotta be out by the end of the month.,86
34295,GEORGE," Well, you could move in with my parents. ",86
34296,ELAINE," Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? ",86
34297,GEORGE, Instinct.,86
34298,ELAINE, Stick ... with the opposite. ,86
34299,JERRY," Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up,  he was down. Now he's up,  you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?",86
34300,ELAINE,"  Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.",86
34301,JERRY, Is that the end of it?,86
34302,GEORGE," Yeah, it's the last one.",86
34303,JERRY, Alright.,86
34304,KRAMER," Oh, it's true.",86
34305,GEORGE," Alright, let's go.",86
34306,GEORGE, I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.,86
34307,JERRY, He knows what he's doing.,86
34308,GEORGE," I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.",86
34309,JERRY, Opposite.,86
34310,ELAINE, I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!,86
34311,JERRY, Why'd you have to eat so many?,86
34312,ELAINE, Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.,86
34313,JERRY, Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.,86
34314,KRAMER," Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!",86
34315,ELAINE, Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.,86
34316,JERRY, Don't say that.,86
34317,ELAINE, It's true. I'm George! I'm George!,86
34318,GEORGE," Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two!  Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'.  So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly -  he's the first base man.",86
34319,ELAINE, Uh huh.,86
34320,GEORGE," We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.",86
34321,KRAMER," Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.",86
34322,JERRY, Ah ... let's call it even.,86
34323,JERRY,"Baseball is so associated with sex. ""He's playing the field,"" ""Hoo, he scored,"" ""oh, he didn't get to first base."" ""I struck out."" ""Why?"" ""She wanted a diamond."" It's always about baseball. Always baseball. As far as baseball goes, I prefer the fat umpires...I feel if you're on the field and you're not in the game, you should be in the worst physical condition a human being could possibly be in. They should be allowed to eat during the game. We're a little too into sports in this country, I think we gotta throttle back. Know what I mean? People come home from these games, ""We won! We won!"" No, they won - you watched.",87
34324,GEORGE," O.K., Danny, take a swing.  N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.",87
34325,GEORGE," No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!",87
34326,GEORGE, What are all sweatin' for?,87
34327,GEORGE, Hot?  What is this?,87
34328,GEORGE," This uniform, what's it made from?",87
34329,GEORGE," No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see.  Will you stop it?  Oh. Of course. Polyester!",87
34330,GEORGE, I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.,87
34331,GEORGE, You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?,87
34332,GEORGE," Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.",87
34333,GEORGE," Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. ",87
34334,ELAINE," Oh, you want one?",87
34335,JERRY, Yeah.,87
34336,ELAINE, I'll get it. ,87
34337,JERRY," That's alright, I got it.",87
34338,ELAINE, Jerry!,87
34339,JERRY," Elaine, stop it.",87
34340,ELAINE," Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money.  Yo! Dogs! Two!",87
34341,JERRY, I'm sorry.,87
34342,ELAINE," Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.",87
34343,JERRY," Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?",87
34344,ELAINE," Yeah, she was an editor.",87
34345,JERRY," Right, just like you.",87
34346,ELAINE, Yeah. Can you hold my seat? ,87
34347,JERRY," Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...",87
34348,JERRY, I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. ,87
34349,GEORGE, Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?,87
34350,JERRY," Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.",87
34351,GEORGE, You're incredible.,87
34352,JERRY," And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.",87
34353,GEORGE," What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!",87
34354,JERRY," The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.",87
34355,GEORGE," Chaperone? What, are you kidding?",87
34356,JERRY," No, it's part of the contest rules.",87
34357,GEORGE, What does the chaperone do?,87
34358,JERRY," I don't know, she just sits there.",87
34359,GEORGE, Can she talk?,87
34360,JERRY, I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. ,87
34361,GEORGE, You're calling her?,87
34362,JERRY," Yeah.  There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?",87
34363,GEORGE," Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?",87
34364,JERRY," Of course, they're polyester.",87
34365,GEORGE," Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.",87
34366,JERRY, Why do they wear polyester?,87
34367,GEORGE, I don't know. That's all gonna change.,87
34368,JERRY, You're going to do something about it?,87
34369,GEORGE, Why shouldn't I?,87
34370,ELAINE," Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -",87
34371,ELAINE," O.K., fine, I have...no grace.",87
34372,ELAINE," Well, I have no intention of ""getting"" grace.",87
34373,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, right.",87
34374,ELAINE, Justin Pitt?,87
34375,ELAINE," ""Mrs. Onassis's""? That's hard to pronounce.",87
34376,ELAINE, Nothing. ,87
34377,ELAINE, I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...,87
34378,JERRY," Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that ""Miss Congeniality"" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone.  The chaperone can't make it.  Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going?  Hold on one second.  Hey, what are you doing tonight?",87
34379,KRAMER, Nothin.',87
34380,JERRY," I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?",87
34381,KRAMER, What state?,87
34382,JERRY, Rhode Island.,87
34383,KRAMER, They're never in contention.,87
34384,GEORGE, How do you know?,87
34385,KRAMER, Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.,87
34386,JERRY," Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.",87
34387,KRAMER, Giddy-up!,87
34388,ELAINE," Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.",87
34389,ELAINE, Grace?,87
34390,ELAINE, You think Ihave grace?,87
34391,ELAINE, Just some?,87
34392,GEORGE," Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?",87
34393,GEORGE, How's everything going? Everything O.K.?,87
34394,GEORGE," Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.",87
34395,GEORGE," Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.",87
34396,GEORGE," Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.",87
34397,GEORGE, Oh - I've got something.,87
34398,JERRY, Congratulations!,87
34399,ELAINE," Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.",87
34400,JERRY," Now, what is it that you do, exactly?",87
34401,ELAINE, I attend to his personal affairs.,87
34402,JERRY, Like what?,87
34403,ELAINE," Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.",87
34404,JERRY, Really! Socks!,87
34405,ELAINE, Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.,87
34406,JERRY," Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! ",87
34407,JERRY," Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just ""recede into the night,"" if you know what I mean.",87
34408,KRAMER, No way!,87
34409,JERRY, What?,87
34410,KRAMER," Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.",87
34411,JERRY," I'm not going to ""defile"" her!",87
34412,KRAMER," That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.",87
34413,JERRY, But -,87
34414,JERRY, But wait a minute...,87
34415,KRAMER," Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! ",87
34416,KRAMER," If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?",87
34417,JERRY, That's a hell of a plan.  Listen -,87
34418,JERRY," Alright, Kramer!",87
34419,KRAMER," This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.",87
34420,KRAMER," Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.",87
34421,KRAMER, Tape her breasts together. ,87
34422,KRAMER," Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.",87
34423,JERRY," Hey, come on!",87
34424,KRAMER," Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.",87
34425,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.",87
34426,JERRY, I'll be right back. ,87
34427,KRAMER," So, what's your talent?",87
34428,KRAMER, Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.,87
34429,KRAMER," No, five. But you were close.",87
34430,KRAMER, How's your evening?,87
34431,KRAMER, Stop right there.,87
34432,KRAMER, Disaster.,87
34433,KRAMER," Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.",87
34434,JERRY," Well, here we are...",87
34435,KRAMER," Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.",87
34436,KRAMER, Hey.,87
34437,JERRY," Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.",87
34438,KRAMER," Oh, come on.",87
34439,JERRY," And that waist cincher, that was the topper!",87
34440,KRAMER," Oh, you're poo-pooing!",87
34441,JERRY," Yes, I poo-poo.",87
34442,KRAMER," Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!",87
34443,JERRY, I don't want to stop her!,87
34444,KRAMER," You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! ",87
34445,JERRY," Yeah, so do you. ",87
34446,GEORGE," Well, did you see it?",87
34447,JERRY, See what?,87
34448,GEORGE," The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments!  ""Wade Boggs",87
34449,JERRY," Boy, they really do sound comfortable.",87
34450,JERRY, I'm working in Atlantic City.,87
34451,GEORGE, Really!,87
34452,JERRY," Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?",87
34453,GEORGE, Atlantic City?  Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.,87
34454,JERRY," You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her.  She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...",87
34455,ELAINE," So, what do you think?",87
34456,ELAINE, You don't like them?,87
34457,ELAINE, What's wrong?,87
34458,ELAINE, Too tight?,87
34459,ELAINE," Alright, well, I'll just take them back. ",87
34460,JERRY," Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?",87
34461,ELAINE, Sorry. Hello?,87
34462,JERRY," Hey Elaine, it's me.",87
34463,ELAINE, Jerry?,87
34464,JERRY, We're going to Atlantic City.,87
34465,ELAINE, Really? When?,87
34466,JERRY," Today, right now! Are you in?",87
34467,ELAINE," One second, hang on.  Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?",87
34468,ELAINE, Yes.,87
34469,ELAINE," Well, it's just one more day.",87
34470,JERRY, Why not?,87
34471,ELAINE, Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.,87
34472,ELAINE, I gotta go. ,87
34473,KRAMER," No. Alright, watch me now.  Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.",87
34474,KRAMER," Let's try a few more questions, alright?  If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?",87
34475,KRAMER," Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!",87
34476,GEORGE, Hey.,87
34477,JERRY, Hey.,87
34478,GEORGE, How was the show?,87
34479,JERRY, Good. How was the roulette?,87
34480,GEORGE," I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.",87
34481,JERRY," Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!",87
34482,ELAINE, But what??,87
34483,ELAINE, But that's why I got you the tighter ones! ,87
34484,ELAINE, What do you want!?,87
34485,JERRY, What the hell is that?,87
34486,GEORGE," I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!",87
34487,GEORGE, Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?,87
34488,JERRY," Wait a second.  This'll scare 'em off.  Well, good night, Ollie.",87
34489,GEORGE," Good night, Stan.",87
34490,KRAMER, What is it?,87
34491,KRAMER, How did this happen?,87
34492,KRAMER, Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.,87
34493,KRAMER," Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!",87
34494,JERRY, What? Why? What happened?,87
34495,KRAMER, Her birds are dead.,87
34496,JERRY, Birds?,87
34497,KRAMER," Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! ",87
34498,JERRY," What are you looking at?  Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.",87
34499,JERRY," No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!",87
34500,KRAMER," Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!",87
34501,JERRY," Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! ",87
34502,JERRY," Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.",87
34503,GEORGE, Oh. ,87
34504,KRAMER, How ya feelin'?,87
34505,KRAMER, There's nothing to be nervous about.,87
34506,JERRY, I heard those doves were really incredible.,87
34507,GEORGE, That's a shame. ,87
34508,JERRY, It's like watching an animal get tortured.,87
34509,GEORGE," Hey, hey! Yankee game! ",87
34510,JERRY," Oh, great! Alright. ",87
34511,JERRY, That's a shame.,87
34512,KRAMER, Poise. Poise!,87
34513,JERRY,Its fascinating. When you go into a stationery store that they’re manufacturing millions of pens; constantly we’re all buying them. I must have bought six thousand Bics in my life. I’ve used up maybe two of them. Where are the rest of them? When you move the refrigerator there’s a couple back there but it doesn’t account for it. Where are all the pens? That’s why it’s so embarrassing if you don’t have one. You got a pen? Can I borrow a pen? We always have to whisper because it’s so humiliating. I don’t have a pen. They’re making millions of them every week!   I know; where are they?,88
34514,ELAINE," Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.",88
34515,ELAINE," No, I'm sure you do.",88
34516,ELAINE," Well, it's for my boss.",88
34517,ELAINE, Elaine.,88
34518,ELAINE," It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha",88
34519,ELAINE," Uh, aw, KL5-239O.",88
34520,ELAINE," Okay,   Move  along. . .",88
34521,JERRY, Why did you give him MY number?,88
34522,ELAINE, I think he's got ideas.,88
34523,JERRY, I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?,88
34524,JERRY, Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?,88
34525,ELAINE," Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?",88
34526,JERRY, Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.,88
34527,GEORGE," Hey, hey.",88
34528,ELAINE, Hey hey,88
34529,JERRY, Hi Julie.,88
34530,GEORGE," Elaine, Julie.",88
34531,ELAINE, Hi.,88
34532,ELAINE," Oh, mine's ""Ike"".",88
34533,GEORGE," Hey, wanna get some lunch?",88
34534,JERRY, Just had a big bowl of Kix.,88
34535,GEORGE," Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?",88
34536,ELAINE," Ah, no.",88
34537,ELAINE," No, no. How about if you bring me back something?",88
34538,GEORGE," Sure, all right, what do you want?",88
34539,ELAINE," Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?",88
34540,GEORGE, What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.,88
34541,ELAINE, They have big salads.,88
34542,GEORGE, I've never seen a big salad.,88
34543,ELAINE, They have a big salad.,88
34544,GEORGE, Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?,88
34545,ELAINE," It's okay, you don't…",88
34546,GEORGE," No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?",88
34547,JERRY," Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.",88
34548,GEORGE," , we'll see you in a little while.",88
34549,ELAINE, Maybe I should just get married.,88
34550,JERRY, Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?,88
34551,ELAINE," I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.",88
34552,JERRY, People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.,88
34553,ELAINE, You can say that again.,88
34554,JERRY," It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.",88
34555,ELAINE, Good for you.,88
34556,JERRY, I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.,88
34557,ELAINE, Right on baby. ,88
34558,JERRY, What was that?,88
34559,KRAMER," That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.",88
34560,ELAINE, Who Gendason?,88
34561,KRAMER, Steve Gendason.,88
34562,ELAINE, Why is that name familiar?,88
34563,ELAINE," Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?",88
34564,KRAMER," Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.",88
34565,ELAINE, So what?,88
34566,KRAMER," Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.",88
34567,JERRY, Certainly are.,88
34568,KRAMER," Ya, so I penalized him a stroke.",88
34569,KRAMER, He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .,88
34570,JERRY, All right. You're in MY face.,88
34571,ELAINE, I still don't see what the big deal is.,88
34572,KRAMER, A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.,88
34573,GEORGE," Oh, Safire. Uh ha",88
34574,GEORGE, He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.,88
34575,GEORGE," Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No ""r"" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. ""Hebert"" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right.  All right. I",88
34576,GEORGE," No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.",88
34577,JERRY,"  Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.",88
34578,ELAINE, I told ya'. He has ideas.,88
34579,JERRY, He doesn't even care if a man answers.,88
34580,ELAINE, Or you.,88
34581,GEORGE," Hey, hey.",88
34582,ELAINE, Hey.,88
34583,ELAINE, No problem.,88
34584,ELAINE," Thank you, Julie.",88
34585,GEORGE," No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.",88
34586,GEORGE," Ya, you go.",88
34587,JERRY, Bye bye,88
34588,GEORGE, Did you see what just happened?,88
34589,JERRY," Well, that all depends. . .",88
34590,GEORGE, Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?,88
34591,JERRY," Yeah, so?",88
34592,GEORGE," Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.",88
34593,JERRY, Is that a fact?,88
34594,GEORGE, Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.,88
34595,JERRY, No it isn't.,88
34596,GEORGE, I mean I'm the one who bought it.,88
34597,JERRY, Yes you did.,88
34598,GEORGE, You think she should have said something?,88
34599,JERRY, She could have.,88
34600,GEORGE," Oh, I know.",88
34601,JERRY," Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.",88
34602,GEORGE, You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.,88
34603,JERRY, Obviously.,88
34604,KRAMER, Turn on the TV.,88
34605,JERRY, What?,88
34606,KRAMER, I'm puttin it on…,88
34607,KRAMER, Jerry . . .,88
34608,JERRY," Well, it has nothing to do with you.",88
34609,KRAMER," Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.",88
34610,JERRY," Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.",88
34611,ELAINE, I like Julie. She's very personable.,88
34612,GEORGE," Yeah, she's very lovely.",88
34613,ELAINE, That's great George.,88
34614,GEORGE, So did you enjoy your lunch?,88
34615,ELAINE," Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?",88
34616,GEORGE," oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .",88
34617,ELAINE, Even though what?,88
34618,GEORGE," . . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?",88
34619,ELAINE," What? What are you trying to say, George?",88
34620,GEORGE, It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.,88
34621,ELAINE," You want the money for the big salad, George?",88
34622,GEORGE," No, no,",88
34623,ELAINE, What is the problem?,88
34624,GEORGE, There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.,88
34625,JERRY, And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.,88
34626,JERRY," Ah, no , I don't think so.",88
34627,JERRY, We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.,88
34628,JERRY," Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.",88
34629,JERRY, Hello Newman.,88
34630,JERRY," No, no I don't. Why?",88
34631,JERRY, I suppose.,88
34632,JERRY, I don't know. Nothing.?,88
34633,JERRY, You two know each other?,88
34634,JERRY, . . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?,88
34635,JERRY, Why?,88
34636,JERRY," You liked, Newman?",88
34637,JERRY," No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.",88
34638,JERRY, . . . HE ended it?,88
34639,JERRY," No, no of course not.",88
34640,KRAMER," Jerry, Jerry they found a tee.",88
34641,JERRY, What tee?,88
34642,KRAMER, A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.,88
34643,JERRY, Newman! She went out with Newman!,88
34644,ELAINE, It must be a mistake.,88
34645,JERRY," No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?",88
34646,ELAINE, Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.,88
34647,JERRY," No, there's less.",88
34648,ELAINE, It's possible.,88
34649,JERRY, No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.,88
34650,ELAINE," He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.",88
34651,JERRY," Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.",88
34652,JERRY," No,, but thank you.",88
34653,JERRY," Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.",88
34654,ELAINE, Ugh! You are kidding me.,88
34655,JERRY," No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.",88
34656,ELAINE, I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.,88
34657,JERRY," Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.",88
34658,ELAINE, To please Mr. Pitt.,88
34659,JERRY," Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.",88
34660,ELAINE," Uh, great!",88
34661,JERRY, Hi Julie.,88
34662,JERRY, Hi.,88
34663,ELAINE, Hi Julie.,88
34664,JERRY," Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.",88
34665,ELAINE," Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.",88
34666,JERRY, How do you know THAT?,88
34667,JERRY, It's Jerry.,88
34668,JERRY, Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!,88
34669,JERRY," Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?",88
34670,JERRY," No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?",88
34671,JERRY, Noit your type?,88
34672,JERRY," Well, how come?",88
34673,JERRY," What, what is wrong with her?",88
34674,JERRY, You don't think she's attractive?,88
34675,JERRY," Okay, Newman, thanks a lot.",88
34676,JERRY," No, thank you.",88
34677,KRAMER," Listen to this, ""If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. "" That's a rule, Jerry.",88
34678,JERRY, But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?,88
34679,KRAMER," Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.",88
34680,JERRY, What are you so worried about this for?,88
34681,KRAMER, You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?,88
34682,JERRY, He did?,88
34683,KRAMER," Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.",88
34684,JERRY, So it had nothing to do with you.,88
34685,KRAMER," Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.",88
34686,JERRY," No, I don't think so.",88
34687,KRAMER," Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus.",88
34688,JERRY," Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.",88
34689,JERRY," Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?",88
34690,KRAMER," Oh, I love curls.",88
34691,JERRY," Yeah,, me too.",88
34692,KRAMER," All right, I'll see you later.",88
34693,JERRY, Where you going?,88
34694,KRAMER, Genderson's.,88
34695,JERRY, You're going to see Genderson?,88
34696,KRAMER, It's weighing on my conscience.,88
34697,GEORGE," You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?",88
34698,GEORGE, A ha! We're just friends.,88
34699,GEORGE," Oh, share.",88
34700,GEORGE," Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.",88
34701,GEORGE," Well, she probably just assumed.",88
34702,GEORGE," . . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?",88
34703,GEORGE," . . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?",88
34704,ELAINE, It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.,88
34705,ELAINE," No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.",88
34706,ELAINE, Really? A fight with the foreman?,88
34707,ELAINE," Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.",88
34708,ELAINE, Okay.,88
34709,JERRY, You had how many dates with him? Three?,88
34710,JERRY, And . .,88
34711,JERRY, What? I'm not looking. Nothing.,88
34712,JERRY, Why are you looking at my face?,88
34713,JERRY, Where am I going to look?,88
34714,JERRY, . . . I can't.,88
34715,JERRY, Newman!,88
34716,JERRY, All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.,88
34717,ELAINE," Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.",88
34718,JERRY, You're going out with the stationery store guy?,88
34719,ELAINE, I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.,88
34720,ELAINE," Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.",88
34721,ELAINE," Uh, uh.",88
34722,GEORGE," You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.",88
34723,JERRY," Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here.  Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.",88
34724,KRAMER," Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.",88
34725,KRAMER, My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!,88
34726,KRAMER, I thought we would blend in.,88
34727,KRAMER, we would have had all that bridge traffic.,88
34728,ELAINE, She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?,89
34729,JERRY," Your friend, Noreen.",89
34730,ELAINE, Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?,89
34731,JERRY," If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.",89
34732,ELAINE, I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.,89
34733,JERRY," If you don't believe me, ask her.",89
34734,ELAINE," I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?",89
34735,JERRY," Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.",89
34736,ELAINE, Yeah.,89
34737,KRAMER," Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?",89
34738,JERRY, Check the pile.,89
34739,KRAMER,"  Oh, who sent you a card?",89
34740,JERRY, I don't know.,89
34741,KRAMER," Open it, it's from Hallmark.",89
34742,JERRY, Oh.,89
34743,ELAINE," Hello, darling.",89
34744,JERRY," Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.",89
34745,KRAMER, Let me see.,89
34746,ELAINE, Who's Kristin?,89
34747,JERRY," She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.",89
34748,KRAMER, Did you ask her about me?,89
34749,JERRY," Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.",89
34750,KRAMER," Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?",89
34751,JERRY," No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.",89
34752,KRAMER," Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?",89
34753,JERRY," Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.",89
34754,ELAINE,  You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.,89
34755,JERRY," Oh, go ahead.",89
34756,ELAINE, You sure you don't mind?,89
34757,JERRY, Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.,89
34758,ELAINE," Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.",89
34759,ELAINE, Jerry Seinfeld.,89
34760,ELAINE, You mean like like?,89
34761,ELAINE," Noreen, were you hitting on him?",89
34762,ELAINE, Ooh.,89
34763,ELAINE, Uh oh.,89
34764,JERRY," So was I right? She likes me, right?",89
34765,ELAINE," Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello?",89
34766,ELAINE, Is this Noreen?,89
34767,ELAINE," Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--",89
34768,ELAINE," Noreen, are you crying?",89
34769,ELAINE," Oh, hi Dan.",89
34770,ELAINE, Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.,89
34771,ELAINE," No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.",89
34772,ELAINE," Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was--  You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--",89
34773,JERRY," I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.",89
34774,JERRY," Oh, I know you are.",89
34775,JERRY, I did.,89
34776,JERRY, What?,89
34777,JERRY, No?,89
34778,JERRY, Well--,89
34779,JERRY," You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.",89
34780,JERRY," Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?",89
34781,JERRY," I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.",89
34782,JERRY,"  Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?",89
34783,KRAMER," New cards, huh?",89
34784,JERRY," No, they're old cards from my grandmother.",89
34785,KRAMER," Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.",89
34786,JERRY, Yeah.,89
34787,KRAMER,"  Oh, a check.",89
34788,JERRY," Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.",89
34789,KRAMER, There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?,89
34790,JERRY," I don't know, it's ten dollars.",89
34791,KRAMER, But you got a whole pile here. 1987?,89
34792,JERRY, Oh so what.,89
34793,KRAMER," Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.",89
34794,JERRY," Oh, get out of here.",89
34795,KRAMER," Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.",89
34796,JERRY," Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks.",89
34797,KRAMER, Yeah.,89
34798,JERRY," It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?",89
34799,GEORGE, The rule is a minimum of two days.,89
34800,JERRY, You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?,89
34801,GEORGE, I'm making it up.,89
34802,JERRY," I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.",89
34803,GEORGE," Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.",89
34804,JERRY, Absolutely.,89
34805,GEORGE," If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.",89
34806,JERRY," So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.",89
34807,GEORGE, Let's have it.,89
34808,JERRY," Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...",89
34809,GEORGE, You want me to ask one of the Yankees.,89
34810,JERRY, Could you?,89
34811,GEORGE, Alright. I'll run it by a few people.,89
34812,JERRY," Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.",89
34813,ELAINE,  I should never have made that phone call.,89
34814,JERRY," Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?",89
34815,ELAINE," Yes, she's very upset.",89
34816,JERRY, So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?,89
34817,ELAINE," I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--",89
34818,GEORGE, Who was flirting with you?,89
34819,JERRY," Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?",89
34820,GEORGE, She wasn't flirting with you.,89
34821,JERRY," Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.",89
34822,ELAINE," Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.",89
34823,JERRY," Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?",89
34824,ELAINE," So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.",89
34825,GEORGE, Really?,89
34826,ELAINE, Yeah.,89
34827,JERRY, Why does he do that?,89
34828,GEORGE, He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.,89
34829,JERRY," Oh, you know.",89
34830,GEORGE," What, you think I eat all my meals with you?  Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?",89
34831,GEORGE, Got it.  Did you just see what happened here?,89
34832,ELAINE, What?,89
34833,GEORGE, Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.,89
34834,JERRY, That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.,89
34835,GEORGE," So, what do you think?",89
34836,GEORGE," Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.",89
34837,GEORGE," I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?",89
34838,JERRY," Okay, sixty bucks from Nana.",89
34839,KRAMER, Huh? Yeah.,89
34840,JERRY, You got Danny Tartabull?!,89
34841,GEORGE," You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.",89
34842,JERRY," Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.",89
34843,GEORGE," Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.",89
34844,KRAMER, So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.,89
34845,GEORGE, Absolutely. Pending approval of the script.,89
34846,JERRY, Excuse me?,89
34847,GEORGE," Jerry, I'm Yankee management.",89
34848,KRAMER," Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.",89
34849,JERRY, You're just answering phones!,89
34850,KRAMER, It would put me at ease.,89
34851,GEORGE," Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.",89
34852,JERRY," Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men",89
34853,JERRY, Right you are.,89
34854,GEORGE," I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.",89
34855,GEORGE,"  I don't believe it, she did it again!",89
34856,JERRY," Oh, she had an itch.",89
34857,GEORGE, She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.,89
34858,JERRY," By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.",89
34859,JERRY,  Hello?,89
34860,JERRY, Uncle Leo!,89
34861,JERRY, Nana's missing?,89
34862,JERRY," I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.",89
34863,KRAMER," Yeah, that's right. You did.",89
34864,JERRY, I think Chemical Bank.,89
34865,KRAMER," Oh, they were Chemical.",89
34866,JERRY," Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy.  I never should have cashed those checks!",89
34867,KRAMER," Hey, I didn't twist your arm.",89
34868,JERRY," Just call me if you hear anything.  Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!",89
34869,KRAMER," Well, don't look at me.",89
34870,JERRY, It's your fault!,89
34871,KRAMER, My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.,89
34872,ELAINE," I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.",89
34873,ELAINE," Well, you know, because he's a high talker.",89
34874,ELAINE," No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.",89
34875,ELAINE, You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?,89
34876,ELAINE," Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?",89
34877,ELAINE," Well, he looks like a man.",89
34878,ELAINE, He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.,89
34879,ELAINE, I know he belches a lot.,89
34880,ELAINE, Yeah.,89
34881,ELAINE, What are you doing?,89
34882,ELAINE," No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just													think of that?",89
34883,GEORGE," Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.",89
34884,GEORGE,  Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!,89
34885,GEORGE," Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!",89
34886,GEORGE, I'm following him.,89
34887,ELAINE," And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is													obsessed, he keeps leaving these annoying messages on my machine.",89
34888,JERRY, Would you?,89
34889,KRAMER, Any word from Nana?,89
34890,JERRY, No.,89
34891,ELAINE, Nana?,89
34892,JERRY," Yeah, my grandma's missing.",89
34893,ELAINE, Missing?,89
34894,JERRY, Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.,89
34895,ELAINE," Um, what does Nana sound like?",89
34896,JERRY," Like a grandmother, why?",89
34897,ELAINE, Well...,89
34898,JERRY," Oh, you hung up on my Nana?!",89
34899,ELAINE," I don't know, maybe.",89
34900,JERRY, You told Nana to drop dead?!,89
34901,ELAINE, It's possible.,89
34902,JERRY," Yes, it is!",89
34903,KRAMER," Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.",89
34904,JERRY, Alright.,89
34905,GEORGE, No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!,89
34906,GEORGE," No, you can have it.",89
34907,KRAMER," Jerry, where are all the tote bags?",89
34908,JERRY, I don't know.,89
34909,KRAMER," Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.",89
34910,JERRY, Leo?,89
34911,JERRY, Uncle Leo! What are you doing here?,89
34912,JERRY, Oh.,89
34913,JERRY, He'll be here any second.,89
34914,JERRY," Yeah, yeah.",89
34915,JERRY," No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.",89
34916,JERRY, Please-,89
34917,JERRY, It's not necessary.,89
34918,JERRY," I can't, I can't take it.",89
34919,JERRY," Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!",89
34920,JERRY, I don't want it!!,89
34921,KRAMER, Who's that?,89
34922,JERRY, You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.,89
34923,KRAMER," Jerry, I'll take care of it.",89
34924,KRAMER," Well, he can't be disturbed now.",89
34925,KRAMER," I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.",89
34926,KRAMER," Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know.",89
34927,GEORGE," I'll take care of this, Danny.",89
34928,GEORGE, Excuse me.,89
34929,GEORGE," I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.",89
34930,GEORGE," Outside of Manhattan, about an hour ago.",89
34931,GEORGE," That's right, of the New York Yankees.",89
34932,JERRY," I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.",89
34933,JERRY, This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-,89
34934,KRAMER,  PBS pledge drive.,89
34935,KRAMER," Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.",89
34936,KRAMER," Oh, uh, Nana. Hello.",89
34937,KRAMER," As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.",89
34938,JERRY," -programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'",89
34939,KRAMER, Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.,89
34940,JERRY, My Nana?,89
34941,KRAMER," And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!",89
34942,JERRY, I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.,89
34943,ELAINE, Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-,89
34944,JERRY," Yes, he is.",89
34945,ELAINE, You should show this to Georgie.,89
34946,JERRY, Yeah.,89
34947,JERRY," Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.",89
34948,ELAINE, I just don't get it.,89
34949,JERRY," You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.",89
34950,ELAINE, What is wrong with everybody?,89
34951,JERRY,"  Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!",89
34952,ELAINE,  What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!,89
34953,JERRY,  Good shave today...,90
34954,ELAINE,"  Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.",90
34955,JERRY, I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...,90
34956,ELAINE, Can we rest here a second.,90
34957,JERRY,"  Yeah, I guess.",90
34958,JERRY, ...So how's Noreen?,90
34959,ELAINE, Mmm! She's got a new boyfriend,90
34960,JERRY, Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...,90
34961,ELAINE," No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.",90
34962,JERRY, A Long Talker.,90
34963,ELAINE," Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone",90
34964,JERRY,  All right; let's move it out.,90
34965,JERRY," Hey, isn't that George's father?",90
34966,ELAINE," Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?",90
34967,JERRY, I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.,90
34968,ELAINE, That man he's with,90
34969,JERRY, I believe he is wearing a cape.,90
34970,ELAINE, Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?,90
34971,JERRY," Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.",90
34972,ELAINE," Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?",90
34973,JERRY," You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.",90
34974,JERRY," Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.",90
34975,JERRY, Oh! I got a message. ,90
34976,GEORGE,"  Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... ",90
34977,ELAINE, That sounds urgent...,90
34978,JERRY," Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.",90
34979,ELAINE, Donna Chang?,90
34980,JERRY,  I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.,90
34981,ELAINE, Isn't that a little racist?,90
34982,JERRY," If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!",90
34983,JERRY, So listen...,90
34984,KRAMER, Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water...  Who you talkin' to? ,90
34985,ELAINE, He's on with a Chinese woman.,90
34986,KRAMER," Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.",90
34987,ELAINE, You got a comfort problem there?,90
34988,KRAMER," No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.",90
34989,ELAINE, I thought you wore silk underwear.,90
34990,KRAMER," No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys.  My boys need a house!",90
34991,ELAINE,"  That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.",90
34992,KRAMER, Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?,90
34993,ELAINE, A lot!,90
34994,JERRY, I got a date!,90
34995,ELAINE, With the Chinese woman?!,90
34996,JERRY, She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.,90
34997,KRAMER, Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?,90
34998,JERRY," No, why should I? I wear boxers.",90
34999,KRAMER, You ever get a woman pregnant?,90
35000,JERRY," I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...",90
35001,KRAMER, What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?,90
35002,JERRY," Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!",90
35003,KRAMER, A LOT of 'em!  Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!,90
35004,JERRY," Well, I'm sure you're not... Totally Depleted.",90
35005,KRAMER, Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!,90
35006,JERRY, So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.,90
35007,KRAMER," Yeah, but then I'd have to...  well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??",90
35008,ELAINE," What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?",90
35009,ELAINE,  All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.,90
35010,JERRY, I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!,90
35011,ELAINE, She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?,90
35012,JERRY, She suggested it!,90
35013,ELAINE, I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese...,90
35014,JERRY, She's very assimilated.,90
35015,JERRY, Paul again?,90
35016,ELAINE,  You can't get one ring past him.,90
35017,GEORGE," Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!",90
35018,JERRY, I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!,90
35019,GEORGE, ...Huh?,90
35020,ELAINE," Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.",90
35021,GEORGE," Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?",90
35022,GEORGE, You didn't ask him?,90
35023,GEORGE,  You didn't say hello?,90
35024,ELAINE," Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.",90
35025,GEORGE, Why was he wearing a cape?,90
35026,GEORGE, Was my father wearing a cape?,90
35027,JERRY, No. Jacket and tie,90
35028,GEORGE, Huh... Cape...  What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?...  Why a cape? Hmm! ,90
35029,KRAMER, Oh?,90
35030,KRAMER," Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...",90
35031,KRAMER," Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate--",90
35032,KRAMER, What,90
35033,KRAMER," All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.",90
35034,KRAMER, All the time?,90
35035,KRAMER," Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.",90
35036,ELAINE," Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?!  Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna...  Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh...  Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. ",90
35037,JERRY," Yes, I will.",90
35038,JERRY," No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.",90
35039,JERRY,  'scuse me?,90
35040,JERRY, Who are you?,90
35041,JERRY,  W-what do you mean?,90
35042,JERRY,  You're Donna Chang?,90
35043,JERRY," Oh. No. What, you mean because of the ""Chang""?",90
35044,JERRY, I didn't think so.,90
35045,ELAINE, She's not Chinese?,90
35046,JERRY, No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian.,90
35047,ELAINE, So. What is she?,90
35048,JERRY," Well, she's... like you.",90
35049,ELAINE,"  Oh, how disappointed you must have been. ",90
35050,JERRY," Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as ""Donna Chang""...",90
35051,ELAINE, So then why are you seeing her again...,90
35052,JERRY," Well, she is a woman.",90
35053,ELAINE," Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.",90
35054,JERRY, Really? ,90
35055,ELAINE," Well, maybe.",90
35056,JERRY," Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?",90
35057,ELAINE,  What do you mean?,90
35058,JERRY," Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?",90
35059,KRAMER," Here, take my Jockey shorts.",90
35060,ELAINE, Whoa! Whoa!,90
35061,JERRY," Here, what is that?!!",90
35062,KRAMER," Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.",90
35063,JERRY, Wha--you have a low sperm count?,90
35064,KRAMER," Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.",90
35065,JERRY, Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. ,90
35066,KRAMER," Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!",90
35067,JERRY, Look! I don't want 'em!,90
35068,KRAMER," All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--",90
35069,JERRY, I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!,90
35070,KRAMER," Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!",90
35071,KRAMER, What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! ,90
35072,JERRY,"  Well, I'm gonna have to move now.",90
35073,GEORGE, Plenty of mosquitoes.,90
35074,GEORGE," So, Dad...",90
35075,GEORGE,  Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!,90
35076,GEORGE, Jerry and Elaine saw you.,90
35077,GEORGE," Well, they were in a rush.",90
35078,GEORGE," They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?...",90
35079,GEORGE," So Dad,--",90
35080,JERRY, Did they uncross the lines yet?,90
35081,JERRY,"  Did you say, ""ridicurous""?",90
35082,JERRY,"  I thought you said... ""ridicurous."" ",90
35083,GEORGE, Hey-- ,90
35084,JERRY," Oh, what are you doing here?",90
35085,GEORGE," Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you...  had company.  Hiya, I'm George.",90
35086,GEORGE, You spoke to my mother?,90
35087,JERRY, The rines are crossed?,90
35088,GEORGE," Did you say, ""The rines are crossed?""",90
35089,JERRY, Did I?,90
35090,GEORGE,  Yeah.,90
35091,GEORGE, Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?,90
35092,ELAINE," Ay, divorced. That's really too bad...",90
35093,JERRY," Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.",90
35094,GEORGE, Oh my God!  You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!,90
35095,JERRY," Gee, I never thought of that.",90
35096,GEORGE, Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day?  Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!,90
35097,ELAINE," Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?",90
35098,JERRY, Have you ever spent any time with these people...?,90
35099,GEORGE, You know what this has to do with?,90
35100,ELAINE, What?,90
35101,GEORGE, The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.,90
35102,JERRY, And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.,90
35103,GEORGE, All right Superman's the exception.,90
35104,KRAMER," Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me.  I've always had a thing for Noreen.",90
35105,ELAINE," No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.",90
35106,KRAMER," Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. ",90
35107,JERRY, Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...,90
35108,KRAMER," Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.",90
35109,JERRY, You went back to the Jockeys?,90
35110,KRAMER, Wrong again.,90
35111,JERRY,"  Oh, no.",90
35112,ELAINE, What? What?...,90
35113,JERRY," Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...",90
35114,ELAINE,  Eeaawww...,90
35115,JERRY," The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.",90
35116,KRAMER," Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!",90
35117,JERRY, Don't you need a little... help?,90
35118,KRAMER," Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered...  Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! ",90
35119,ELAINE, So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...,90
35120,ELAINE," Oh, he went insane?...",90
35121,ELAINE,"  Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!",90
35122,ELAINE,"  I'm really sorry, Noreen...",90
35123,ELAINE," Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.",90
35124,JERRY, What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!,90
35125,ELAINE,  I know--,90
35126,JERRY, First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.,90
35127,ELAINE," Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.",90
35128,JERRY," So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world",90
35129,ELAINE,  I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.,90
35130,JERRY," Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman",90
35131,JERRY, Yeah.,90
35132,JERRY,  Come on up. ,90
35133,ELAINE," Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...",90
35134,JERRY," Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?",90
35135,ELAINE,  Okay...,90
35136,JERRY," First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.",90
35137,ELAINE, She was lost...,90
35138,JERRY," Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!",90
35139,ELAINE," Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...",90
35140,JERRY, You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...,90
35141,ELAINE," If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!",90
35142,JERRY," Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine...",90
35143,ELAINE,  Oh.,90
35144,JERRY, Why? What happened?,90
35145,JERRY, Wow! That's amazing!,90
35146,ELAINE,  Huh.,90
35147,JERRY, Tonight?,90
35148,GEORGE, All right.  Let me just say one thing,90
35149,GEORGE,  You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.,90
35150,GEORGE, All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?,90
35151,GEORGE, Your lawyer wears a cape...?,90
35152,GEORGE, Who wears a cape?,90
35153,GEORGE, All right! Come on! Let's not fight.,90
35154,GEORGE,  ehh.  So what made you change your mind?,90
35155,JERRY, So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?,90
35156,JERRY," Confucius, huh?",90
35157,JERRY,"  You know, you're not Chinese...",90
35158,JERRY, Hey! I heard the good news!,90
35159,JERRY, Elaine was... in a rush.,90
35160,KRAMER, Y'ello?,90

35168,KRAMER, Yes she is...,90
35169,ELAINE,  Well... Can I talk to her?,90
35170,KRAMER," Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?",90
35171,ELAINE,  Alright--would you just put her on?,90
35172,KRAMER," Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...",90
35173,ELAINE, YOU feel?,90
35174,KRAMER," That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...",90
35175,ELAINE," What, are you insane?!",90
35176,KRAMER," From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...",90
35177,ELAINE, Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?,90
35178,KRAMER, Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army... There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...,90
35179,ELAINE,  Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!,90
35180,KRAMER," Can't help ya, kid.",90
35181,ELAINE, Get the-- ,90
35182,GEORGE, What?!,90
35183,GEORGE, So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!,90
35184,GEORGE,  Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!,90
35185,JERRY,"  You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...",90
35186,ELAINE," So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!",90
35187,JERRY, Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. ,90
35188,ELAINE,"  You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.",90
35189,ELAINE,"  hu_uh,  You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.",90
35190,JERRY," Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...",90
35191,GEORGE," Oh, it had to happen!!",90
35192,JERRY, Hey.,90
35193,GEORGE," I knew it!!  I predicted it!  Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played ""Clue""! All day with this! [Kew Gardens ]",90
35194,KRAMER,"  Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! ",90
35195,JERRY,"The love seat, that's a nice little item, there...I guess some guy thought, 'Well, if we can't get them to sit closer to us, why not just shorten the furniture?' My other favorite furniture brand is the La-Z-Boy. This is very flattering to the prospective customer, isn't it? Why don't we just call it the 'half-conscious deadbeat with no job, home all day, eating Cheetos and watching TV' recliner? I mean, it goes back so far, that thing...I mean, it's like, 'Go to bed already! It's over! You're wiped!'",91
35196,JERRY," So, she got you to join a book club?",91
35197,GEORGE, I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.,91
35198,JERRY," Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence.  Hey, what about this one?",91
35199,GEORGE," Nah, I don't like that one.",91
35200,JERRY," So, what's your first book?",91
35201,GEORGE," ""Breakfast At Tiffany's."" 90 pages. ",91
35202,JERRY," It's kinda old, isn't it?",91
35203,GEORGE, They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.,91
35204,GEORGE, He's a great writer.,91
35205,JERRY," Oh, yeah.",91
35206,GEORGE, Did you ever read anything by him?,91
35207,JERRY, No. You?,91
35208,GEORGE, Nah.,91
35209,ELAINE," Hey, what's going on?",91
35210,JERRY," New couch, baby!",91
35211,ELAINE, New couch? Why?,91
35212,JERRY," I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.",91
35213,ELAINE," Oh, let me get the door for you.  Ooh, be careful!",91
35214,JERRY," Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.",91
35215,ELAINE, What are you doing with your old couch?,91
35216,JERRY," Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?",91
35217,ELAINE," Yeah, I'll take it.",91
35218,JERRY," Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.",91
35219,ELAINE," Yes, they can. ",91
35220,KRAMER, Hey! Couch is comin.',91
35221,JERRY, It's here!,91
35222,KRAMER," Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.",91
35223,KRAMER, Ooh! Remember Poppie?,91
35224,JERRY," Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?",91
35225,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?",91
35226,JERRY, Yeah.,91
35227,ELAINE, What was that again?,91
35228,KRAMER," It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?",91
35229,JERRY, What made you resurrect that old idea?,91
35230,KRAMER," Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the ""old"" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.",91
35231,ELAINE," I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.",91
35232,JERRY, I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?,91
35233,KRAMER," That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.",91
35234,ELAINE," Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon!",91
35235,KRAMER," Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance.  You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.",91
35236,JERRY," Oh, Kramer, I -",91
35237,JERRY," Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?",91
35238,ELAINE," Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.",91
35239,JERRY," Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.",91
35240,ELAINE," 'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?",91
35241,ELAINE," Oh, goody. Okay, well uh......I'll see you chumps later. ",91
35242,KRAMER, Did you offer those guys a drink?,91
35243,JERRY," Uh, no. Should I have?",91
35244,KRAMER, What kind of a person are you?,91
35245,JERRY, I don't know.,91
35246,GEORGE," Okay. ""Breakfast At Tiffany's."" ",91
35247,ELAINE," So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, ""Do you date moving men?""",91
35248,JERRY, Ah ha...,91
35249,ELAINE, You wanna know what I said?,91
35250,JERRY, I can't wait.,91
35251,ELAINE," ""I do now.""",91
35252,JERRY, Clever.,91
35253,ELAINE, Is that something?,91
35254,JERRY, Yes.,91
35255,ELAINE, Is that something?,91
35256,JERRY," You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.",91
35257,ELAINE," Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.",91
35258,JERRY," So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?",91
35259,ELAINE, Yes.,91
35260,JERRY," Well, would you apologize for me? ",91
35261,ELAINE," Nice to meet you, Poppie.",91
35262,JERRY," Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.",91
35263,ELAINE," Well, your mother must be very proud of you.",91
35264,JERRY," So, what's good tonight?",91
35265,ELAINE," Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.",91
35266,JERRY," Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.",91
35267,ELAINE, Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.,91
35268,JERRY, Why not?,91
35269,ELAINE," Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.",91
35270,JERRY," So, you won't eat the pizza?",91
35271,ELAINE, No way.,91
35272,JERRY, Really.,91
35273,ELAINE, Yeah.,91
35274,JERRY," Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?",91
35275,ELAINE," Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.",91
35276,JERRY, Really!,91
35277,ELAINE, Yeah. That's right.,91
35278,JERRY," Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? ",91
35279,JERRY," Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?",91
35280,JERRY," Oh, boy.",91
35281,JERRY," Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. ",91
35282,JERRY," Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.",91
35283,GEORGE, I'm sorry I missed it.,91
35284,JERRY," Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault.  So, how's the book coming?  I say, how's the book comin'?",91
35285,GEORGE, Oh...pretty good.,91
35286,JERRY," So, what's it about?",91
35287,GEORGE," Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.",91
35288,JERRY, Holly Go-Lightly.,91
35289,GEORGE," Yeah, she's quite a character.",91
35290,JERRY," Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?",91
35291,GEORGE, No.,91
35292,JERRY, Big surprise.,91
35293,GEORGE," I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.",91
35294,JERRY," You're not very bright, are you?",91
35295,GEORGE," No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.",91
35296,JERRY, Why don't you rent the movie?,91
35297,GEORGE," 'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. ",91
35298,JERRY, Oh...well...,91
35299,KRAMER," Did you enjoy the duck?  Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.",91
35300,KRAMER," Alright, what did you do to Poppie?",91
35301,ELAINE, Nothing.,91
35302,KRAMER," Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.",91
35303,ELAINE, What's wrong with him?,91
35304,KRAMER, I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later.  It would be nice if you got him something. ,91
35305,JERRY, We should get him something.,91
35306,ELAINE, Yeah. You're right.,91
35307,ELAINE," Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day.  So, what do you think of my conversation?",91
35308,ELAINE, You don't have any furniture?,91
35309,ELAINE," Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?",91
35310,KRAMER," Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.",91
35311,KRAMER," Why, what...?",91
35312,KRAMER," Well, we're not very close.",91
35313,KRAMER," Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?",91
35314,ELAINE, I'm in looove!,91
35315,JERRY, Whoa!,91
35316,ELAINE," This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!",91
35317,JERRY, Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?,91
35318,ELAINE," No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! ",91
35319,JERRY, No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?,91
35320,JERRY, Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?,91
35321,JERRY, What is his stand...on abortion?,91
35322,ELAINE," Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.",91
35323,JERRY, How do you know?,91
35324,ELAINE," Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.",91
35325,JERRY," Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.",91
35326,GEORGE, I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.,91
35327,GEORGE," Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.",91
35328,GEORGE, Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.,91
35329,GEORGE," Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.",91
35330,GEORGE," Uh, excuse me, are you Joe Temple?",91
35331,GEORGE," Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?",91
35332,KRAMER, Hey.,91
35333,JERRY," Hey, what's happenin.'",91
35334,KRAMER," Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.",91
35335,JERRY, You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.,91
35336,KRAMER," Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. ",91
35337,JERRY," Okay. Hi, Poppie.",91
35338,JERRY," I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.",91
35339,JERRY, Okay. I'll get it. ,91
35340,KRAMER," Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating.  What, are you tired, Poppie?",91
35341,KRAMER," Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?",91
35342,JERRY, ...the...the...,91
35343,KRAMER, What is what?,91
35344,JERRY, This puddle on my sofa!,91
35345,KRAMER, What puddle?,91
35346,KRAMER, I don't know.,91
35347,KRAMER, Are you sure?,91
35348,JERRY," Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!",91
35349,KRAMER, I'm sure it'll come out.,91
35350,JERRY," I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!",91
35351,KRAMER," Ah, you're making too much of it.",91
35352,KRAMER, Right!,91
35353,GEORGE," Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.",91
35354,GEORGE, She was a delicate flower.,91
35355,GEORGE," Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... ",91
35356,ELAINE, Hi. ,91
35357,ELAINE," Oh, I missed you!",91
35358,ELAINE," Me, either!",91
35359,ELAINE, You do?,91
35360,ELAINE," Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.",91
35361,ELAINE," Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. ",91
35362,GEORGE," So, anything to uh, nosh?",91
35363,GEORGE, Popcorn?,91
35364,GEORGE," Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.",91
35365,GEORGE," You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.",91
35366,GEORGE, Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.,91
35367,GEORGE," Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'",91
35368,KRAMER, And...cucumbers! ,91
35369,KRAMER, It's cucumbers.,91
35370,KRAMER," Well, why not? I like cucumbers.",91
35371,KRAMER," But that's the idea, you make your own pie.",91
35372,KRAMER, What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?,91
35373,KRAMER, It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!,91
35374,KRAMER," No, it isn't!",91
35375,GEORGE," You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.",91
35376,GEORGE, Any more grape juice? ,91
35377,GEORGE," So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking?  Okay, c'mon. Let's go.",91
35378,GEORGE," C'mon, you took my seat.",91
35379,GEORGE," I was sitting there, c'mon.",91
35380,GEORGE, I had the arm! Joe...,91
35381,GEORGE," Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...",91
35382,GEORGE," Alright, c'mon, scooch over. ",91
35383,GEORGE, Joe...,91
35384,ELAINE, Oh my god.,91
35385,JERRY, You see?!,91
35386,ELAINE," So, you're gonna get a new couch?",91
35387,JERRY," Well, I guess I have no choice.",91
35388,ELAINE, Do you want your old couch back?,91
35389,JERRY, I was hoping you'd offer.  Yeah?,91
35390,JERRY, 'Kay. ,91
35391,ELAINE, Who's that?,91
35392,JERRY," Your boyfriend, he's taking it out.",91
35393,ELAINE," No, no, he's not my boyfriend.",91
35394,JERRY, Why?,91
35395,ELAINE, Take a guess.,91
35396,JERRY," Oh, really. ",91
35397,ELAINE, Hi.,91
35398,JERRY," Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.",91
35399,JERRY, Could you?,91
35400,JERRY, George is taking it.,91
35401,ELAINE, Did you tell him it was peed on?,91
35402,JERRY," He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.",91
35403,ELAINE," Yeah, me too.",91
35404,ELAINE, Yeah. It is.,91
35405,ELAINE, Can I offer you anything to drink?,91
35406,GEORGE," Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.",91
35407,JERRY," I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? ""Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!""",92
35408,JERRY," I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" thing.",92
35409,GEORGE, I think she finds my stupidity charming.,92
35410,JERRY, As we all do.,92
35411,GEORGE," Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.",92
35412,JERRY," Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?",92
35413,GEORGE," Yeah, I'll zip in, ""How do you do?"", zip out. She'll love me.",92
35414,JERRY, You're good with the mothers.,92
35415,GEORGE," Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.",92
35416,JERRY, Maybe you should date the mothers.,92
35417,GEORGE," Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.",92
35418,JERRY," Oh, you got something goin'.",92
35419,GEORGE, Yeah.,92
35420,KRAMER,  Hey.,92
35421,GEORGE, Hey! ,92
35422,KRAMER," Hey, you got a hammer?",92
35423,JERRY, What do you need a hammer for?,92
35424,KRAMER," Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.",92
35425,JERRY," Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.",92
35426,KRAMER," No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?",92
35427,JERRY," Nah, I don't think so.",92
35428,KRAMER,"  George, you wanna go for a ride?",92
35429,GEORGE,  Nah.,92
35430,KRAMER," Oh, COME ON!",92
35431,JERRY," Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?",92
35432,KRAMER," All right, I've had it with you two. ",92
35433,JERRY," Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?",92
35434,KRAMER, A gymnast!,92
35435,JERRY," Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.",92
35436,KRAMER," A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.",92
35437,JERRY," Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.",92
35438,KRAMER,"  ""Bailing""?",92
35439,JERRY," Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.",92
35440,KRAMER," Jerry, you should pay that price.",92
35441,JERRY," She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?",92
35442,KRAMER, Ch- oo-... what?,92
35443,GEORGE,"  A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.",92
35444,JERRY,  What is this?,92
35445,GEORGE," What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on.",92
35446,JERRY,"  ""Back on""? What was it doing off?",92
35447,GEORGE," I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the ""office"".",92
35448,JERRY,  What for?,92
35449,GEORGE," Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.",92

35473,KRAMER," Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then...  Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!",92

35495,ELAINE," Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.",92
35496,JERRY,"  So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.",92
35497,JERRY," He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. ""I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!""",92
35498,JERRY," No, you'd have to be crazy.",92
35499,JERRY," Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.",92

35501,GEORGE," No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!",92
35502,JERRY, Was it in the trash?,92
35503,GEORGE, Yes.,92
35504,JERRY, Then it was trash.,92
35505,GEORGE," It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.",92
35506,JERRY, But it was in the cylinder!,92
35507,GEORGE, Above the rim.,92
35508,JERRY," Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.",92
35509,GEORGE, It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.,92
35510,JERRY, Was it eaten?,92
35511,GEORGE, One little bite.,92
35512,JERRY," Well, that's garbage.",92
35513,GEORGE, But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!,92
35514,JERRY," Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.",92
35515,JERRY, Hey!,92
35516,KRAMER, Hey.,92
35517,JERRY, What's with you?,92
35518,KRAMER, I got a stone.,92
35519,JERRY, What stone?,92
35520,KRAMER, A kidney stone.,92
35521,JERRY," What is that, anyway?",92
35522,KRAMER," It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!",92
35523,JERRY," Oh, that's gotta hurt.",92
35524,ELAINE," Ah. The ""stock swap"". Let's swap some stock. ",92
35525,ELAINE," All right.  Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?",92
35526,ELAINE,"  ""Moland""?",92
35527,ELAINE," Yeah, I know, but... ""Moland""? I wouldn't drink anything called ""Moland"".",92
35528,ELAINE," Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?",92
35529,GEORGE,"  No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time.  It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye.  I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.",92
35530,JERRY, Good for you.,92
35531,GEORGE," Yes, good for me!",92
35532,JERRY," Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.",92
35533,GEORGE," Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!",92
35534,KRAMER,  Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! ,92
35535,JERRY," Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.",92
35536,KRAMER," Jerry, what is your problem?",92
35537,JERRY," Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.",92
35538,KRAMER," All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?",92
35539,JERRY, No.,92
35540,KRAMER, Tantric yoga?,92
35541,JERRY, No.,92
35542,KRAMER," Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!",92
35543,JERRY," Boy, you can really talk some trash.  I guess that's better than eating it.",92
35544,KRAMER," All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? ",92
35545,JERRY, All right.,92
35546,GEORGE, Did you pass your stone yet?,92
35547,KRAMER, Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.,92
35548,JERRY,"  Hey, that's her!",92
35549,KRAMER," Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her.  Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing!  Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape?  Well, I'll take that as a yes.",92
35550,JERRY,"  Well, here we are.",92
35551,JERRY," How did you stay on that beam like that?  I mean, it's only this wide!",92
35552,JERRY, Oh boy...,92
35553,JERRY," I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a ""magical world"" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.",92
35554,ELAINE," Well, what did you think she was gonna do?",92
35555,JERRY," Well, you know. I mean... I dunno.",92
35556,ELAINE," No, what?",92
35557,JERRY," Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...",92
35558,ELAINE," What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...",92
35559,JERRY," You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...",92
35560,ELAINE," Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?",92
35561,JERRY," Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.",92
35562,KRAMER, You mean like the uneven parallel bars?,92
35563,JERRY," See, again, I really don't feel that...",92
35564,ELAINE, The balance beam?,92
35565,JERRY, Could we stop?,92
35566,ELAINE,  Not the pommel horse?,92
35567,JERRY, All right. Let's just drop it.,92
35568,JERRY, So lemme ask you this,92
35569,ELAINE," I dunno, at least three weeks.",92
35570,JERRY,"  Oh, great.",92
35571,ELAINE," Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.",92
35572,JERRY, Between Poland and Morgan?,92
35573,ELAINE, Yeah. Started a big name controversy.,92
35574,JERRY, Kramer! The stone!,92
35575,JERRY," What happened, did you pass the stone?",92
35576,KRAMER,"  No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.",92
35577,GEORGE,"  ""...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie...""  You call this coffee? ",92
35578,GEORGE, I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-,92
35579,GEORGE," Oh, sure. Of course.  Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second.  Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.",92
35580,GEORGE, Look at this sparkle.  Mrs. Enright!  Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!,92
35581,GEORGE,"  No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. ",92
35582,JERRY, Strike two!,92
35583,GEORGE, You think I'm going down?,92
35584,JERRY, You're behind in the count.,92
35585,GEORGE, I know.,92
35586,KRAMER,"  Hey, what are you doing later?",92
35587,JERRY," I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.",92
35588,KRAMER," Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time",92
35589,JERRY," If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.",92
35590,KRAMER," All right, where you going?",92
35591,JERRY, We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.,92
35592,KRAMER," Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon.",92
35593,JERRY," Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!",92
35594,KRAMER," No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.",92
35595,JERRY," Yeah, well you're going.",92
35596,KRAMER," Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!",92
35597,ELAINE," Well, I couldn't help it. ""Moland Spring""?",92
35598,ELAINE," Well, I'm so sorry! I-",92
35599,ELAINE," Oh, sorry.  Hello?",92

35737,JERRY," Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didn’t like the looks of the defense and changed the play.",93
35738,GEORGE, I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.,93
35739,JERRY, Uh huh.,93
35740,GEORGE, I mentioned how I liked horse manure.,93
35741,JERRY, You did?,93
35742,GEORGE, Yeah.,93
35743,JERRY, Yeah. You said you liked horse manure.,93
35744,GEORGE, Yeah.,93
35745,JERRY,  Mm-hm.,93
35746,GEORGE," You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a “nure,” with a “ma” in front of it. MA-NURE. I’z not bad.",93
35747,JERRY, And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?,93
35748,GEORGE," Yeah.  ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.",93
35749,JERRY, I’m just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.,93
35750,GEORGE, So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?,93
35751,JERRY," My honest opinion, I think she made it up.",93
35752,GEORGE," Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?",93
35753,KRAMER, Hey.,93
35754,JERRY," Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?",93
35755,KRAMER," Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.",93
35756,GEORGE, Well what do you eat?,93
35757,KRAMER," It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.",93
35758,JERRY, Well I’m glad it's working out.,93
35759,KRAMER," Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggie’s.",93
35760,JERRY," Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.",93
35761,KRAMER," Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, I’ll tell you, she's a full-figured gal.",93
35762,JERRY, Is she?,93
35763,KRAMER," Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.",93
35764,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.",93
35765,KRAMER, All right it's done.,93
35766,JERRY, Hello?,93
35767,JERRY," Oh, Hi.",93
35768,JERRY," Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?",93
35769,JERRY, No I haven't?,93
35770,JERRY, All right.,93
35771,JERRY,"  Yeah, I really needed that suit.",93
35772,JERRY, Mm. That's fantastic. ,93
35773,JERRY, No I don't.,93
35774,JERRY, Why?,93
35775,JERRY," No, not yet.",93
35776,JERRY, I’ll have the salmon.,93
35777,JERRY, Another time? What other time?,93
35778,JERRY," No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.",93
35779,JERRY, I’m not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.,93
35780,JERRY, Then that's the meal.,93
35781,JERRY, I didn’t tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?,93
35782,JERRY," All right, fine. Get the soup!",93
35783,JERRY, So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.,93
35784,ELAINE, What kind of soup did he get?,93
35785,JERRY, I don't know? Consommé or something.,93
35786,ELAINE," Consommé, hmm.",93
35787,JERRY, What?,93
35788,ELAINE," Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.",93
35789,JERRY, Elaine you're missing the whole point.,93
35790,ELAINE, What?,93
35791,JERRY," The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.",93
35792,ELAINE, Was it a cup or a bowl?,93
35793,JERRY," You see -- ah, uh ...",93
35794,ELAINE, I’m just curious.,93
35795,JERRY," A bowl, ok?",93
35796,ELAINE, Did he crumble any crackers in it?,93
35797,ELAINE,"  Did he crumble, any crackers in it?",93
35798,JERRY," As a mater of fact, he did.",93
35799,ELAINE," Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.",93
35800,JERRY, It's like I’m talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.,93
35801,ELAINE," Oh, hi Simon. This is Jerry.",93
35802,ELAINE," Um, yeah in my purse.",93
35803,JERRY," Well, I have some money. What do you need? ",93
35804,ELAINE, Where you going?,93
35805,ELAINE," Oh, OK, see you later.",93
35806,ELAINE,  Pardon?,93
35807,JERRY, So is she working? Is she here?,93
35808,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, she's here.",93
35809,JERRY, Have you said anything to her?,93
35810,GEORGE," No, but I’m very uncomfortable.",93
35811,JERRY, Are you going to say anything?,93
35812,GEORGE, There she is.  No no no no no no.,93
35813,GEORGE, Hello.,93
35814,GEORGE, What's it gonna be?,93
35815,GEORGE," I’ll eh, I’ll just have a bowl of chili.",93
35816,JERRY, I’ll have an egg white omelet.,93
35817,GEORGE, What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?,93
35818,JERRY," Yeah, that was bad.",93
35819,GEORGE, Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter -  - there's no more banter.,93
35820,JERRY," Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. ",93
35821,JERRY, Hey.,93
35822,JERRY," Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it.",93
35823,JERRY," ... Oh, I’m joking.",93
35824,GEORGE, Sure you can.,93
35825,JERRY, Why don't you get a sandwich?,93
35826,JERRY, OK ...  This is it ‘cha know,93
35827,JERRY, This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.,93
35828,JERRY, Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.,93
35829,JERRY, I tried to do that.,93
35830,JERRY," Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.",93
35831,KRAMER,"  Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.",93
35832,GEORGE, Yeah.,93
35833,KRAMER, She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.,93
35834,JERRY, Hi.,93
35835,ELAINE, Hi.,93
35836,JERRY, Where's Simon?,93
35837,ELAINE," Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And I’m not expecting ... any change. ",93
35838,JERRY, When's he leaving? ,93
35839,ELAINE," About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. ",93
35840,JERRY," Ah, no thanks.",93
35841,JERRY,"  Hello? No, I’m sorry Bania ... I’m not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.",93
35842,JERRY," Hey, what size suit are you?",93
35843,JERRY," 40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?",93
35844,JERRY," Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, here’s the car keys. ",93
35845,ELAINE, Thanks,93
35846,JERRY, Yo?,93
35847,JERRY, I don't have your suit. I gave it away.,93
35848,JERRY, Well it's gone. I’m sorry. Good-bye Bania.,93
35849,KRAMER, Hey.,93
35850,JERRY, Hey.,93
35851,KRAMER," Um, yeah.  Oh, uh ... well, how's everything? ",93
35852,JERRY, Ok.,93
35853,KRAMER," Good, ah,  what's going on?",93
35854,JERRY, Nothing.,93
35855,KRAMER, Really.,93
35856,JERRY," You want food, don't cha? ",93
35857,KRAMER," It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. ",93
35858,JERRY," All right, go ahead",93
35859,KRAMER, Thanks buddy. ,93
35860,KRAMER," Uh, yeah, ah ...",93
35861,KRAMER," There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ...",93
35862,KRAMER," Uh, Swiss.",93
35863,JERRY, What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?,93
35864,GEORGE, I can't go in there. I’m too uncomfortable.,93
35865,JERRY," Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?",93
35866,ELAINE," Hey, What are you doing out here?",93
35867,JERRY," We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.",93
35868,GEORGE, What's the difference? Let's go to Reggie’s.,93
35869,ELAINE, Reggie’s? I can't eat anything there.,93
35870,GEORGE, It's the same menu.,93
35871,ELAINE, There's no “Big Salad.”,93
35872,GEORGE," They'll make you a “Big Salad.” What do you think, they're the only one's that make a “Big Salad”?",93
35873,ELAINE," All right. Let's go, to Reggie’s.",93
35874,JERRY, So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?,93
35875,ELAINE, Ahh ... wait till you hear this.,93
35876,ELAINE," So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.",93
35877,JERRY," Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, “No egg white omelets.” Look at that.",93
35878,GEORGE, So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.,93
35879,JERRY," Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?",93
35880,JERRY," All right, just give me a western. ",93
35881,ELAINE, How ‘bout a Big Salad?,93
35882,ELAINE,  Ya see?,93
35883,GEORGE," Just tell her what’cha want, they'll make it for ya.",93
35884,ELAINE," It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.",93
35885,ELAINE, Could you put it in a big bowl?,93
35886,ELAINE, All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.,93
35887,GEORGE," I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.",93
35888,JERRY, Not fair.,93
35889,GEORGE," If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!",93
35890,JERRY, She's on your turf.,93
35891,GEORGE, If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.,93
35892,JERRY, You're the best.,93
35893,GEORGE, Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?,93
35894,JERRY," Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.",93
35895,KRAMER, H-Hey. She's hungry Jerry.,93
35896,JERRY," Well, there's nothing left. There's no food.",93
35897,KRAMER, No food? Well you gotta have something --  -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.,93
35898,KRAMER," There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.",93
35899,JERRY, Why'd she get fired?,93
35900,KRAMER," Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didn’t like it.",93
35901,ELAINE," So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.",93
35902,JERRY," Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?",93
35903,ELAINE, Yes. He's one of those bounders.,93
35904,ELAINE, AHhh. Thank you.,93
35905,ELAINE, Ah ,93
35906,JERRY, I don't have it. You want half my omelet? ,93
35907,ELAINE, When are you leaving?,93
35908,ELAINE,  Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?,93
35909,ELAINE, There it goes. ,93
35910,GEORGE," I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.",94
35911,JERRY," Okay, Tim. You're welcome. ",94
35912,ELAINE, Was that Tim Whatley?,94
35913,JERRY," Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party.  You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?",94
35914,ELAINE, I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? ,94
35915,JERRY," Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.",94
35916,ELAINE, Why?,94
35917,JERRY," He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy.  Away from the gums... ",94
35918,JERRY, Uh - new car!,94
35919,ELAINE, Ohhh!,94
35920,JERRY, Hey! Did you get the Volvo?,94
35921,GEORGE," No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.",94
35922,ELAINE, A LeBaron?,94
35923,JERRY, I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.,94
35924,GEORGE, What Consumer? I'm the consumer.,94
35925,JERRY, Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.,94
35926,GEORGE," Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.",94
35927,ELAINE, Jon Voight? The actor?,94
35928,JERRY, You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?,94
35929,JERRY," I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.",94
35930,GEORGE," Alright, maybe I do. So what.",94
35931,ELAINE," I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. ",94
35932,KRAMER, Hey.,94
35933,JERRY, Hey.,94
35934,KRAMER," Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.",94
35935,ELAINE, I like coffee.,94
35936,GEORGE," I like  ""cookies.""",94
35937,KRAMER," Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.",94
35938,GEORGE," Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.",94
35939,KRAMER," Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'",94
35940,JERRY, I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.,94
35941,KRAMER," Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.",94
35942,JERRY," Alright, take 'em.",94
35943,KRAMER," Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.",94
35944,KRAMER," Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.",94
35945,KRAMER," Oh, well, no rush.  Uh oh.",94
35946,KRAMER," Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds.",94
35947,KRAMER," Yeah.  Hey, what's with your ceiling? ",94
35948,KRAMER," Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.",94
35949,ELAINE," Yes, Mr. Pitt?",94
35950,ELAINE," No, I'm still working on it.",94
35951,ELAINE," Artie Shaw. ""Honeysuckle Jump."" ",94
35952,ELAINE," Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.",94
35953,ELAINE," Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?",94
35954,ELAINE," Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. ",94
35955,ELAINE, Will you shut up? I can't hear!,94
35956,ELAINE," Oh! I've got it! It's ""Next Stop Pottersville""! ",94
35957,GEORGE, You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.,94
35958,JERRY," I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.",94
35959,GEORGE," What do you mean ""might""? You don't think he really owned this car?",94
35960,JERRY, I don't know.,94
35961,GEORGE," Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?",94
35962,JERRY," Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.",94
35963,GEORGE," Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. ",94
35964,JERRY," Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.",94
35965,GEORGE," Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.",94
35966,JERRY, Let me get a clean pair. ,94
35967,KRAMER, You said take 'em.,94
35968,JERRY, Not all of 'em!,94
35969,KRAMER," Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.",94
35970,JERRY, Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?,94
35971,KRAMER," Jerry, I left you a pair right here... C'mon. There, put on those boots.",94
35972,JERRY, I can't wear these!,94
35973,KRAMER," Well, why not?",94
35974,JERRY, They're uncomfortable.,94
35975,KRAMER," C'mon here, try 'em on. ",94
35976,GEORGE, Where did you get those?,94
35977,JERRY," I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these!  They look ridiculous!",94
35978,KRAMER," Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?",94
35979,JERRY, But I don't wanna be a cowboy!,94
35980,KRAMER," Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.",94
35981,GEORGE," Yeah, I got one too.",94
35982,KRAMER, Yeah?,94
35983,JERRY, Oh yeah? Huh.,94
35984,GEORGE, What?,94
35985,JERRY," No, nothing.",94
35986,GEORGE," No, what is it?",94
35987,JERRY," No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.",94
35988,GEORGE, You didn't get one?,94
35989,JERRY," Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.",94
35990,KRAMER, Not necessarily.,94
35991,JERRY," Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?",94
35992,KRAMER," Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.",94
35993,GEORGE, So?,94
35994,JERRY," C'mon, put the top up, it's November!",94
35995,GEORGE," I feel alive, Jerry.",94
35996,JERRY, Let's check out the glove box.  Ah. Pencil.,94
35997,GEORGE," Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!",94
35998,JERRY, With Jon Voight's teeth marks.  Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.,94
35999,GEORGE, Ah! See? I told ya.,94
36000,JERRY, Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.,94
36001,GEORGE, So?,94
36002,JERRY, Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?,94
36003,JERRY," Nothing. I'm sure ""Jon"" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! ",94
36004,JERRY, What?,94
36005,GEORGE," That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!",94
36006,GEORGE, Get out!,94
36007,JERRY, And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!,94
36008,GEORGE, Get out!! ,94
36009,GEORGE, Did they take anything?,94
36010,JERRY," No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.",94
36011,GEORGE," Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.",94
36012,JERRY, You really seemed to enjoy it.,94
36013,GEORGE," It was kinda fun.  You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.",94
36014,GEORGE," How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.",94
36015,GEORGE," Heh, that's right. See ya later. ",94
36016,ELAINE," So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.",94
36017,JERRY," Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?",94
36018,ELAINE," Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...",94
36019,JERRY, Yeah...,94
36020,ELAINE," And I asked him, ""Should Jerry bring anything?""",94
36021,JERRY, So...?,94
36022,ELAINE," Mmmm...and he said, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?""",94
36023,JERRY," Alright, but let me ask you this question.",94
36024,ELAINE, What?,94
36025,JERRY," Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?"" or, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?"" You emphasize ""Jerry"" or ""bring.""",94
36026,ELAINE," I think he emphasized ""would.""",94
36027,JERRY," You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. ",94
36028,KRAMER, Hey.,94
36029,JERRY," Hey, so where's my sneakers?",94
36030,KRAMER, That's what I wanna know.,94
36031,JERRY, What do you mean?,94
36032,KRAMER," Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.",94
36033,JERRY, So all my sneakers are gone?,94
36034,KRAMER, I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.,94
36035,JERRY, Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!,94
36036,KRAMER," It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.",94
36037,KRAMER, Apparently.,94
36038,ELAINE," Alright, that's enough of this.",94
36039,JERRY, Where ya goin'?,94
36040,ELAINE, I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.,94
36041,JERRY, Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?,94
36042,ELAINE," He finds his laugh ""intoxicating."" ",94
36043,GEORGE," Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.",94
36044,GEORGE," I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.",94
36045,ELAINE," Um, it was, uh...""Next Stop Pottersville.""  Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?",94
36046,KRAMER, Oh. Oh man. ,94
36047,KRAMER," Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight!  Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...",94
36048,JERRY," No Jon Voight Day, huh?",94
36049,GEORGE," No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?",94
36050,JERRY," Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.",94
36051,GEORGE, You should have somebody take a look at that.,94
36052,JERRY," I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.",94
36053,GEORGE, You going to the party?,94
36054,JERRY," No, I don't know if I'm invited.",94
36055,GEORGE," Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.",94
36056,JERRY," Yeah, you're right.",94
36057,GEORGE, You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.,94
36058,JERRY," Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.",94
36059,GEORGE, Maybe I'll just meet you there.,94
36060,JERRY, You don't want to go with me?,94
36061,GEORGE," Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?",94
36062,JERRY," The way I feel when I go places with you?  Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?",94
36063,KRAMER," No.  But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?",94
36064,GEORGE, Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?,94
36065,KRAMER," Well, he was a little standoffish.",94
36066,GEORGE," What, you didn't ask him about the car?",94
36067,KRAMER," No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me.  Look.",94
36068,JERRY, What?,94
36069,KRAMER, His tooth marks. He bit me.,94
36070,GEORGE, Jon Voight bit you?,94
36071,JERRY," Well, what is he, a vampire?",94
36072,KRAMER," No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.",94
36073,KRAMER," That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!",94
36074,JERRY," Oh, please.",94
36075,GEORGE," Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.",94
36076,JERRY," No, it's stupid.",94
36077,GEORGE," Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.",94
36078,JERRY, So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.,94
36079,GEORGE, It's worth a shot. ,94
36080,JERRY," So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?",94
36081,KRAMER," Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.",94
36082,GEORGE," These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.",94
36083,KRAMER, You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?,94
36084,GEORGE," Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?",94
36085,KRAMER, That's right. He's a troublemaker.,94
36086,JERRY," Hey, Elaine. Did you get my message?",94
36087,ELAINE, What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?,94
36088,ELAINE, What? I can't hear you.,94
36089,JERRY," Elaine, would you marry me?",94
36090,ELAINE," I told you, I can't hear a word.",94
36091,JERRY, Alright. Forget it.,94
36092,GEORGE," Hey, Tim.",94
36093,GEORGE," Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.",94
36094,GEORGE," Let me show you something, take a look at this... ",94
36095,KRAMER, He didn't come with us. ,94
36096,GEORGE," Uh, Tim, the pencil...",94
36097,JERRY," Hey, Tim.",94
36098,JERRY," Did you say, ""Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"" or, ""Jerry, I didn't think you'd show""? ",94
36099,ELAINE, Tim.,94
36100,ELAINE, What?,94
36101,GEORGE, Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?,94
36102,KRAMER, Not just someone. Jon Voight.,94
36103,GEORGE, That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.,94
36104,GEORGE," Jon Voight, the actor?",94
36105,JERRY, Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.,94
36106,KRAMER, Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker!,94
36107,KRAMER, Those kids look pretty disappointed.,94
36108,JERRY, Especially that big kid up in the front.  How old is he?  Hello?,94
36109,JERRY, Yes it is.,94
36110,JERRY," Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much.  I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!",94
36111,KRAMER, Where are they?,94
36112,JERRY," Parsippany, New Jersey.",94
36113,KRAMER, Let's go!,94
36114,JERRY, My car's in the shop.,94
36115,KRAMER," Well, how are we getting to Parsippany?",94
36116,KRAMER, Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again.,94
36117,GEORGE, Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.,95
36118,JERRY, That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.,95
36119,GEORGE," Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.",95
36120,JERRY, From your mother.,95
36121,JERRY," So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the “Spokes model” category?",95
36122,GEORGE," Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. I’ll never get any work done. So I’m doing a complete 360. I’m going for total efficiency and ability.",95
36123,JERRY," That's a 180, George.",95
36124,GEORGE, Whatever.,95
36125,JERRY, Hi Willie.,95
36126,JERRY, I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.,95
36127,JERRY," Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.",95
36128,JERRY, Hi.,95
36129,JERRY," Yeah, that's why I said “hi”.",95
36130,JERRY, Thanks. It's Hounds-Tooth.,95
36131,JERRY," Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.",95
36132,GEORGE,"  Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. I’m looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, I’m afraid this is not going to work out  Thanks for coming in.",95
36133,GEORGE, You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. I’m terribly sorry. ,95
36134,GEORGE, I can't imagine.,95
36135,ELAINE," Ok, So Barney’s is having this huge sale. I try this dress on --  -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.",95
36136,JERRY, Yeah.,95
36137,ELAINE," OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like I’m carrying twins.",95
36138,JERRY," So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.",95
36139,ELAINE, Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.,95
36140,JERRY, I thought we were going to the movies?,95
36141,ELAINE, All right I’ll try it on again. You tell me what you think. ,95
36142,GEORGE, Hey hey.,95
36143,ELAINE, Hey George,95
36144,GEORGE," Hey Elaine.  I’m telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible.  I don't know why I didn’t have one before.",95
36145,JERRY, Because you didn’t have a job?,95
36146,GEORGE," Perhaps.  I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.",95
36147,JERRY, A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the “dish” and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.,95
36148,JERRY, It's a little ...,95
36149,ELAINE, All Right!  You answered it right there.,95
36150,JERRY, You got no waist in that thing.,95
36151,GEORGE, You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.,95
36152,ELAINE," I said, All Right.",95
36153,GEORGE, Well wha’d you buy it for?,95
36154,ELAINE," Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barney’s, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi  Moore in Indecent Proposal.",95
36155,JERRY, How fast was she walking?,95
36156,GEORGE, Demi ? I thought it was Demi?,95
36157,JERRY, No. I think it's Demi. ,95
36158,GEORGE, Really? I never heard of a semi  tractor-trailer. ,95
36159,ELAINE, Wait a minute  Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! ,95

36162,JERRY," Oh, you're crazy.",95
36163,ELAINE, Am I?  Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barney’s?,95
36164,GEORGE,  You know I think she might have something there.,95
36165,KRAMER, Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?,95
36166,ELAINE, Oh I’m returning this dress to Barney’s.,95
36167,KRAMER, Good idea.,95
36168,JERRY, Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.,95
36169,ELAINE," Yeah yeah, ok.",95
36170,KRAMER," Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.",95
36171,ELAINE, Moisturizer? That's girls stuff.,95
36172,KRAMER," No no, look. I’ll tell you what -- they're having a sale right.",95

36174,KRAMER," I’ll meetcha down there, well have lunch.",95
36175,ELAINE, Well we could ...,95
36176,KRAMER," Well, we’ll get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... ",95
36177,GEORGE," And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So let’s clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.",95
36178,GEORGE," Ade, you're a wonder. ",95
36179,GEORGE," Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.",95
36180,GEORGE," I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.",95
36181,GEORGE," It's like I’m thinking of something, and you're  one step ahead of me.",95
36182,GEORGE,"  Do you, uh ... do you know what I’m ... thinking about now?",95
36183,GEORGE," Is it, uh, doable?",95
36184,JERRY," Well, that was the worst.",95
36185,ELAINE, I can’t believe they made the Wife the killer.  Gimme a break.,95
36186,KRAMER, You got a pen?,95
36187,JERRY," Yeah, I think I do.",95
36188,KRAMER, And I need something to write on.,95
36189,JERRY," Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.",95
36190,KRAMER," I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.",95
36191,JERRY, Uma Therman? Really?,95
36192,KRAMER, Yeah.,95
36193,ELAINE, How'd you manage that.,95
36194,KRAMER, Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. ,95
36195,JERRY," He's got the Kavorca.  Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?",95
36196,ELAINE, Where?,95
36197,JERRY," He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.",95
36198,ELAINE, What would he be doing wearing your jacket?,95
36199,JERRY, It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.,95
36200,ELAINE, Are you sure?,95
36201,KRAMER," I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. ",95
36202,ELAINE, You are amazing.,95

36205,GEORGE," What? Oh, My God!",95
36206,GEORGE," Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... I’m giving you a raise!",95
36207,JERRY," So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out “I’m giving you a raise.”",95
36208,GEORGE, Yeah.,95
36209,JERRY, Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?,95
36210,GEORGE," Not that I’m aware of, no.",95
36211,JERRY," So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.",95
36212,GEORGE, I didn’t think ahead.,95
36213,JERRY, Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.,95
36214,GEORGE, I didn’t say any other bawdy things.,95
36215,JERRY, Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.,95
36216,GEORGE," All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.",95
36217,JERRY," All right, all right. I’m sorry.",95
36218,GEORGE," Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenner’s office and tell him he has to give her a raise.",95
36219,JERRY, How long has she been there?,95
36220,GEORGE, 3 days.,95
36221,JERRY, It's almost a week.,95
36222,JERRY," Oh, My god.",95
36223,GEORGE, What?,95
36224,JERRY, It's a movie stub from the 9,95
36225,ELAINE," These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.",95
36226,ELAINE, OK fine.  I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... ,95
36227,ELAINE, Ok thanks so much.  What are you all dressed up for?,95
36228,KRAMER," Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.",95
36229,ELAINE, I like your little bag.,95
36230,KRAMER," Huh, oh hey, look at this.  It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.",95
36231,ELAINE, Huh.,95
36232,KRAMER, Wait till that Uma smells this Uva.,95
36233,KRAMER," Hey Bania, what's happening? ",95
36234,KRAMER," Well, thank you.",95
36235,KRAMER," No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.",95
36236,KRAMER, I sure am.,95
36237,KRAMER,  That don't make you look high-waisted.,95
36238,KRAMER, Me too.,95
36239,KRAMER," Uh, 42.",95
36240,KRAMER, make me an offer.,95
36241,KRAMER, Surely you jest. ,95
36242,KRAMER, Look at the stitching  This is old world craftsmanship.,95
36243,KRAMER, Sold. Follow me into the dressing room.,95
36244,KRAMER," Bania, you're killing me.",95
36245,KRAMER, There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.,95
36246,GEORGE,"  Mr. Steinbrenner,  can I talk to you for a second?",95
36247,GEORGE," Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.",95
36248,GEORGE, She supports her whole family. ,95
36249,GEORGE," Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. ",95
36250,GEORGE, She can’t even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.,95
36251,GEORGE, You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.,95
36252,KRAMER, Psst. Hey.,95
36253,ELAINE," Kramer, what are you doing here?",95
36254,KRAMER," Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.",95

36256,KRAMER," Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.",95
36257,ELAINE, So go buy a new one.,95
36258,KRAMER," What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.",95
36259,ELAINE, So.,95
36260,KRAMER," Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.",95
36261,ELAINE, Ouhhh ,95

36264,JERRY, Yeah. Specifically 9,95
36265,JERRY, I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.,95
36266,JERRY, You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples’ clothes,95
36267,JERRY," Yeahhh, am I imagining this?  Found this little cutie in the pocket. ",95
36268,JERRY," Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- I’ll be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.",95
36269,JERRY, Now.,95

36274,JERRY," All right, I’ll be back.",95
36275,ELAINE," Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?",95
36276,ELAINE," I don't know, I have to think about it.  I need a nonpartisan mirror.",95
36277,GEORGE," Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didn’t get it, that I, was leaving. ",95
36278,GEORGE," Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. ",95
36279,GEORGE,"  So you got a $25,000 a year raise.",95
36280,GEORGE, You're making more than I am.,95
36281,GEORGE, What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.,95
36282,ELAINE," Oh, this is insanity. I’m not this hippie. ",95
36283,ELAINE," Hey, what do you think of this?",95
36284,JERRY,"  Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?",95
36285,KRAMER, [Yeah] ,95
36286,JERRY, Kramer?,95
36287,KRAMER," Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes?",95

36290,JERRY, No.,95
36291,KRAMER, Well what are you doing here?,95
36292,JERRY, What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.,95
36293,KRAMER," Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants",95
36294,JERRY, Where are your pants?,95
36295,KRAMER," Well, I sold them to Bania.",95
36296,JERRY, What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.,95
36297,JERRY, Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?,95
36298,KRAMER, ouhhh -- I had Uma Therman’s number written on that stub. I lost Uma’s number.,95
36299,JERRY, Where are your clothes?,95
36300,KRAMER, I told you I sold them to Bania.,95
36301,JERRY, You mean what you were wearing?,95
36302,KRAMER, Yeah.,95
36303,JERRY, How'd you expect to get out of here?,95
36304,KRAMER," Well, I didn’t think ahead.",95
36305,ELAINE, This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.,95
36306,ELAINE, No?,95
36307,ELAINE, I am?,95
36308,ELAINE, Ha! That's preposterous.,95
36309,ELAINE," No. You can wrap it.  Kramer, are you still in there?",95
36310,JERRY, [Elaine],95
36311,ELAINE, Jerry?,95
36312,KRAMER, Bania?,95
36313,JERRY, I’m going out. ,95
36314,JERRY, Bania.,95
36315,KRAMER," Well you're not getting any money back.  Jerry, come back in here.",95
36316,JERRY,  Excuse me. ,95
36317,KRAMER, Uma’s number is on that ticket.,95
36318,JERRY," Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?",95
36319,KRAMER, I’m not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.,95
36320,JERRY, I got an idea.,95
36321,KRAMER, What?,95
36322,JERRY, I can’t believe I’m gonna do this. ,95
36323,JERRY, Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?,95
36324,JERRY," Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, I’m in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.",95
36325,JERRY," Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.",95
36326,JERRY," You want to go to Mendy’s, I’ll take you to Mendy’s.",95
36327,JERRY," all right let’s be reasonable, Bania. I’m taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.",95
36328,JERRY, . . . All right  Just give me the ticket.,95
36329,JERRY, Ohh ... ,95
36330,GEORGE," But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.",95
36331,JERRY," Let me in, it's me.  Here. You don't know what this is costing me. ",95
36332,KRAMER,"  All right, nice work.  Where's Uma’s number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.",95
36333,JERRY,  The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.,95
36334,KRAMER,  It must have been the botanical extracts.,95
36335,JERRY,  Give me that.,95
36336,JERRY," Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. ",95
36337,JERRY, The ticket is worthless.,95
36338,JERRY," Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat?",95
36339,JERRY, It is!  Give me that back.,95
36340,JERRY," You can’t have that coat, it's not yours.",95
36341,JERRY, What do you think the dry-cleaner’s is your own personal closet!,95
36342,ELAINE," Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?													",95
36343,ELAINE, ,95
36344,JERRY," Yeah, it's very good. ",95
36345,JERRY, Yeah. I’m having a wonderful time. ,95
36346,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.",95
36347,JERRY," Oh, and who might that be?",95
36348,JERRY," If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, I’m telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. I’m sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.",95
36349,JERRY,"The Christmas tree certainly seems to inspire a love/hate relationship. All that time is spent selecting it and decorating it, and then a week after it's just thrown somewhere, you see it by the side of the road, it looks like a mob hit. A car slows down, a door opens and this tree just rolls out. People snap out of that Christmas spirit like it was a drunken stupor, they just wake up one morning and go, ""Oh my god, there's a tree inside the house! Just throw it anywhere!",96
36350,JERRY, Ready to go Lois?,96
36351,JERRY, Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.,96
36352,JERRY, Duncan Meyers!,96
36353,JERRY," Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.",96
36354,ELAINE," No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?",96
36355,ELAINE, I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.,96
36356,ELAINE, What list?,96
36357,ELAINE," MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.",96
36358,GEORGE, Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?,96
36359,ELAINE, Ned must have left it here.,96
36360,GEORGE, Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?,96
36361,ELAINE," HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.",96
36362,GEORGE," Maybe he's just ""very well RED""?",96
36363,ELAINE, Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?,96
36364,GEORGE," Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?",96
36365,ELAINE," Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.",96
36366,GEORGE," Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. ""Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important."" . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.",96
36367,JERRY, Hi oh.,96
36368,ELAINE, Where's Lois?,96
36369,JERRY, She couldn't make it.,96
36370,GEORGE, I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.,96
36371,JERRY," I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.",96
36372,GEORGE, Duncan Meyers?,96
36373,ELAINE, Who's he?,96
36374,JERRY," Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.",96
36375,ELAINE, Uh uh,96
36376,JERRY," I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .",96
36377,ELAINE, What's that?,96
36378,JERRY," Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.",96
36379,ELAINE," Oh, of course.",96
36380,JERRY," He was down at the other end. So he yells out, ""Ready, On your mark, Get set, "" and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.",96
36381,ELAINE, No.,96
36382,GEORGE, I looked up. I couldn't believe it.,96
36383,JERRY, By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.,96
36384,ELAINE, Really?,96
36385,JERRY, And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.,96
36386,ELAINE, Well what happened when you raced him again?,96
36387,JERRY, I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.,96
36388,ELAINE, So now Duncan is back?,96
36389,JERRY, He's back. And I knew he would be someday.  Man that's some tart cider!,96
36390,JERRY, Hi.,96
36391,JERRY," Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?",96
36392,JERRY, He say anything?,96
36393,JERRY," Oh, nothing in particular.",96
36394,JERRY, I did not cheat.,96
36395,JERRY," Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.",96
36396,JERRY, Yes,96
36397,JERRY, Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.,96
36398,ELAINE," So how was work? Another day, another dollar?",96
36399,ELAINE, Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?,96
36400,ELAINE," OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything .",96
36401,ELAINE," Yeah, but come on . . .",96
36402,ELAINE," Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous.",96
36403,ELAINE," Well, so enjoy yourself.  ha ha uh ha",96
36404,GEORGE, So you lied to her?,96
36405,JERRY, I couldn’t tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that,96
36406,ELAINE," Well, I'm dating a communist.",96
36407,JERRY," Wow, a communist. That's something.",96
36408,ELAINE," Yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it?",96
36409,GEORGE," Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?",96
36410,JERRY, The Daily Worker has personal ads?,96
36411,GEORGE, And they say appearance is not important.,96
36412,JERRY, Yours or hers?,96
36413,KRAMER, Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.,96
36414,JERRY," Wow, look at you. So you got the job.",96
36415,KRAMER," Yeah, you're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department store.",96
36416,ELAINE," Oh, congratulations",96
36417,KRAMER," On Prancer on Dasher, on Donna.",96
36418,KRAMER, Donna!,96
36419,JERRY," Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye.",96
36420,GEORGE, What's up?,96
36421,JERRY, Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.,96
36422,GEORGE, He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.,96
36423,JERRY, That's not bad.,96
36424,GEORGE, Not bad? It's gorgeous!,96
36425,KRAMER," Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. Don't be shy.",96
36426,KRAMER, Santa speaks the language of all children. A notchie watchie dotchie do.,96
36427,KRAMER," A dotchie cotchie dochie,",96
36428,KRAMER," Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me.",96
36429,KRAMER, A sweat shop.,96
36430,KRAMER," Hey, hey, hey.",96
36431,GEORGE, Natalie?,96
36432,GEORGE, Thank you.,96
36433,GEORGE," Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system.",96
36434,ELAINE, Ilene.,96
36435,ELAINE, Hello.,96

36449,KRAMER, Talk to me baby.,96
36450,JERRY," I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?",96
36451,JERRY," Well, I . . . [sees George]",96
36452,GEORGE," Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!",96

36468,JERRY," yeah, yeah.",96
36469,GEORGE, I'm an architect.,96
36470,GEORGE, Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?,96
36471,GEORGE, Yep. And it didn't take very long either.,96

36481,GEORGE," Oh, the big race.",96
36482,JERRY, Yeah.,96
36483,GEORGE," Yes, yes,.",96

36492,JERRY, All right! I'll do it. The race is on.,96
36493,ELAINE, . . . shut up! ,96
36494,JERRY, And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus,96
36495,KRAMER," Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.",96
36496,KRAMER," Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.",96
36497,KRAMER, There are no delicatessens under Communism.,96
36498,KRAMER," Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.",96
36499,KRAMER," Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.",96
36500,GEORGE,"  . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right.

36502,JERRY," Hello, oh hi Duncan, 4",96
36503,ELAINE," Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?",96
36504,ELAINE, I'm going to order Chinese Food.,96
36505,ELAINE," Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.",96
36506,ELAINE, You're father was blacklisted?,96

36513,KRAMER, ho ho ho ho.,96
36514,KRAMER," You can't fire me, I'm Santa Claus.",96
36515,JERRY, Hi how are you?,96

36517,JERRY, What? He can't do that.,96
36518,JERRY, Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.,96
36519,GEORGE," You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?",96
36520,GEORGE," C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.",96
36521,GEORGE, Sir?,96
36522,GEORGE," Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best.",96
36523,KRAMER," Yeah,",96
36524,KRAMER," Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.",96
36525,KRAMER, I guess I screwed up!,96
36526,ELAINE, How do you feel?,96
36527,JERRY, I need a miracle.,96
36528,KRAMER, I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.,96

36565,KRAMER," Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal.",97
36566,GEORGE, And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.,97

36575,JERRY," Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.",97
36576,JERRY, Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.,97
36577,JERRY, I'm glad you enjoyed it.,97
36578,GEORGE," Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.",97
36579,GEORGE, Where you going?,97
36580,GEORGE, You're fresh  You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.,97
36581,JERRY, It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.,97
36582,ELAINE," See, what did I tell ya?",97
36583,JERRY," And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, ""That's funny."" ... That's funny!",97
36584,ELAINE," Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet.",97
36585,JERRY, I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!,97
36586,ELAINE," Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh.  This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad.",97
36587,GEORGE," Well, I heard a noise.",97
36588,JERRY, What noise?,97
36589,GEORGE," You know, .. blah ...",97
36590,JERRY, What blah?,97
36591,GEORGE, From the bathroom.,97
36592,JERRY," Oh, you think she was refunding?",97
36593,GEORGE, Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.,97
36594,ELAINE, So you're concerned.,97
36595,GEORGE," Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.",97
36596,JERRY, In a manner of speaking.,97
36597,GEORGE, Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.,97
36598,KRAMER, Here's your scrubber back.,97
36599,JERRY, Thanks.,97
36600,GEORGE," Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.",97
36601,JERRY, A matron?,97
36602,GEORGE, Yeah,97
36603,JERRY," uh, well I can't help you there .",97
36604,GEORGE, Wha?,97
36605,KRAMER, Nothin',97
36606,GEORGE, You know a matron?,97
36607,KRAMER, Me?,97
36608,GEORGE, You,97
36609,KRAMER, No.,97
36610,GEORGE," Kramer,",97
36611,KRAMER," Well, now look, just leave me alone.",97
36612,GEORGE," Well, what is it?",97
36613,KRAMER," No, don't, don't make me",97
36614,GEORGE, Wha?,97
36615,KRAMER," No, I can't, all right I can't ...",97
36616,GEORGE, Who?,97
36617,KRAMER, ... My mother's a matron!,97
36618,ELAINE, Babs?,97
36619,KRAMER," Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?",97
36620,GEORGE," Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.",97
36621,KRAMER," Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.",97
36622,GEORGE, Why not? Why not?,97
36623,KRAMER, let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.,97
36624,GEORGE," Come on, Kramer.",97
36625,KRAMER, I can't I can't,97
36626,JERRY, Kramer you're going to have to face her some time,97
36627,KRAMER,  b'd b'd,97
36628,ELAINE," Hello  Oh, my goodness. What happened?",97
36629,ELAINE, Oh,97
36630,ELAINE," Oh, you'll be playing ...",97
36631,ELAINE," There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,",97
36632,ELAINE, ... and biking and ..,97
36633,ELAINE, ... hiking ...,97
36634,ELAINE,  Could I ...,97
36635,ELAINE," , You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis",97
36636,KRAMER, Ma?,97
36637,GEORGE, Cosmo?,97
36638,JERRY, Why didn't you just ask her for it?,97
36639,ELAINE, I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again,97
36640,JERRY, Yeah,97
36641,GEORGE, Hey di ho,97
36642,JERRY, C'mon up.,97
36643,JERRY, So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?,97
36644,ELAINE," augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy",97
36645,JERRY, He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?,97
36646,ELAINE, He'll only play with his racquet,97
36647,JERRY," Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?",97
36648,ELAINE, That's stealing?,97
36649,JERRY, Stealing? You loaned her the racquet!,97
36650,ELAINE, I know.,97
36651,GEORGE, Hey oh.,97
36652,ELAINE, JERRY,97
36653,JERRY, So what happened with Kramer's mother?,97
36654,GEORGE, It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.,97
36655,JERRY, What's she like?,97
36656,GEORGE," Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.",97
36657,ELAINE," Ah, I'm ready what?",97
36658,JERRY, What is it?,97
36659,GEORGE, I uh got the first name.,97
36660,ELAINE, You found out Kramer's first name?,97
36661,GEORGE, That's right. You ready?,97
36662,JERRY, We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?,97
36663,GEORGE, Cosmo,97
36664,ELAINE, JERRY,97
36665,GEORGE, Cosmo,97
36666,ELAINE, JERRY,97
36667,ELAINE," Cosmo, Cosmo?",97
36668,KRAMER, What's so funny? ... wha?,97
36669,ELAINE, COSMO?,97
36670,KRAMER," All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.",97
36671,ELAINE, It's not such a bad name.,97
36672,KRAMER, Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!,97
36673,JERRY," Hi, is Sandy here?",97
36674,JERRY, I would except I forgot to bring a towel.,97
36675,JERRY, So the roommate laughed at everything I said.,97
36676,GEORGE, Wow.,97
36677,JERRY," It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse ""ha's."" You know those?",97
36678,GEORGE, Oh yeah,97
36679,JERRY, Yeah.,97
36680,GEORGE," Hate the big coarse ""ha."" Hate those.",97
36681,JERRY, And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.,97
36682,GEORGE, I see.,97
36683,JERRY," So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.",97
36684,GEORGE," Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.",97
36685,JERRY," Can't be done, huh?",97
36686,GEORGE, The Switch?,97
36687,JERRY," ""The Switch.""",97
36688,GEORGE, Can't be done.,97
36689,JERRY, I wonder.,97
36690,GEORGE, Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!,97
36691,JERRY, They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.,97
36692,GEORGE," Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.",97
36693,JERRY," The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?",97
36694,GEORGE," All right, dammit, I'm in.",97
36695,JERRY, I couldn't do it without you.,97
36696,GEORGE, All right. Let's get to work.,97
36697,GEORGE, All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.,97
36698,JERRY," Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!",97
36699,GEORGE, We'll come up with something.,97
36700,JERRY," Yeah, sure we will.",97
36701,GEORGE, All right. See you tomorrow. ,97
36702,GEORGE, I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!,97
36703,GEORGE," All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.",97
36704,JERRY, All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a ménage à trois with her and her roommate.,97
36705,GEORGE, That's right.,97
36706,JERRY," And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.",97
36707,GEORGE, Keep going.,97
36708,JERRY," At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.",97
36709,GEORGE, Continue.,97
36710,JERRY, The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.,97
36711,GEORGE," A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.",97
36712,JERRY," Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it",97
36713,GEORGE," You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, ""If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem.""",97
36714,JERRY, It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.,97
36715,GEORGE, This is what I do.,97
36716,ELAINE," Uh, no, I'm OK.",97
36717,ELAINE," Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it.",97
36718,ELAINE," No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.",97
36719,ELAINE, All right. I'm going I'm going,97
36720,ELAINE, Give it give it ..,97
36721,ELAINE, All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?,97
36722,KRAMER, Hi Mr. Clotworthy,97
36723,KRAMER, Ah couldn't be better. Hi Lorraine.,97
36724,KRAMER, My mom Babs.,97
36725,KRAMER," Yes, It's a fine day",97
36726,KRAMER," Hey, everything my man.",97
36727,JERRY," You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois.",97
36728,JERRY, Uh?,97
36729,KRAMER," You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.",97
36730,KRAMER, Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?,97
36731,KRAMER, I've got plenty of ideas.,97
36732,GEORGE, ... so glad.,97
36733,GEORGE, And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh,97
36734,GEORGE," Uh, yeah. Do you know Babs?",97
36735,GEORGE, Babs left?,97
36736,GEORGE, Ah Ha.,97
36737,GEORGE, I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.,97
36738,GEORGE, How 'ya feelin'?,97
36739,JERRY, Hey,97
36740,GEORGE, What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. The whole thing blew up in my face.,97
36741,JERRY," Ah, that's a shame.",97
36742,GEORGE," Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?",97
36743,JERRY," Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.",97
36744,GEORGE, So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?,97
36745,JERRY," No actually, she took it pretty well.",97
36746,GEORGE, So what happened?,97
36747,JERRY, She's into it.,97
36748,GEORGE, Into what?,97
36749,JERRY, The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.,97
36750,GEORGE, That's unbelievable.,97
36751,JERRY," Oh, it's a scene man.",97
36752,GEORGE, Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia?,97
36753,JERRY, What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.,97
36754,GEORGE," You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?",97
36755,JERRY, I can't. I'm not an orgy guy.,97
36756,GEORGE, Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.,97
36757,JERRY," Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.",97
36758,GEORGE, If only something like that could happen to me.,97
36759,JERRY," Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.",97
36760,GEORGE, I know.,97
36761,JERRY," Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?",97
36762,ELAINE," No, I got caught.",97
36763,JERRY, What do you mean you got caught?,97
36764,ELAINE, Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.,97
36765,JERRY, I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.,97
36766,ELAINE, Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.,97
36767,KRAMER, Hey.,97
36768,JERRY, Hi Cosmo.,97
36769,ELAINE, Hi Cosmo,97
36770,KRAMER, Thanks man.,97
36771,JERRY," Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?",97
36772,KRAMER," Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.",97
36773,JERRY," Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?",97
36774,KRAMER, Yeah,97
36775,JERRY, Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.,97
36776,KRAMER, All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's,97
36777,GEORGE," Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry.",97
36778,KRAMER, She quit.,97
36779,GEORGE, It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.,97
36780,KRAMER," Don't talk to me George, talk to her.",97
36781,GEORGE, Well where is she?,97
36782,KRAMER, I don't know.,97
36783,KRAMER, Ma!,97
36784,JERRY,  You sure you don't want the tickets?,98
36785,GEORGE,  No thanks.,98
36786,JERRY,  I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.,98
36787,GEORGE,"  I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.",98
36788,JERRY,"  I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.",98
36789,GEORGE,  Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?,98
36790,JERRY,  Maybe he didn't know?,98
36791,GEORGE,  Lemme see.  I can't believe you got these for free.   Row F?!,98
36792,JERRY,"  Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.",98
36793,GEORGE,"  Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?",98
36794,JERRY,"  I asked.  Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.",98
36795,GEORGE,  Wish I could help you.,98
36796,JERRY,"  Come on, take them.  You could take Bonnie.",98
36797,GEORGE,  You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?,98
36798,JERRY,  What do you think?,98
36799,GEORGE,"  So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars.  Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.",98
36800,JERRY,"  Yeah, sleeping arrangements.  So, you haven't, uh...",98
36801,GEORGE,"   Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet.  Tomorrow night's the first night.",98
36802,JERRY,  Aah.,98
36803,GEORGE,"  Hey, is that Tim Whatley?",98
36804,JERRY,  The Dentist?,98
36805,GEORGE,"  Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?",98
36806,JERRY,"  Oh, no.  I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.",98
36807,GEORGE,  Oh good.,98
36808,JERRY,"  Yeah, I blamed it on you.  Hi Tim.",98
36809,JERRY,"  Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.",98
36810,GEORGE,  I'm getting a makeover.,98
36811,JERRY,  Hey.  How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?,98
36812,JERRY,  Here.  Two tickets.  Have a good time.,98
36813,JERRY,  No no no.  No dinner.,98
36814,JERRY,"  Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift.  I know, it's a label maker.  The Label Baby Junior.  Yeah, I hear they're good.  Well, label me thankful.  Okay, well you enjoy those tickets.  Buh-bye.",98
36815,JERRY,  Come in.,98
36816,KRAMER,  Where can I put this?,98
36817,JERRY,  What is it?,98
36818,KRAMER,"  It's Risk, Jerry.  The game of world conquest.   Alright, that's perfect.",98
36819,JERRY,"  Kramer, why do you have to   Hello, Newman.",98
36820,JERRY,  Take what?,98
36821,KRAMER,"  The board, Jerry.  We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.",98
36822,JERRY,  So why don't you leave it at Newman's?,98
36823,KRAMER,  We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.,98
36824,JERRY,  So that's here?,98
36825,KRAMER,"  Yes, yes.  You're like Switzerland.",98
36826,JERRY,  I don't wanna be Switzerland.,98
36827,KRAMER,"  Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination.  It's winner take all.  People cannot be trusted.",98
36828,KRAMER,"  Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.",98
36829,JERRY,"  Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out.",98
36830,KRAMER,"  Alright, so you're gonna look after it?",98
36831,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah.",98
36832,KRAMER,  Stay strong buddy.,98
36833,JERRY,  Yeah.,98
36834,KRAMER, Watch it good.,98
36835,JERRY,  Ok.,98
36836,ELAINE,  Hey.,98
36837,JERRY,  Hey.,98
36838,ELAINE,"  Hey.  Oh, is that a label maker?",98
36839,JERRY,"  Yes it is.  I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.",98
36840,ELAINE,"  Love the Label Baby, baby.  You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.",98
36841,JERRY,  Tim Whatley?,98
36842,ELAINE,  Yeah.  Who sent you that one?,98
36843,JERRY,  One Tim Whatley!,98
36844,ELAINE,"  Not, my Tim Whatley?",98
36845,JERRY,"  The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.",98
36846,ELAINE,  I think this is the same one I gave him.  He recycled this gift.  He's a regifter!,98
36847,JERRY,"  Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing.  Perhaps it's an homage.",98
36848,ELAINE,"  Yeah, perhaps.",98
36849,JERRY,  Well how did he react when you gave it to him?,98
36850,ELAINE,"  Um, he said, ""Oh.  A label maker.  Howbout that?""",98
36851,JERRY,  He repeated the name of the gift?,98
36852,ELAINE,"  Yeah, so?",98
36853,JERRY,"  Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.",98
36854,ELAINE,  What do you mean?,98
36855,JERRY,"  Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, ""Oh. Tube socks.""  What are you gonna do about it?",98
36856,ELAINE,"  I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.",98
36857,JERRY,  Why'd you get him a gift anyway?,98
36858,ELAINE,"  Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.",98
36859,JERRY,"  Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.",98
36860,GEORGE,  Wow.,98
36861,GEORGE,"  I love it!  This is fantastic!  Look at this couch, is this velvet?!",98
36862,GEORGE,"  A fan?  I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!",98
36863,GEORGE,   Heh heh.,98
36864,GEORGE,"  So Scott's your roommate, huh?",98
36865,GEORGE,"  No, you didn't mention it.",98
36866,GEORGE,  I'm sure I will.,98
36867,JERRY,"  Male roommate, huh?",98
36868,GEORGE,  Yes.  A male roommate.,98
36869,JERRY,  Is this a problem?,98
36870,GEORGE,"  It's a huge problem, Jerry.  The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place!  He's already got that.",98
36871,JERRY,"  Well, maybe he's --",98
36872,GEORGE,"  No.  Believe me, he's not.",98
36873,JERRY,  So he's an eligible receiver.,98
36874,GEORGE,"  She's confiding in him about our dates.  You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date!  It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'",98
36875,JERRY,  What's stopping them?,98
36876,GEORGE,  Exactly!  You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.,98
36877,JERRY,  What does he look like?,98
36878,GEORGE,"  Oh, that's the worst part of it.  He looks just like me.",98
36879,JERRY,  He looks like you and he's working from the inside?,98
36880,GEORGE,  I look like me and I'm working from the outside.  Who do you think is in the better position?,98
36881,JERRY,  Not you.,98
36882,GEORGE,  Ho ho.  This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!,98
36883,JERRY,  We'll take a check please.,98
36884,GEORGE," I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment.  It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet.  You know, if it were socially acceptable--",98
36885,JERRY,"  I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.",98
36886,GEORGE,  I've said that before?,98
36887,JERRY,"  Many times.  You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.",98
36888,KRAMER,   Hey.,98
36889,GEORGE,  Hey.,98
36890,JERRY,  Hey.,98
36891,KRAMER,  Guess what?  I saw Newman talking to the super.,98
36892,JERRY,  So what?,98
36893,KRAMER,  The super has keys to your apartment.  Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.,98
36894,JERRY,"  Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.",98
36895,KRAMER,"  Yeah, alright, fine.  You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world.  But he'd be a horrible leader.  And you know who's gonna suffer?  The little people; you and George.",98
36896,JERRY,  Are you through?,98
36897,KRAMER,"  Oh.  I talked to Arthur Jobanian.  Yeah, the Drake's wedding?  That's off.",98
36898,JERRY,  The wedding is off?  What happened?,98
36899,KRAMER,"  The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl.  So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.",98
36900,GEORGE,  The wedding is off.  Now you can go to the Super Bowl.,98
36901,JERRY,  I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.,98
36902,GEORGE,"  You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.",98
36903,JERRY,  Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving?  There's no grace period.,98
36904,GEORGE,"  Well, didn't he regift the label maker?",98
36905,JERRY,  Possibly.,98
36906,GEORGE,"  Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?",98
36907,JERRY,  You may have a point.,98
36908,GEORGE,"  I have a point, I have a point.",98
36909,JERRY,"  Alright, I'll call him.",98
36910,GEORGE,  Yeah.  What's that?,98
36911,JERRY,"  Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives.   Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you?  Well it turns out I can use them.  Oh, you do?  I understand.  Okay.  Bye.  He already made plans, he can't change them.",98
36912,GEORGE,"   Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.",98
36913,JERRY,  Thanks.,98
36914,GEORGE,"  Alright, I gotta go.  I'm heading over to Bonnie's.",98
36915,JERRY,  What are you gonna do about the roommate?,98
36916,GEORGE,  I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him.  It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.,98
36917,JERRY,"  Well, the pickle breath is a good start.",98
36918,JERRY,  What do you want?,98
36919,JERRY,"  I'm not letting you cheat, Newman.  You're not getting anywhere near that board.",98
36920,JERRY,"  You're not a little anything, Newman.  So just pack it up and move it out of here.",98
36921,JERRY,"  I dunno, watch it on TV I guess.  Why?",98
36922,JERRY,  You're going to the Super Bowl?,98
36923,JERRY,  What's his name?,98
36924,JERRY,  That's my ticket!,98
36925,JERRY,   Newman!,98
36926,GEORGE,  What a movie.  Good choice.,98
36927,GEORGE,"  Oh, Scott, Scott.  He's really great, isn't he?",98
36928,GEORGE,"  Yes he is.  Let me ask you something.  When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?",98
36929,GEORGE,"  Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?",98
36930,GEORGE,  What's the massage situation?,98
36931,GEORGE,"  Is there any work being done?  Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?",98
36932,GEORGE,"  Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit?  I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?",98
36933,GEORGE,"  I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate!  It's unnatural, it's an abomination!",98
36934,GEORGE,  Hey!,98
36935,GEORGE,  I'm good.,98
36936,ELAINE,  Yes it is.,98
36937,ELAINE,  Yeah.,98
36938,ELAINE,  Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?,98
36939,ELAINE,  I would love to go upstairs.,98
36940,ELAINE,  We'll see.,98
36941,JERRY,  Newman.  He's going with Newman.,98
36942,GEORGE,  How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?,98
36943,JERRY,  Newman's his mailman.,98
36944,GEORGE,  Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!,98
36945,JERRY,  Who goes *anywhere* with Newman?!,98
36946,GEORGE,"  Well, he's merry.",98
36947,JERRY,"  He is merry, I'll give him that.   What's this plant for?",98
36948,GEORGE,  I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.,98
36949,JERRY,"  Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.",98
36950,ELAINE,"  Hey, guess what?  I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.",98
36951,JERRY,  What?,98
36952,ELAINE,  We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.,98
36953,JERRY,  What about the label maker?,98
36954,ELAINE,"  Ah, well.",98
36955,JERRY,"  Wait a minute, that's my ticket!  You didn't even want to go.",98
36956,ELAINE,"  It was totally out of the blue.  We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.",98
36957,JERRY,"  So, how did you get up there?  Did you say you had to use the bathroom?",98
36958,ELAINE,  No.,98
36959,JERRY,  Then how'd you get up there?,98
36960,ELAINE,"  I said, ""Do you wanna go upstairs?""",98
36961,GEORGE,  And there's you ticket.,98
36962,ELAINE,  What?,98
36963,JERRY,  That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.,98
36964,ELAINE,  Why?,98
36965,JERRY,"  You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West?  Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.",98
36966,ELAINE,"  You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?",98
36967,JERRY,  Obviously.,98
36968,ELAINE,  You're crazy.,98
36969,GEORGE,"  Well, what happened when you got upstairs?",98
36970,ELAINE,"  As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave.  I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.",98
36971,JERRY,"  Yeah, well I don't trust this guy.  I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.",98
36972,KRAMER,  Hey.,98
36973,JERRY,  Hey.  What are you doing?,98
36974,KRAMER,  I'm watching your door.,98
36975,JERRY,  My door?,98
36976,KRAMER,"   Yeah, from my peephole.  Fisheye, sees all.",98
36977,JERRY,   What was that?,98
36978,KRAMER,  Newman!,98
36979,JERRY,   The bedroom!,98
36980,JERRY,"  I see you, Newman!  I see you!",98
36981,KRAMER,  I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!,98
36982,ELAINE,  I've got a confession to make.,98
36983,ELAINE,  I've got Super Bowl fever.,98
36984,ELAINE,  So where are we staying?,98
36985,ELAINE,  Oh.  Big room?,98
36986,ELAINE,  Downtown?,98
36987,ELAINE,"  What do they have there, a couple of beds?",98
36988,ELAINE,"  No, but don't you think there should be two beds?  There's two of us.",98
36989,GEORGE,"  They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.",98
36990,GEORGE,  Oh.  Oh!,98
36991,JERRY,  So she kicked him out of the apartment.,98
36992,GEORGE,  That's right.  It's just me and her.,98
36993,JERRY,"  Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.",98
36994,GEORGE,"  I guess she did.  He's gone, now I'm the man.",98
36995,JERRY,  That's not a good role for you.,98
36996,GEORGE,"  No, it's not.",98
36997,JERRY,  You unwittingly made a major commitment.  That's a lot of pressure.,98
36998,GEORGE,  Oh my god.,98
36999,JERRY,"  You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.",98
37000,GEORGE,"  I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.",98
37001,JERRY,  He was shouldering.,98
37002,GEORGE,   I couldn't leave well enough alone?!,98
37003,JERRY,  Where are you going?,98
37004,GEORGE,  I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.,98
37005,JERRY,"  Oh, well here.  Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.",98
37006,GEORGE,  Thanks.,98
37007,KRAMER,  Yeah.  I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.,98
37008,JERRY,"  So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?",98
37009,JERRY,"   Thanks for having me over, guys.",98
37010,JERRY,"  Alright, I'll see you later.",98
37011,JERRY,"  Ah, Tim Whatley.  Out scalping?",98
37012,JERRY,"  Are you serious, what about Elaine?",98
37013,JERRY,"  Oh.    Hey, isn't this Kramer's car?   Hey, Cosmo!!  They're towing your car!!",98
37014,KRAMER,   What?!  Not my car!!  Hey!!  They're towing my car!!,98
37015,KRAMER,  I'm taking the board with me.,98
37016,JERRY,"  Yeah, see you there.",98
37017,GEORGE,"  What, what happened?  Where's, where's all the stuff?",98
37018,GEORGE,"  The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?",98
37019,KRAMER,"  Oh, stop stalling.  Come on.",98
37020,KRAMER,  Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland?  I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.,98
37021,KRAMER,"  Ha ha, the Ukraine.  Do you know what the Ukraine is?  It's a sitting duck.  A road apple, Newman.  The Ukraine is weak.  It's feeble.  I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.",98
37022,KRAMER,"  Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.",98
37023,ELAINE,"  Hello, Tim.",98
37024,ELAINE,"  Don't worry, Tim.  I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all.  I just came by to pick up my label maker.  I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.",98
37025,ELAINE,"  But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl.  Hand it over, Whatley.",98
37026,ELAINE,"  You don't have the label maker, do you?",98
37027,ELAINE,  I knew it!  You're a regifter!,98
37028,ELAINE,  What?,98
37029,ELAINE,"   Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work.  The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.",98
37030,JERRY,"  H... G... F.  Seat four.  One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.",98
37031,JERRY,"  Oh, it's enchanting.",98
37032,GEORGE,"  Here's the TV.  I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl.  Do you at least have some towels we could sit on?  It's, like, a four hour game.",98
37033,GEORGE,"   How am I gonna get out of this?  Think Costanza, think!",98
37034,GEORGE,"  Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.",98
37035,GEORGE,"  Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Ménage à Trois?",98
37036,JERRY,  Can you move over at all?!,98
37037,JERRY,  An inch!  Can you move over an inch?!?,98
37038,JERRY,"The big new accessory with eyeglasses, seems to be that strap, that connects in the back so you can take 'em on and off. Which I don't get, because I thought, if you have glasses, isn't that because you need to wear glasses? 'You need glasses', isn't that what they say? I mean, an eye doctor doesn't say 'Would you care for some glasses?' When people have crutches, they don't have like a little chain attached to their belt, so they can just let go of 'em every now and then. Why not get a toupee with a rubber band for when you're water-skiing, the thing could just... ",99
37039,GEORGE," Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.",99
37040,GEORGE," Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?",99
37041,KRAMER,  Hey pig!,99
37042,JERRY, So you called the cop a pig?,99
37043,KRAMER, I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.,99
37044,JERRY, Didn't you explain that to the cop?,99
37045,KRAMER," No, I fled the scene.",99
37046,JERRY,  Hey.,99
37047,KRAMER,  Hey buddy.,99
37048,GEORGE," Hey, uh...",99
37049,KRAMER, What?,99
37050,GEORGE," Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.",99
37051,KRAMER, Oh. What about?,99
37052,GEORGE, Kramer...,99
37053,KRAMER," Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?",99
37054,GEORGE," Hey, you're hurting me!",99
37055,KRAMER," You gonna share it with me next time, huh?",99
37056,GEORGE," I swear, I swear!",99
37057,KRAMER," Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.",99
37058,GEORGE," Right, I got news. You ready?  Gary Fogel had cancer.",99
37059,JERRY," Oh yeah, I knew.",99
37060,GEORGE, You knew? How did you know?,99
37061,JERRY, He told me a few months ago.,99
37062,GEORGE, Why did he tell you and not me?,99
37063,JERRY, I don't know.,99
37064,GEORGE, How are you closer to him than me?,99
37065,GEORGE," So, is he okay?",99
37066,JERRY," Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.",99
37067,GEORGE," Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?",99
37068,JERRY," No, he was on his regular bed.",99
37069,GEORGE, So why didn't you tell me?,99
37070,JERRY, He swore me to secrecy.,99
37071,GEORGE, So?,99
37072,JERRY, It's not like you're my wife.,99
37073,GEORGE," Well, I still think you shoulda told me.",99
37074,JERRY," Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.",99
37075,GEORGE," Well, I wanna talk to him about this.",99
37076,JERRY," That's right, you let him have it.",99
37077,GEORGE, Mmm-mm.,99
37078,JERRY, Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?,99
37079,GEORGE, That's what I'm saying.,99
37080,JERRY, His illness is your business.,99
37081,GEORGE," If not mine, whose?",99
37082,JERRY," If not now, when?",99
37083,ELAINE, Were you just talking about me?,99
37084,GEORGE," No, an old friend of ours, Gary.",99
37085,ELAINE," Oh, the guy with cancer?",99
37086,GEORGE,  You told her? She's not your wife!,99
37087,JERRY," If I told you, you woulda given it away.",99
37088,GEORGE, You don't think I can keep a secret?,99
37089,JERRY," No, but he would've read your face.",99
37090,GEORGE, You don't trust my poker face?,99
37091,JERRY, Do you ever win at poker?,99
37092,GEORGE,  No.,99
37093,KRAMER," Hey.  Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.",99
37094,ELAINE," Egh, Jake Jarmel?",99
37095,KRAMER, Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.,99
37096,ELAINE, Why? You don't wear glasses.,99
37097,KRAMER," I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.",99
37098,GEORGE," I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.",99
37099,KRAMER," Yeah, I've considered that.  Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?",99
37100,ELAINE," Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.",99
37101,KRAMER, Ah.,99
37102,ELAINE," You know, we had a really bad break-up.",99
37103,JERRY, The Jujy Fruits?,99
37104,ELAINE,"  Yeah, the Jujy Fruits.",99
37105,KRAMER," Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?",99
37106,KRAMER, So you don't know where you got 'em?,99
37107,KRAMER," Well, that's peculiar. ",99
37108,GEORGE," Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.",99
37109,GEORGE," Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.",99
37110,GEORGE,"  Really?  You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.",99
37111,GEORGE, Well I still think it was wrong.,99
37112,GEORGE,  Yes.,99
37113,KRAMER," ...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.",99
37114,KRAMER, Scared of being shot.,99
37115,KRAMER, I like that eye patch.,99
37116,GEORGE,"  All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.",99
37117,GEORGE," Wha, that's a Kinney lot?",99
37118,GEORGE," Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.",99
37119,GEORGE, You still owe me a secret.,99
37120,GEORGE, Yeah?,99
37121,GEORGE, What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.,99
37122,GEORGE, Just one? I'm living like twenty.  What's yours?,99
37123,ELAINE, So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?,99
37124,KRAMER,  Flat out refused! ,99
37125,ELAINE," Yeah, isn't that just like him?  You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.",99
37126,KRAMER," Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister.  Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.",99
37127,ELAINE, What?  You told Jake I said hi?,99
37128,KRAMER, Yeah.,99
37129,ELAINE, I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi!  When did I say hi?,99
37130,JERRY, I never heard her say hi.,99
37131,KRAMER," Well, it's uh, common courtesy.",99
37132,ELAINE," No, no.  Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.",99
37133,JERRY, It's like a game of tag.,99
37134,JERRY, Where you going?,99
37135,ELAINE, Nowhere.,99
37136,JERRY," You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?",99
37137,ELAINE, So what if I do? ,99
37138,KRAMER,"  Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there,  maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses.  Elaine!",99
37139,JERRY, Hey. How'd it go with Gary?,99
37140,GEORGE,"  Fine, fine. ",99
37141,JERRY,  Really?,99
37142,GEORGE,  Yeah.,99
37143,JERRY, You look like something's on your mind.,99
37144,GEORGE, No. Nothing. Fine. ,99
37145,JERRY," So, that's your poker face.",99
37146,GEORGE, My regular face.,99
37147,JERRY, No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.,99
37148,GEORGE, What are you saying?,99
37149,JERRY," All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? ",99
37150,GEORGE, I got nothing.,99
37151,JERRY," What you got, a pair of bullets?",99
37152,GEORGE, What you talking about?,99
37153,JERRY, Two pair? Three of a kind?,99
37154,GEORGE, Will you stop it?,99
37155,JERRY," Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!",99
37156,GEORGE, I don't have a flush.,99
37157,JERRY," A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling!  What d'you got!",99
37158,GEORGE,  Gary Fogel never had cancer!,99
37159,ELAINE," So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.",99
37160,ELAINE, That's what I'm saying.,99
37161,ELAINE, Correct.,99
37162,ELAINE, Correct.,99
37163,ELAINE, Correct.  What's that?,99
37164,ELAINE,"  How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?",99
37165,ELAINE," Ah, Jake...  I, uh...",99
37166,GEORGE," The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.",99
37167,JERRY, So what was wrong with him?,99
37168,GEORGE, Nothing!,99
37169,JERRY, So he's been lying to me for two months?!,99
37170,GEORGE, That's right.,99
37171,JERRY," What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.",99
37172,GEORGE, Well...,99
37173,JERRY, I don't even think you could do it.,99
37174,GEORGE," Oh, I could do it.",99
37175,JERRY," Yeah, I guess you could.",99
37176,GEORGE,  C'mon.,99
37177,JERRY," Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?",99
37178,GEORGE, You did that?,99
37179,JERRY," Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. ",99
37180,GEORGE," Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. ",99
37181,JERRY, Why not?,99
37182,GEORGE,"  Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.",99
37183,JERRY," So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?",99
37184,GEORGE, Yeah.,99
37185,JERRY," Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.",99
37186,GEORGE," Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.",99
37187,JERRY, Why didn't he tell me?,99
37188,GEORGE, Because you were being so nice.,99
37189,JERRY, I don't think I can be that nice.,99
37190,GEORGE,  You be nice!,99
37191,JERRY, Gary?,99
37192,JERRY, Is that from my gift certificate?,99
37193,JERRY,"  Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.",99
37194,JERRY, I don't think so.,99
37195,JERRY, Okay. ,99
37196,KRAMER,  Hey buddy.,99
37197,JERRY, Hey. Look at you. Wha... what's this?,99
37198,KRAMER, It's an eyepatch.,99
37199,JERRY, You look like a pirate.,99
37200,KRAMER, I wanna be a pirate.,99
37201,JERRY,  This is Gary.,99
37202,KRAMER,  How you doing?,99
37203,KRAMER," Well, I tell you there's only one problem.",99
37204,JERRY, Can't see on your right side?,99
37205,KRAMER," No. It's uh,  it's itchy",99
37206,GEORGE, Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.,99
37207,GEORGE," Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.",99
37208,GEORGE, You didn't?,99
37209,GEORGE, Regards?,99
37210,ELAINE," Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?",99
37211,ELAINE,"  Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car.  Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.",99
37212,ELAINE,"  'Scuse me! 'Scuse me.  Excuse me, sir. Sir?",99
37213,ELAINE," Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?",99
37214,ELAINE, Malaysia?,99
37215,ELAINE," Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?",99
37216,ELAINE,  Oh! ,99
37217,ELAINE, C'mon.,99
37218,ELAINE, Let's start the bidding.,99
37219,GEORGE," So, you didn't think this was a date?",99
37220,GEORGE, I thought it was a date.,99
37221,GEORGE, What about the regards?,99
37222,GEORGE," No, tell me.",99
37223,GEORGE, Me? Oh yeah.,99
37224,GEORGE," Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.",99
37225,JERRY," Hey, do you know what the Whip does?",99
37226,KRAMER, What whip?,99
37227,JERRY," The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.",99
37228,KRAMER," Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them.  You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. ",99
37229,GEORGE,"  Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.",99
37230,KRAMER,  Newman! The white whale!,99
37231,GEORGE, Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?,99
37232,JERRY, Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?,99
37233,GEORGE, No. Definitely not.,99
37234,JERRY, Yeah.,99
37235,GEORGE, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.,99
37236,JERRY, And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.,99
37237,GEORGE, The one who always sits by herself?,99
37238,JERRY, Yeah!,99
37239,GEORGE, How did he do that?,99
37240,JERRY, Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.,99
37241,GEORGE, Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!,99
37242,JERRY," She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?",99
37243,GEORGE,  He picked her up?,99
37244,JERRY, Walked right over to her table.,99
37245,GEORGE, Wow. ,99
37246,ELAINE," Jake, Jake. Take a look.  Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.",99
37247,ELAINE, Malaysia. I was in the area.,99
37248,KRAMER, Just drive.,99
37249,KRAMER," All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.",99
37250,KRAMER,"  Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.",99
37251,KRAMER," You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.",99
37252,KRAMER," Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?",99
37253,KRAMER, So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?,99
37254,KRAMER," All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.",99
37255,GEORGE, I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.,99
37256,JERRY," You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.",99
37257,GEORGE," Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.",99
37258,JERRY, What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?,99
37259,GEORGE," The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.",99
37260,JERRY," So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out  'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'.  Aahh!",99
37261,ELAINE," Oh, Mr Lippman.  That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.",99
37262,ELAINE," Oh really, you like 'em?",99
37263,ELAINE," Well, you know what? ",99
37264,ELAINE,  You can have 'em.,99
37265,ELAINE," No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.",99
37266,ELAINE," Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.",99
37267,ELAINE, They're from Malaysia.,99
37268,ELAINE,  Fabulous.,99
37269,KRAMER," Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.",99
37270,GEORGE,"  Well, what d'you think?",99
37271,JERRY,"  I, really can't say.",99
37272,GEORGE," No, say. I want you to say.",99
37273,JERRY," It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look  stupid.  I'm sorry.",99
37274,GEORGE,  I really think this looks pretty good.,99
37275,JERRY," Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?",99
37276,GEORGE,"  Well, maybe you could show me something else.",99
37277,JERRY," Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!",99
37278,JERRY," Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!",99
37279,JERRY, All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.,99
37280,GEORGE,  Jerry!,99
37281,JERRY, I'm sorry.,99
37282,GEORGE, Please. ,99
37283,GEORGE," Well, I'm, I'm just looking.",99
37284,GEORGE, What?,99
37285,JERRY, What?,99
37286,JERRY," You know, Gary  I had a little chat with George the other day...",99
37287,GEORGE,  I did.,99
37288,JERRY,  ...and he told me that that... ,99
37289,JERRY, Gimme that thing!,99
37290,GEORGE, How's your life? All right?,99
37291,ELAINE,  'Scuse me. Have to go  look for some socks.,99
