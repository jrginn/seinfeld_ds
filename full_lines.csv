0,JERRY," Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why we’re here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about “We should go out”? This is what they’re talking about...this whole thing, we’re all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we’re all out! There are people tryin’ to find us, they don’t know where we are.  “Did you ring?, I can’t find him.” “Where did he go?” “He didn’t tell me where he was going”. He must have gone out. You wanna go out",1
1,JERRY,"  See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. It’s too high! It’s in no-man’s-land. You look like you live with your mother.",1
2,GEORGE, Are you through? ,1
3,JERRY," You do of course try on, when you buy?",1
4,GEORGE," Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don’t actually recall considering the buttons.",1
5,JERRY," Oh, you don’t recall?",1
6,GEORGE,"  Uh, no, not at this time.",1
7,JERRY," Well, senator, I’d just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.",1
8,CLAIRE, Mr. Seinfeld. Mr. Costanza. ,1
9,GEORGE," Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where’s the orange indicator?",1
10,CLAIRE," It’s missing, I have to do it in my head",1
11,JERRY," Can you relax, it’s a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.",1
12,CLAIRE, Trust me George. No one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine.,1
13,GEORGE, How come you’re not doin’ the second show tomorrow?,1
14,JERRY," Well, there’s this uh, woman might be comin’ in.",1
15,GEORGE," Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?",1
16,JERRY," I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?",1
17,GEORGE," No, you didn’t!",1
18,JERRY," I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing... ",1
19,GEORGE, Ha.,1
20,JERRY,"  There’s no milk in here, what...",1
21,GEORGE," Wait wait wait, what is she...  What is she like?",1
22,JERRY," Oh, she’s really great. I mean, she’s got like a real warmth about her and she’s really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.",1
23,GEORGE,"  So, you know, what, what happened?",1
24,JERRY," Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.",1
25,GEORGE," Oh, nothing happened, but it was...",1
26,JERRY, Yeah.,1
27,GEORGE, This is great!,1
28,JERRY, Yeah.,1
29,GEORGE," So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!",1
30,JERRY," Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we’ll get together. ",1
31,GEORGE,"  Ho ho ho, ‘Had to’? ‘Had to’ come in?",1
32,JERRY," Yeah, but...",1
33,GEORGE, ‘Had to come in’ and ‘maybe we’ll get together’? ‘Had to’ and ‘maybe’?,1
34,JERRY, Yeah!,1
35,GEORGE," No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. You’re not gonna see this woman.",1
36,JERRY," What, are you serious...why, why did she call?",1
37,GEORGE," How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite. ",1
38,JERRY, To be polite? You are insane!,1
39,GEORGE," All right, all right, I didn’t want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?",1
40,JERRY, Yes!,1
41,GEORGE," You’re a back-up, you’re a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!",1
42,JERRY," Oh, I get it, this is about the button.",1
43,GEORGE," Claire, Claire, you’re a woman, right?",1
44,CLAIRE," What gave it away, George?",1
45,GEORGE," Uhm...I’d like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.",1
46,GEORGE,"  Now, a woman calls me, all right? ",1
47,CLAIE, Uh huh.,1
48,GEORGE, She says she ‘has to’ come to New York on business...,1
49,JERRY, Oh you are beautiful!,1
50,GEORGE," ...and, and ‘maybe’ she’ll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?",1
51,CLAIRE," I’d have to say, uuhh, no. ",1
52,CLAIRE, To be polite.,1
53,GEORGE, To be polite. I rest my case.,1
54,JERRY," Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you’re talking about, now, come on, come with me.  I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.",1
55,GEORGE, I’m not gonna watch you do laundry.,1
56,JERRY," Oh, come on, be a come-with guy.",1
57,GEORGE," Come on, I’m tired.",1
58,CLAIRE,"  Don’t worry, I gave him a little caffeine. He’ll perk up.",1
59,GEORGE,"  Right, I knew I felt something!",1
60,GEORGE, Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment I’ve ever experienced. ,1
61,JERRY," Well, look at this guy. Look, he’s got everything, he’s got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.",1
62,GEORGE," I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...",1
63,JERRY, And you didn’t even hear how she sounded.,1
64,GEORGE, What?!,1
65,JERRY, Laura.,1
66,GEORGE, I can’t believe-  WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!,1
67,JERRY," Yeah, but how could you be so sure?",1
68,GEORGE," ‘Cause it’s signals, Jerry, it’s signals!  Don’t you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin’ tomorrow night, if you were busy?",1
69,JERRY, No.,1
70,GEORGE, She calls you today and she doesn’t make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It’s Saturday night!,1
71,JERRY, Yeah.,1
72,GEORGE," What is that? It’s ridiculous! You don’t even know what hotel she’s staying at, you can’t call her. That’s a signal, Jerry, that’s a signal!  Signal!",1
73,JERRY, Maybe you’re right.,1
74,GEORGE, Maybe I’m right? Of course I’m right.,1
75,JERRY," This is insane. You know, I don’t even know where she’s staying! She, she’s not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.",1
76,GEORGE," I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why don’t you just see if it’s dry?",1
77,JERRY," No no no, don’t interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it’s doing. Just let it finish.",1
78,GEORGE, You’re gonna overdry it.,1
79,JERRY," You, you can’t overdry.",1
80,GEORGE, Why not?,1
81,JERRY," Same as you can’t overwet. You see, once something is wet, it’s wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die you’re dead, right? Let’s say you drop dead and I shoot you. You’re not gonna die again, you’re already dead. You can’t overdie, you can’t overdry.",1
82,GEORGE,  Any questions?,1
83,JERRY, How could she not tell me where she was staying? ,1
84,GEORGE, Look at that. They’re done! ,1
85,JERRY," Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...y’know, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, it’s dark, there’s bubbles happening, they’re all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, “C’mon babe, let’s go”. You come by, you open up the lid and they’ll-  Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they’re in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, “Tomorrow, the dryer, I’m goin’. You wait here!” The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you don’t see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So they’re showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isn’t your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first. ",1
86,JERRY,"  If you know what happened in the Met game, don’t say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, I’m sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no ",1
87,JERRY,  Yeah?,1
88,KESSLER, Are you up?,1
89,JERRY,"  Yeah.  Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.",1
90,KESSLER," Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh? ",1
91,JERRY,"  Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, it’s a tape! I taped the game, it’s one o’clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.",1
92,KESSLER," Hey, I’m sorry, I- you know, I, I thought you knew.  You got any meat?",1
93,JERRY," Meat? I don’t, I don’t know, go... hunt!  Well what happened in the game anyway?",1
94,KESSLER,"  What happened? Well, they STUNK, that’s what happened!",1
95,KESSLER," You know, I almost wound up going to that game.",1
96,JERRY,  Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven’t been out of the building in ten years!,1
97,KESSLER, Yeah.  Are you done with this?,1
98,JERRY, No.,1
99,KESSLER," When you’re done, let me know.",1
100,JERRY," Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.",1
101,KESSLER, I thought I wasn’t allowed to be in here this weekend.,1
102,JERRY," No, it’s okay now, that, that girl is not comin’. Uh, I misread the whole thing.",1
103,KESSLER, You want me to talk to her?,1
104,JERRY, I don’t think so.,1
105,KESSLER," Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer.",1
106,JERRY," That close, huh?",1
107,KESSLER, You better believe it.,1
108,JERRY," Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.",1
109,KESSLER," Oh, give me it...let me talk to her.",1
110,JERRY,"  No believe me, I’m always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...",1
111,KESSLER,  SLIDE! Wow!,1
112,JERRY," No, it’s, it’s just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it.  Ten-fifteen... No, don’t be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, it’s no trouble at all... I’ll see you tomorrow... Great, bye.  I don’t believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here! ",1
113,JERRY," If my father was moving this he’d had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way.  'Have you got your end?...Your end’s got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end’s got to come down.'",1
114,GEORGE," You know, I can’t believe you’re bringin’ in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why don’t you bring in an extra guy too?",1
115,JERRY," Look, it’s a very awkward situation. I don’t wanna be presumptuous.",1
116,GEORGE," All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?",1
117,JERRY," All right, she said she couldn’t find a decent hotel room...",1
118,GEORGE, A decent hotel-room...,1
119,JERRY," Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.",1
120,GEORGE," You can’t be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag?  This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal! ",1
121,JERRY,"  This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?",1
122,GEORGE, I think I was affected by the caffeine. ,1
123,GEORGE," Ho, ho, ho, good dog, good dog...",1
124,KESSLER," Hey, he really likes you, George.",1
125,GEORGE," Well, that’s flattering. ",1
126,KESSLER," Oh, he’s gettin’ a drink of water.  Is this for that girl?",1
127,JERRY, Yeah.,1
128,KESSLER, Why even give her an option?,1
129,JERRY," This is a person I like, it’s not “How to score on spring break”.",1
130,GEORGE," Right, can we go? ‘Cause I’m double-parked, I’m gonna get a ticket.",1
131,JERRY," Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.",1
132,GEORGE, So what? That’s good.,1
133,JERRY," Now, how could that be good?",1
134,GEORGE," Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin’ around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin’ over, “I’ve gotta tidy up?” Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.",1
135,JERRY, This is how you operate?,1
136,GEORGE," Yeah, I wish.",1
137,JERRY, Let me just wipe the sink.,1
138,KESSLER, Why even give her an option for? ,1
139,KESSLER,  It’s unbelievable.,1
140,GEORGE, Yeah.,1
141,KESSLER, How’s the real estate-business?,1
142,GEORGE,"  It’s uh, not bad, it’s comin’ along. Why? Did you need something.",1
143,KRAMER, Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?,1
144,GEORGE," Well, I might be getting into that.",1
145,KESSLER,  You keep me posted!,1
146,GEORGE," I’m aware of you.  All right, let’s go  Let’s go!",1
147,JERRY," The dating world is not a fun world...it’s a pressure world, it’s a world of tension, it’s a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, ‘cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don’t know what they need. I know I don’t have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I’m- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we’re all human beings, what is the story? I’ve never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I’ve never been in a situation, when I thought to myself",1
148,JERRY, Wouldn’t it be great if you could ask a woman what she’s thinking?,1
149,GEORGE," What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she’s thinkin’.",1
150,JERRY," You know, instead, I’m like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.",1
151,GEORGE," Listen, listen, don’t get worked up, ‘cause you’re gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.",1
152,JERRY, Really? How?,1
153,GEORGE, ‘Cause it’s all in the greeting. ,1
154,JERRY, Uh-huh.,1
155,GEORGE," All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that’s a good sign.",1
156,JERRY, Right.,1
157,GEORGE," You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.",1
158,JERRY, Lip area.,1
159,GEORGE, You know a hug,1
160,JERRY, Hug is definitely good.,1
161,GEORGE, Sure.,1
162,JERRY," Although what if it’s one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?",1
163,GEORGE," That’s so brutal, I hate that.",1
164,JERRY, You know how they do that?,1
165,GEORGE," That’s why, you know, a shake is bad.",1
166,JERRY," Shake is bad, but what if it’s the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?",1
167,GEORGE, Hand sandwich.,1
168,JERRY, Right.,1
169,GEORGE," I see, well, that’s open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes. ",1
170,LAURA, Guess who?,1
171,JERRY," Hey, hey.",1
172,JERRY, It’s good to see you.,1
173,LAURA, Hi.,1
174,JERRY, This is my friend George.,1
175,LAURA," Hi, how nice to meet you.",1
176,GEORGE," Hi, how are you?",1
177,JERRY, This is Laura.,1
178,GEORGE," Laura, sure.",1
179,JERRY,  I can’t believe you’re here.,1
180,LAURA," Oh, thank you.",1
181,JERRY,"  Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?",1
182,GEORGE," Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasn’t in the manual, I don’t know.",1
183,JERRY," So uh, what do you think?",1
184,LAURA," Ooohhh, wow! This place isn’t so bad.",1
185,JERRY," Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home.  So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?",1
186,LAURA,"  Actually, um, do you have any wine?",1
187,JERRY," Uh, yeah, I think I do.",1
188,LAURA,"  Oh, do you mind if I turn this down?",1
189,JERRY," Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead.",1
190,LAURA," Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering, would it be possible – and if it’s not, fine – for me to stay here tomorrow night too?",1
191,JERRY," Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don’t you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin’ anything?",1
192,LAURA," No, I’d love to do something. Uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that I’m right open.",1
193,JERRY, Really? What would you like to do?,1
194,LAURA," Well... now I know this sounds touristy, but I’d just love to go on one of those five-hour boat rides around Manhattan.",1
195,JERRY,"  Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not.  I’m just, I’m really glad you’re here.",1
196,JERRY,"  Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on.  Um, it’s for you.",1
197,LAURA,"  Hello?... Hi!... No no it was great, right on time... No, I, I’m gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it’s fine... No, we’re goin’ on a boat ride... Don’t be silly... I’m not gonna have this conversation... Look, I’ll call you tomorrow... Okay, bye.  Never get engaged.",1
198,JERRY,  You’re engaged?,1
199,LAURA," You, you really have no idea what it’s like until you actually do it. And I’m on this emotional roller coaster.",1
200,JERRY, You’re engaged? ,1
201,LAURA," You know, I can’t believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of “we”. Ugh, it’s a very stressful situation.",1
202,JERRY,  You’re engaged. ,1
203,LAURA," Yeah, yeah, he’s a great guy...",1
204,JERRY, Yeah.,1
205,LAURA," You’d really like him, you know, I can’t wait to get on that boat.",1
206,JERRY, Me too!,1
207,JERRY," I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don’t get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, I’m not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they’re so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that’s it! It’s the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don’t know ‘bout that, we don’t know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we’ve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! “I don’t think she likes me.” The amazing thing is, that we still get women, don’t we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. That’s why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like",1
208,JERRY," So, I’m on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...",2
209,JERRY," Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it’s a woman in front of you that’s writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, y’know, ‘cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don’t know where that is, but the cheque book",2
210,ELAINE, “Coccoon II,2
211,JERRY," Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Y’know Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, she’s probably screamin’ at those aliens, “I gotta have a lo mein!”",2
212,ELAINE," Okay, what’re we doing here? I have seen everything.",2
213,JERRY, Oh yeah? I don’t believe you’ve seen... this.,2
214,ELAINE," Oh, lovely.",2
215,JERRY, Yeah.,2
216,ELAINE, What do you think their parents think?,2
217,JERRY," “So, uh, what’s your son doing now, Dr. Stevens?” “Oh, he’s a public fornicator. Yes, he’s a fine boy...”",2
218,ELAINE, Y’know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela’s birthday.,2
219,JERRY, Pamela? Do I know her?,2
220,ELAINE," Yeah, you met her when we were going out.",2
221,JERRY," Oh yeah, right...",2
222,ELAINE," You have no idea who I’m talking about, do you?",2
223,JERRY,  No.,2
224,ELAINE," Blonde hair, remember? Glasses?  Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?",2
225,JERRY,  Riverside Drive.,2
226,ELAINE," Right! In fact... No, never mind...",2
227,JERRY," Well, what is it?",2
228,ELAINE," Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but...  you don’t want to go to... that... no.",2
229,JERRY," Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.",2
230,ELAINE, What little deal?,2
231,JERRY," I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.",2
232,ELAINE," A wedding? Have you lost it, man?",2
233,JERRY," Y’know, my parents are coming in for this...",2
234,ELAINE, They’re coming in?,2
235,JERRY," Yeah, tomorrow.",2
236,ELAINE," Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?",2
237,JERRY," No, no. Still doin’ the big sweep across.",2
238,ELAINE, Why does he do that?,2
239,JERRY," Doesn’t think anyone can tell. So c’mon, do we have a deal?",2
240,ELAINE, A wedding?,2
241,JERRY, There’s a lot of people to mock...,2
242,ELAINE," All right, what the hell.",2
243,JERRY, Great!,2
244,WOMAN," When you’re dead, you’re dead. That’s it. You’re not goin’ anywhere...",2
245,ELAINE, C’mon lets go...,2
246,JERRY, Was I supposed to bring something?,2
247,ELAINE, You could have.,2
248,JERRY, I met her one time...,2
249,ELAINE, It is not necessary.,2
250,JERRY, What did you say then?,2
251,ELAINE, Sssshhhhhh!!!,2
252,PAMELA, Hi,2
253,ELAINE," Hi, Pamela, you remember Jerry.",2
254,PAMELA,"  Yes, we met.",2
255,JERRY," Hi, happy birthday.",2
256,PAMELA," Thanks, ah, everybody, this is Elaine and Jerry.",2
257,JERRY, I didn’t bring anything.,2
258,PAMELA," Uh, I put you two right here.",2
259,JERRY," Oh, Okay  I’m sorry, I didn’t know what to bring, nobody told me.",2
260,VANESSA, How big a tip do you think it’d take to get him to stop?,2
261,JERRY, I’m in for five...,2
262,VANESSA, I’ll supply the hat.,2
263,JERRY,  Uh-oh... What do we have here?,2
264,VANESSA, Why don’t you relax and take your jacket off?,2
265,JERRY," Oh, I can’t. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.",2
266,VANESSA, How masculine.,2
267,JERRY," Plus I’m wearing short sleeves, I don’t want to expose my tattoos.  She’s unbelievable!",2
268,ROGER,"  Hey, this guy says he knows Bricker.",2
269,VANESSA," Oh, you know Bricker! From where?",2
270,JERRY,"  What’s going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, she’s too good to be alone. What’s the difference, I can’t maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.",2
271,VANESSA,  How do you know Pamela?,2
272,JERRY," Uh, friend of a friend. And you?",2
273,VANESSA, We went to law school together.,2
274,ELAINE,"  Oh, Jerry!",2
275,JERRY,"  Oh no, not now.",2
276,ELAINE, I had this dream last night and you were in it.,2
277,JERRY," Oh really?  Oh God, I gotta get out of this.",2
278,ELAINE," You were you, but, you weren’t you...",2
279,JERRY," No kidding.  Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!",2
280,ELAINE," I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...",2
281,JERRY,  This is brutal.,2
282,ELAINE, You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.,2
283,JERRY," How do you like that? Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I can’t, I can’t. I’m stuck.",2
284,ELAINE,  Jerry? Are you listening to me?,2
285,JERRY," Yes, I heard you.",2
286,PAMELA," Elaine, what’s the name of that jewelry store you took me to that time?",2
287,JERRY,"  Thank you, Pamela!  So, you’re a lawyer...",2
288,VANESSA," Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.",2
289,JERRY,"  Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft...  Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.",2
290,VANESSA," Oh, that was you?",2
291,JERRY," Imagine, spelling “Mom” with two O’s.",2
292,VANESSA, Very funny! What do you do?,2
293,JERRY, Comedian.,2
294,VANESSA, Really? That explains it.,2
295,JERRY,"  Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.",2
296,ROGER, Are you ready?,2
297,VANESSA, We gotta run. Happy birthday!,2
298,JERRY,"  I can’t believe it. I got nothing! I don’t even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...",2
299,JERRY," That wasn’t so bad, really.",2
300,ELAINE," Y’know, um, you could use a little work on your manners.",2
301,JERRY, Why? What did I do?,2
302,ELAINE," Wel-Well, I just don’t appreciate these little courtesy responses, like I’m selling you aluminum siding.",2
303,JERRY, I was listening!,2
304,ELAINE, No! You couldn’t wait to get back to your little... “conversation”.,2
305,JERRY," No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.",2
306,ELAINE, Uh-huh...,2
307,JERRY," Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.",2
308,ELAINE," No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didn’t have wooden teeth, you did!",2
309,JERRY," All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?",2
310,ELAINE, So nothing! Nothing. ,2
311,JERRY," Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, “Yeah, I got this new thing",2
312,JERRY, Hey!,2
313,MORTY," Ah, there he is!",2
314,JERRY," This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!",2
315,HELEN," Y’know, Jerry, we don’t have to do this.",2
316,JERRY," What are you talkin’ about? It’s fine, I love having you here.",2
317,HELEN, Tomorrow we’ll go to a hotel.,2
318,JERRY," Ma, will you stop?",2
319,HELEN," No, why should we take over your apartment?",2
320,JERRY, I don’t care. I’m sleeping next door.,2
321,HELEN, Your friend Kramer doesn’t mind?,2
322,JERRY," No, he’s making a bouillabaisse.",2
323,JERRY," So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?",2
324,MORTY, Depends on the firm.,2
325,JERRY," Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?",2
326,MORTY, What’s the matter? You need a lawyer?,2
327,JERRY," No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I don’t know her name.",2
328,MORTY, So why don’t you ask someone who was at the party?,2
329,JERRY," Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can’t ask her.",2
330,HELEN, Why not?,2
331,JERRY, Because it’s complicated. There’s some tension there.,2
332,HELEN, He used to go with her.,2
333,HELEN, Which one is she?,2
334,MORTY, From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didn’t like.,2
335,HELEN," Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.",2
336,JERRY," Oh yeah, she’s great.",2
337,HELEN," So, how come nothing materialized there?",2
338,JERRY," Well, it’s a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...",2
339,HELEN, I know what it was.,2
340,JERRY, You don’t know what it was.,2
341,HELEN," So, what was it?",2
342,JERRY," Well, we fight a lot for some reason.",2
343,JERRY, And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.,2
344,HELEN," Well, I think she’s a very attractive girl.",2
345,JERRY," Oh, she is, she absolutely is.",2
346,HELEN, I can see if there was a weight problem...,2
347,JERRY," No, it’s not that. It wasn’t all one-sided.",2
348,HELEN," You know, you can’t be so particular. Nobody’s perfect.",2
349,JERRY," I know, I know...",2
350,MORTY," Y’know Jerry, it’s a good thing I wasn’t so particular.",2
351,HELEN,"  Idiot.  So who’re you looking for, Sophia Loren?",2
352,JERRY, That’s got nothin’ to do with it.,2
353,MORTY, How about Loni Anderson?,2
354,HELEN, Where do you get Loni Anderson?,2
355,MORTY," Why, what’s wrong with Loni Anderson?",2
356,HELEN, I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson.,2
357,JERRY," What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn’t the one.",2
358,HELEN, And this other one’s the one?,2
359,JERRY," I dunno, maybe...",2
360,MORTY, So ask Elaine there for her number.,2
361,JERRY," I can’t. She’ll get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.",2
362,HELEN, How could you still see her if your not interested?,2
363,JERRY, We’re friends.,2
364,MORTY, Doesn’t sound like you’re friends to me. If you were friends you'd-you’d ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?,2
365,JERRY, Oh yeah.,2
366,MORTY," Well, go up to the office.",2
367,HELEN, Up to her office?,2
368,MORTY," Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn’t she?",2
369,JERRY, I guess.,2
370,MORTY," So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.",2
371,JERRY, You mean stakeout the lobby?,2
372,HELEN," Morty, that’s ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!",2
373,MORTY, He doesn’t want to ask Elaine for the number.,2
374,HELEN, So you’ve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?,2
375,MORTY, He pretends he bumped into her!,2
376,JERRY, Y’know what? This is not that bad an idea.,2
377,GEORGE, What does she look like?,2
378,JERRY, I dunno. Hard to say.,2
379,GEORGE, What actress does she remind you of?,2
380,JERRY, Loni Anderson.,2
381,GEORGE, Loni Anderson?!,2
382,JERRY," What, there’s something wrong with Loni Anderson?  Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.",2
383,GEORGE," Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? ",2
384,JERRY, I’m a little nervous.,2
385,GEORGE," Yeah, me too...",2
386,JERRY," If I see her, what do I say that I’m doing here in the building?",2
387,GEORGE, You came to see me. I work in the building.,2
388,JERRY, What do you do?,2
389,GEORGE, I’m an architect.,2
390,JERRY, You’re an architect?,2
391,GEORGE, I’m not?,2
392,JERRY, I don’t see architecture comin from you.,2
393,GEORGE,  I suppose you could be an architect.,2
394,JERRY, I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin’ else.,2
395,GEORGE," All right, she’s not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.",2
396,JERRY," Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?",2
397,GEORGE, We’re having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.,2
398,JERRY, What is his name?,2
399,GEORGE, Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.,2
400,JERRY, Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.,2
401,GEORGE," No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....",2
402,JERRY, Art Cor...,2
403,GEORGE, ...velay.,2
404,JERRY, Corvelay?,2
405,GEORGE," Yeah, right.",2
406,JERRY," Well, what does he do?",2
407,GEORGE, He’s an importer.,2
408,JERRY," Just imports, no exports?",2
409,GEORGE,"  He’s an importer/exporter, okay?  Elaine ever call you back?",2
410,JERRY," No, I guess she’s still mad.",2
411,GEORGE," I don’t understand, you never talk to her about other women?",2
412,JERRY, Never.  Wait a second. That’s her. On the right.,2
413,GEORGE,  I forgot who I am! Who am I?!,2
414,JERRY, You’re you. We’re having lunch with Art Corvelay.,2
415,GEORGE, Vandelay!,2
416,JERRY, Corvelay!,2
417,GEORGE, Let me be the architect! I can do it!,2
418,JERRY," Hey, hey. uh Pamela’s birthday party, didn’t I see you there? Jerry.",2
419,VANESSA, Sure! Hi!,2
420,JERRY," Uh, this is George.  I’m sorry...",2
421,VANESSA, Vanessa.,2
422,GEORGE, Nice to meet you.,2
423,JERRY," Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.",2
424,VANESSA," That’s right! Yea, what’re you doing here?",2
425,JERRY," Oh, we’re meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.",2
426,GEORGE," Yeah, Art Vandelay.",2
427,VANESSA, Really? Which company?,2
428,VANESSA, Importer?,2
429,GEORGE, ...And exporter.,2
430,JERRY, He’s an importer/exporter.,2
431,GEORGE,"  I’m, uh, I’m an architect.",2
432,VANESSA, Really. What do you design?,2
433,GEORGE," Uh, railroads, uh...",2
434,VANESSA, I thought engineers do that.,2
435,GEORGE, They can...,2
436,JERRY, Y’know I’m sorry you had to leave so early the other night.,2
437,VANESSA," Oh, me too. My cousin had to go back to Boston.",2
438,JERRY," Oh, that guy was your cousin! ",2
439,VANESSA," Yeah, and that woman was your...",2
440,JERRY, Friend!,2
441,GEORGE," I’ll just, uh, get a paper...",2
442,JERRY," So, um, do you date uh immature men?",2
443,VANESSA, Almost exclusively...,2
444,HELEN, Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...,2
445,JERRY,"  Ma, will you go already?",2
446,HELEN, Bum bum bum bum...,2
447,JERRY, What are you doing?!,2
448,HELEN," Wait, I just want to see something.",2
449,JERRY," You can’t look in there, we’re playing!",2
450,KRAMER, Hi.,2
451,JERRY, Hi.,2
452,MORTY,"  Good evening, Mr. Kramer!",2
453,KRAMER, Hey Morty!  Salad dressing?,2
454,JERRY, Look.,2
455,HELEN, “Quo”. Is that a word?,2
456,JERRY, Maybe!,2
457,HELEN, Will you challenge it?,2
458,JERRY," Ma, you can’t look up words in the dictionary!  Dad, she’s cheating!",2
459,KRAMER, “Quo”? That’s not a word.,2
460,HELEN,  You’re such a stickler...,2
461,JERRY," Well put something down, you’re taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, they’re all coming over here before the wedding?",2
462,HELEN," They’ll be here at two o’clock. Oh, Elaine called. She said she’d be here at two-thirty. And she says “Hope your meeting went well with ‘Art Vandelay’?”",2
463,JERRY, She said what?,2
464,HELEN," Just what I said, here.",2
465,JERRY," She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.",2
466,HELEN, She knows what?,2
467,JERRY, She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...,2
468,HELEN," No, no, no, that won’t do. He may have a “Z”.",2
469,MORTY," So, how did she find out?",2
470,JERRY," Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.",2
471,MORTY," So, what are you? Afraid of her?",2
472,JERRY, Yes. Yes I am!  What else did she say on the phone?,2
473,HELEN, Whatever I wrote down.,2
474,JERRY," Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?",2
475,HELEN," Who am I, Rich Little?",2
476,MORTY," Well, she can’t be too mad. She’s still coming to the wedding.",2
477,JERRY," Yeah, but now I’m nervous.",2
478,HELEN," Oh, stop it.",2
479,JERRY, “Quone”?,2
480,HELEN, ...30...31...,2
481,JERRY," “Quone”? No, I’m afraid that I’m going to have to challenge that.",2
482,HELEN, ...32...,2
483,KRAMER," No, you don’t have to challenge that. That’s a word. That’s a definite word.",2
484,JERRY, I am challenging.,2
485,KRAMER, Quone. To quone something.,2
486,JERRY, Uh-huh.,2
487,HELEN, I’m not playing with you anymore.,2
488,MORTY, Quone’s not a word.,2
489,JERRY, No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.,2
490,HELEN,  Why did you make me put that down?,2
491,KRAMER," Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him.",2
492,CAROL," You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where I work, now that’s a sitcom!",2
493,JERRY, You must have quite a time down there.,2
494,CAROL, We got plenty of time.,2
495,JERRY," Oh, I’m sorry. I’m just waiting for someone.",2
496,UNCLE MAC, Watch what you say to this guy. He’ll put it in his next act!,2
497,JERRY," Yeah, yeah...",2
498,UNCLE MAC," Jerry, did I tell you that I’m writing a book? An autobiography.",2
499,JERRY," Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it.",2
500,UNCLE MAC, It’s based on all my experiences!,2
501,JERRY, That’s perfect.,2
502,JERRY, Could you excuse me one second? I’m sorry.,2
503,JERRY," How do you do?  Uh, Jerry Seinfeld.",2
504,ELAINE," Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes.",2
505,JERRY," Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?",2
506,ELAINE," Oh no, let’s do it now.",2
507,JERRY," All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-",2
508,ELAINE, Okay.,2
509,ARTIE," Jerry, were you goin’ with us?",2
510,JERRY," No, I’m gonna take my car.",2
511,ARTIE, That’s why I brought the wagon. Why the hell did I bring the wagon?,2
512,JERRY," Anyway, you know why I didn’t ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.",2
513,ELAINE," Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.",2
514,CAROL," Jerry, we’ll see you there. Bye, Elaine.",2
515,ELAINE," Oh, bye. Good to see you.",2
516,ARTIE," Oh, we didn’t meet.",2
517,JERRY," Oh, I’m sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.",2
518,ARTIE,  Levine.,2
519,JERRY,"  Yeah, “Levine”. And I’m Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.",2
520,ELAINE," Yeah, obviously.",2
521,JERRY," I mean, if we’re gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.",2
522,ELAINE, Couldn’t agree more.,2
523,JERRY, Good.,2
524,ELAINE, Good.,2
525,JERRY, Good.,2
526,ELAINE, Great!,2
527,JERRY, Great? Where do you get ‘great’?,2
528,ELAINE, It’s great to... talk about... other people...,2
529,JERRY, ...Guys?,2
530,ELAINE, Yeah.,2
531,JERRY," Uh-huh. Yeah. So, anybody specific?",2
532,ELAINE, No. A general guy.,2
533,JERRY, Oh really? Elaine Marie Benes...,2
534,ELAINE," What? No, it’s not a big deal.",2
535,JERRY," No, that’s great! That’s terrific!",2
536,ELAINE," No, we just met...",2
537,JERRY, Doesn’t matter. What’s the young man’s name? I would like to meet him.,2
538,ELAINE," Hmmm, I don’t think so.",2
539,JERRY," Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?",2
540,ELAINE, Wall street.,2
541,JERRY," Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.",2
542,ELAINE, And he happens to be pretty good lookin’.,2
543,JERRY,"  All right, sir.",2
544,ELAINE, And... he’s hilarious.,2
545,JERRY, Now that’s not fair! So where did you meet this guy?,2
546,ELAINE, I staked out his health club.,2
547,JERRY," Uh huh. When you’re on a stakeout, do you find it’s better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?",2
548,JERRY," Y’know I think that even if you’ve had a relationship with someone, or let’s say, especially if you’ve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, it’s very difficult. Isn’t this? It’s hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. It’s like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, “Look, a rabbit.” The other goes, “So? I believe this is your card.” “Look, why don’t we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?”",2
549,JERRY," So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. It’s a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and I’m supposed to feel bad. Is that the way it’s supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldn’t you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. ‘Cause it’s not easy to give someone the toe, you’ve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and...  “Look at that toe, buddy.”  I mean, that’s really insulting to get the toe, isn’t it?",3
550,JERRY," Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane.  That’s it. Done!",3
551,ELAINE,  That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.,3
552,JERRY,  I am...the master packer.,3
553,ELAINE,"  Yeah, right, you’re the master packer.",3
554,JERRY," What you must understand, Elaine,  packing is no different than leading men into battle.  You’ve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.",3
555,ELAINE,"  ‘Scuse me, master packer...",3
556,JERRY, Yes.,3
557,ELAINE, Just gimme your keys.,3
558,JERRY," All right, sir.  George?",3
559,GEORGE,  Yeah.,3
560,ELAINE," Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?",3
561,JERRY," Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.",3
562,ELAINE," Okay, this is quite a place.",3
563,JERRY, There’s more. The refrigerator.,3
564,JERRY," Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates.  No meat, no leftovers, no butter.  And I cannot overstate this",3
565,ELAINE, I’ll eat out.,3
566,JERRY," One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity",3
567,GEORGE,  Ready?,3
568,JERRY," Yeah, one sec.",3
569,GEORGE," Hey, Elaine.",3
570,ELAINE, Hi.,3
571,GEORGE, Coming to the airport with us?,3
572,ELAINE," No, I’m staying here for the weekend. I’m getting a break from my roommate.",3
573,GEORGE," Oh, the actress-waitress?",3
574,ELAINE," No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of “A Chorus Line”. So, now all day long she’s walking around the apartment singing, “God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it!” She’s gonna get it right in her...",3
575,GEORGE, So just kick her out.,3
576,ELAINE, She’s on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.,3
577,GEORGE," Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range.  But you, my friend, may be in luck.",3
578,JERRY, I’m not looking.,3
579,GEORGE," No no no, this one’s different. This one’s a beauty!",3
580,JERRY," Yeah, what’s it like?",3
581,GEORGE," I haven’t seen it yet, but it’s a two-bedroom, it’s on the uh, west 83rd, ‘bout a half block from the park?",3
582,JERRY, How much?,3
583,GEORGE," Uh, twice what you’re payin’ here, but it’s a great building. It’s two bedrooms!",3
584,JERRY, Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one.  I saw that.,3
585,ELAINE, You oughta at least take a look at it.,3
586,JERRY, Really? Why?,3
587,ELAINE, ‘Cause then I could move in here.,3
588,JERRY, Ohhhh...,3
589,ELAINE, It’s time you got outta here anyway.,3
590,GEORGE," Yeah, tell ‘im. But quickly, I’m double parked here.",3
591,ELAINE," Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you can’t have soft cheese...",3
592,GEORGE, Let’s not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.,3
593,ELAINE," Jerry, come on, you’re doin’ okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldn’t have to live like this.",3
594,JERRY, Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.,3
595,ELAINE," Well, for me it’s a step up. It’s like moving from Iceland to Finland.",3
596,GEORGE," Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?",3
597,JERRY," I can’t think about it now. Come on, I’m going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.													 ",3
598,JERRY, Elaine.  ELAINE!,3
599,ELAINE,"  JERRY!  Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?",3
600,JERRY," Great, I had fun. Where’s the TV, where’s the VCR?",3
601,JERRY, What?,3
602,ELAINE, They were stolen.,3
603,JERRY, Stolen? When?,3
604,ELAINE, A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.,3
605,JERRY, Stolen?,3
606,ELAINE,  Someone left the door open.,3
607,JERRY,  You left the door open?!,3
608,KRAMER," Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin’ and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, ‘cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!",3
609,JERRY," Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?",3
610,KRAMER,  The door.,3
611,JERRY, The door? You left the door open?,3
612,KRAMER," Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.",3
613,JERRY," Yeah, and?",3
614,KRAMER," Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. “The Bold And The Beautiful”.",3
615,JERRY, So the door was wide open?,3
616,KRAMER, Wide open!,3
617,JERRY,  And where were you?,3
618,ELAINE, I was at Bloomingdale’s... waiting for the shower to heat up.,3
619,KRAMER," Look, Jerry, I’m sorry, I’m uh- you have insurance, right buddy?",3
620,JERRY, No.,3
621,KRAMER,  How can you not have insurance?,3
622,JERRY, Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. It’s the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door...  ...MUST BE CLOSED!!,3
623,KRAMER," Jerry! I’m gonna find your stuff. I’m gonna solve it, I’m on the case, buddy, I’m on the case.",3
624,JERRY," Yeah, don’t investigate, don’t pay me back, it was an accident.",3
625,KRAMER,  I made a mistake.,3
626,ELAINE, These things happen.,3
627,KRAMER, I’m human.,3
628,JERRY, In your way.,3
629,POLICEMAN," Let’s see, that’s, one TV, a stereo, one leather jacket, a VCR and a computer...is that ‘bout it?",3
630,ELAINE, Answering machine.,3
631,JERRY,"  Answering machine.  Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.",3
632,POLICEMAN, What do you mean?,3
633,JERRY, It’s a joke.,3
634,POLICEMAN," I see. Well, mister Seinfeld uh, we’ll look into it and uh, we’ll let you know if we uh, you know, if we find anything.",3
635,JERRY, You ever find anything?,3
636,POLICEMAN, No.,3
637,JERRY," Well, thanks anyway.",3
638,POLICEMAN, You bet.,3
639,ELAINE, I didn’t get that joke either.,3
640,JERRY, The crook has the machine. The messages aren’t for him. He’s the crook. Why would he answer-  How did you get in here?,3
641,GEORGE ," I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.",3
642,JERRY, Again?,3
643,GEORGE, I don’t know how you put up with this.,3
644,ELAINE," Yeah, tell ‘im George.",3
645,JERRY,  You would still wanna move in here?,3
646,ELAINE, Yes! You don’t understand. I’m living with Ethel Merman without the talent.,3
647,JERRY,"  Is that uh, other apartment still available?",3
648,JERRY," I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, it’s very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, “Call the police. You really should call the police.” So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, “Yeah, I’m calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... I’m gonna see some real action.” Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out",3
649,ELAINE," Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?",3
650,GEORGE," I didn’t know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.",3
651,JERRY, How do you get all that wood in here?,3
652,ELAINE, They deliver it.,3
653,JERRY, They deliver wood?,3
654,ELAINE, Yeah.,3
655,JERRY, What do you tip a wood guy?,3
656,GEORGE, I didn’t know there was a fireplace.,3
657,ELAINE, Look! Look at- look at this! There’s a garden.,3
658,GEORGE, A garden! I can’t believe there’s a garden!,3
659,JERRY, Would I have to get a gardener?,3
660,ELAINE," Yeah, you can get a gardener.",3
661,JERRY, You tip him?,3
662,ELAINE, You can.,3
663,GEORGE,  You don’t tip a gardener!,3
664,ELAINE, You can tip a gardener.,3
665,GEORGE, You don’t need a gardener.,3
666,ELAINE," Jerry, you can barbecue back here.",3
667,JERRY, They deliver the coal?,3
668,ELAINE," Sure, it’s...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.",3
669,JERRY," Oh, then I gotta tip him.",3
670,ELAINE," Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!",3
671,JERRY, I don’t have any plants.,3
672,GEORGE, I have plants. ,3
673,ELAINE," Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! I’m walking in it!  It’s a walk-in. Can you believe it? I’m nuts about this, what do you think?",3
674,JERRY," I like that.  What do you think, George?",3
675,GEORGE, It’s your decision.,3
676,JERRY," I’m takin’ it, I’m takin’ the place. I’m gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. I’m livin’ here...I’m movin’.",3
677,ELAINE,  Your movin’? That means I’m movin’.  Geeeeee  isn’t that incredible!,3
678,GEORGE,  Congratulations.													 ,3
679,ELAINE, What about the couch?,3
680,JERRY, You like the couch? I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do.,3
681,ELAINE, What?,3
682,JERRY," You’re movin’ in, you’re a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars.  Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I don’t even wanna see it, go, get it out.",3
683,ELAINE, A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?,3
684,JERRY, Yeah!,3
685,ELAINE, For this couch?!,3
686,JERRY," Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?",3
687,ELAINE," Okay, uh, I’ll tell you what. I could go as high as uh...  I don’t know, maybe...twenty dollars?",3
688,JERRY, Yeah?,3
689,GEORGE,"  Yeah, it’s George.",3
690,JERRY," Come on up.  Oh, all right, forget it, I’m gonna take it with me now...  I’m just gonna pack up the cushions right now...",3

693,ELAINE," Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?",3
694,JERRY, Fifty dollars?,3
695,ELAINE, Uh-huh.,3
696,JERRY, Thank you very much.,3
697,ELAINE, Thank you very much.,3
698,GEORGE," Hey, what’s goin’ on?",3
699,ELAINE, I just bought Jerry’s couch for fifty dollars.,3
700,JERRY,"  So did you bring the lease?  All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.",3
701,GEORGE,"  Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.",3
702,JERRY, Why?,3
703,GEORGE," If you’re having second thoughts, if you didn’t want it, don’t worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.",3
704,JERRY, You could take it? You want it?,3
705,GEORGE," No, I don’t want it. I want it, if you don’t want it.",3
706,JERRY, So you do want it.,3
707,GEORGE," No I, I want it if you don’t want it.",3
708,JERRY, You just said you wanted it!,3
709,GEORGE," No, I’m saying, if a situation arose in which you didn’t want it, I might take it.",3
710,JERRY, So take it.,3
711,GEORGE, How can I take it?,3
712,JERRY, How can I take it?,3
713,GEORGE, It’s your apartment!,3
714,JERRY," How can I want it now, if you want it?",3
715,ELAINE," Excuse me, uh, I don’t mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?",3
716,GEORGE," Yes, but I am not taking it.",3
717,JERRY, I...am not taking it.,3
718,ELAINE," Well, one of you better damn well take it!",3
719,JERRY," Well, whaddaya wanna do here?",3
720,GEORGE," I, I don’t know.",3
721,JERRY, Do you wanna flip a coin?,3
722,GEORGE," Who flips? You’ll flip, I’ll call.",3
723,JERRY," Okay, fine.  This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and that’s it. Agreed?",3
724,GEORGE, I’m good.,3
725,ELAINE," I don’t know, who to root for, George’s place has carpeting.",3
726,JERRY," All right, now you call it in the air.",3

732,GEORGE," No, it hit the table, it hit the table.",3
733,JERRY, So what?,3
734,GEORGE," Interference! You can’t count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.",3
735,JERRY, You didn’t call no interference!,3
736,GEORGE, You don’t have to call that! That’s a rule!,3
737,JERRY, I don’t believe this.,3
738,GEORGE," Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!",3
739,JERRY," I don’t wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?",3

756,BOTH," Once, twice, three, shoot!",3
757,GEORGE, Congratulations...congratulations.,3
758,JERRY, Thanks.,3
759,GEORGE, I'm just gonna...wash.  WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?,3
760,KRAMER," Jerry, I think I’m on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?",3
761,JERRY, Yeah.,3
762,KRAMER, The last couple a days he’s been acting very strange. I think he’s avoiding me.,3
763,JERRY, Hard to imagine.,3
764,KRAMER, Yeah! And get this,3
765,KRAMER," ..you know, very casually,",3
766,JERRY, Right.,3
767,KRAMER,  so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.,3
768,ELAINE, So what did he say?,3
769,KRAMER, “What stuff?”,3
770,JERRY," Ooh,  case closed!",3
771,KRAMER," No, you don’t understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, I’m gonna go over there, I’m gonna borrow some tea. If I don’t get back in five minutes, maybe you’d better call the police.",3
772,JERRY," Okay, starting...NOW!",3
773,KRAMER, Yeah!,3
774,JERRY," One of the problems in life is that when you’re a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, “I got the front seat” “I wanted the front seat!” “I called it”. And the other kid knows he’s got nothing to say",3
775,GEORGE, I love the mirror in that bathroom! I don’t know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror.  I don’t know if it’s the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.,3
776,JERRY," It’s a good mirror.  So, what are you gettin’?",3
777,GEORGE," I don’t know, I can’t eat. You, you can’t have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs",3
778,JERRY," All right, forget it, forget it. I’m not taking the place!",3
779,GEORGE, What?!,3
780,JERRY, How can I live there?,3
781,GEORGE, Why not?!,3
782,JERRY," Look at you, you’re still thinking about it. I’ll never feel comfortable.",3
783,GEORGE," Oh, get outta here.",3
784,JERRY, How can I ever have you over? You’ll sit there moping.,3
785,GEORGE, I won’t mope.,3
786,JERRY, You’re already moping! Would you take the place?,3
787,GEORGE," No, impossible! It’s your apartment.",3
788,JERRY, You found the place.,3
789,GEORGE, You won the choose.,3
790,JERRY," All right, forget it, it’s over, I’m not moving.",3
791,GEORGE," Well, me neither.",3
792,JERRY, Definitely?,3
793,GEORGE, Definitely.,3
794,JERRY," Alright, then just get rid of it. You won’t have any problem.",3
795,GEORGE," No, it’s not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.",3
796,CAROL, What apartment?,3
797,GEORGE," Oh, it’s a great place, it’s uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd ‘bout half block from the park.",3
798,CAROL, What’s the rent?,3
799,GEORGE," I don’t know, what we’re doin’ here, this is ridiculous.",3
800,JERRY, She wanted to thank us for the apartment.,3
801,ELAINE, I can’t believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.,3
802,JERRY, If only the coin hadn’t hit the table.,3
803,GEORGE," The table is interference, you know it!",3
804,JERRY, It is not!,3
805,GEORGE, It is too!,3
806,ELAINE, My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on “Carousel”.,3
807,CAROL, Hi.,3
808,GEORGE," Hi, Carol.",3
809,CAROL," I just wanted to introduce you to my husband, this is Larry.",3
810,CAROL," This is George, Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment.",3
811,LARRY," Oh, you don’t know how grateful I am, if there’s anything I can ever do to repay you, I, I mean, we’re just so thrilled with this place.",3
812,CAROL, It’s a dream.,3
813,LARRY," I’m running in the park now, I’ve lost weight, we’re barbecuing every night and the rent is unbelievable.",3
814,GEORGE, We’re really glad for you.,3
815,ELAINE, Couldn’t be happier.,3
816,JERRY, It’s wonderful.,3
817,CAROL," Diane, Diane, come here.",3
818,CAROL," This is my new next door neighbour, Diane.",3
819,CAROL,"  These are the guys, who turned this place down, can you believe it?  Diane gave me the greatest backrub today. She’s a masseuse!",3
820,DIANE," How, how could you guys have turned this place down, it’s such a great location and it’s...so close to the park.",3
821,GEORGE," We’re aware of the proximity to the park, yes.",3
822,DIANE," Well, it was nice to meet you.",3
823,GEORGE, Nice meeting you.,3
824,JERRY," How late are the stores open? I’m thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head.",3
825,JERRY," Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guy’s out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, it’s true, men hear a drill, it’s like a dog whistle. Just...  you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, “Honey, I think Jim’s working on something over there.” So they run over to the guy. Now they don’t actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. That’s what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, “What are you using, a Phillips-head?” You know, we feel involved. That’s why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, that’s just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they don’t cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. “What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, that’ll hold.”",4
826,GEORGE, I had to say something.  I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.,4
827,JERRY, I don’t think you did anything wrong.,4
828,GEORGE, I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I don’t tell you.,4
829,JERRY, We can only thank God for that.,4
830,GEORGE, I’m outta the picture. I am outta the picture.  It’s only a matter of time now.,4
831,JERRY, You’re imagining this. Really.,4
832,GEORGE," Oh, no. No no no no.",4
833,GEORGE, I’ll tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.,4
834,JERRY, What floss? When?,4
835,GEORGE," We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; there’s this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.",4
836,JERRY," Ah, mint.",4
837,GEORGE," Of course. So, I’m looking at it. I look up, I see she’s looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..",4
838,JERRY," So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.",4
839,GEORGE," If I didn’t put that floss in my pocket, I’d be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.",4
840,JERRY, And you’re sure the floss was the catalyst?,4
841,GEORGE," Yes, I am.",4
842,JERRY, You don’t think it might’ve had anything to do with that?,4
843,GEORGE, What? You don’t like this?,4
844,JERRY, It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.,4
845,KRAMER,"  Oh, they’ve got a cure for cancer. See, it’s all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George.  Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.",4
846,JERRY,  Who is it?,4
847,KRAMER, Take it.,4
848,JERRY, Who is it?,4
849,KRAMER, It’s for you.,4
850,JERRY,"  Hello?  Oh, hi Joel.  No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesn’t know anything. He’s just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. I’m meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesday’s okay... All right. Uh, I’m a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye.  Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.",4
851,KRAMER," Well, it’s your phone. He wanted to talk to you.",4
852,JERRY, Maybe I didn’t want to talk to him.,4
853,KRAMER," Well, why not?",4
854,JERRY, He bothers me. I don’t even answer the phone anymore because of him. He’s turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.,4
855,GEORGE, What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? We’re not going?,4
856,JERRY, We’re going. That’s next Wednesday.,4
857,GEORGE, Oh. Who is this guy?,4
858,JERRY, His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I would’ve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. He’s so self-involved.,4
859,KRAMER," That’s for me.  Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...",4
860,JERRY, Can you conduct your business elsewhere?,4
861,KRAMER,  No no no. I’m talking about a whole chain of ‘em. Yeah.,4
862,GEORGE," I don’t know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, I’ll tell you that.",4
863,JERRY, I don’t bother with him. He’s been calling me for seven years. I’ve never called him once! He’s got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if he’s paying attention.,4
864,GEORGE, I don’t understand why you spend time with this guy.,4
865,JERRY," What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, “I don’t think we’re right for each other.” He’s a guy! At least with a woman, there’s a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.",4
866,GEORGE," No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.",4
867,JERRY, Just break up with him?,4
868,GEORGE, Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.,4
869,JERRY, The Truth.,4
870,JERRY," As a guy I don’t know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I don’t know how to say, “Bill, I feel I need to see other men.” Do you know what I mean? There’s nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think that’s the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because they’re two guys. That’s almost all we need to have in common. ‘Cause sports – sports and women – is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, “So, what’s in the refrigerator?”",4
871,JOEL," ...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think, uh, Geraldo.",4
872,JERRY," You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-",4
873,JOEL,"  Hey hey hey hey, we’re starving here! We’ve been waiting here for ten minutes already!",4
874,JERRY,"  So, I’m thinking about going to Iran this summer.",4
875,JOEL," I have to eat! I mean, I’m hypoglycemic.",4
876,JERRY," Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform.  You know, it’s their annual terrorist luncheon.",4
877,JOEL, Yeah.,4
878,JERRY,  I’m gonna do it in Farsi.,4
879,JOEL, Do you think I need a haircut?,4
880,CLAIRE, Are you ready?,4
881,JERRY," Yeah, I’ll have the egg salad on whole wheat.",4
882,JOEL,"  Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I don’t want that processed turkey.  I hate it.",4
883,WAITRESS, I think it’s real turkey.,4
884,JOEL, Is there a real bird in the back?,4
885,WAITRESS," No, there’s not bird but-",4
886,JOEL," Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why don’t you do me a favor. Why don’t you go in the back and find out, okay?  Unbelievable.",4
887,JERRY, How can you talk to someone like that?,4
888,JOEL," What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?",4
889,JERRY," Listen, Joel. There’s something I have to tell you...",4
890,JOEL,"  Wait, you’ll never guess who I ran into.",4
891,JERRY, Howard Metro.,4
892,JOEL, Howard Metro.,4
893,JOEL," He asked me if I still saw you. I said, “Sure, I see him all the time. We’re still great friends.” Anyway, Howard says hello. ",4
894,JERRY," Listen, Joel, I don’t think we should see each other anymore.",4
895,JOEL, What?,4
896,JERRY, This friendship,4
897,JOEL, Not working? What are you talking about?,4
898,JERRY, We’re just not suited to be friends.,4
899,JOEL, How can you say that?,4
900,JERRY," Look, you’re a nice guy, it’s just that... we don’t have anything in common.",4
901,JOEL,  Wai-Wait. What did I do? Tell me. I want to know what I did.,4
902,JERRY," Y-You didn’t do anything. It’s not you, it’s me. It’s- this is very difficult.",4
903,JOEL," Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know you’re a very busy guy.",4
904,JERRY," No, it’s not that.",4
905,JOEL,  You’re one of the few people I can talk to.,4
906,JERRY," Oh, come on. That’s not true.",4
907,JOEL," I always tell everybody about you. Tell everybody to  GO SEE HIS SHOW!  I mean, I’m your biggest fan!",4
908,JERRY," I know, I know.",4
909,JOEL," I mean, you’re my best friend.",4
910,JERRY, Best friend- I’ve never been to your apartment.,4
911,JOEL, I cannot believe that this is happening. I can’t believe it.,4
912,JERRY," Okay, okay. Forget it. It’s okay. I didn’t mean it.",4
913,JOEL, Didn’t mean what?,4
914,JERRY, What I said. I’ve been under a lot of stress.,4
915,JOEL," Oh, you’ve been under a lot of stress.",4
916,JERRY," Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it. I took it out on you. We’re still friends. We’re still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, I’ll tell you what. I’ve got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.",4
917,JOEL, Tonight?,4
918,JERRY," No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I would’ve said tonight.",4
919,JOEL, Do you really want me to go?,4
920,JERRY,  Yes.,4
921,JOEL," Okay.  Yeah, okay. Great! That would be, that’d be great. So, next Wednesday.",4
922,JERRY, Next Wednesday.,4
923,JOEL, Where is that waitress?  Hey!,4
924,GEORGE, ...she calls me up at my office,4
925,JERRY, Yeah.,4
926,GEORGE,"  she says, “We have to talk.”",4
927,JERRY," Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.",4
928,GEORGE," That, or “Who’s bra is this?”",4
929,JERRY, That is worse.,4
930,GEORGE," So we order lunch, and we’re talking. Finally, she blurts out how it’s ‘not working’.",4
931,JERRY, Really.,4
932,GEORGE," So, I’m thinking, as she’s saying this, I’m thinking",4
933,JERRY, Hm. You ate.,4
934,GEORGE," We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.",4
935,JERRY," Someone says, “Get out of my life,” and that doesn’t affect your appetite?",4
936,GEORGE, Have you ever had their egg salad?,4
937,JERRY, It is unbelievable.,4
938,GEORGE, It’s unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didn’t even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.,4
939,JERRY, How much could you possibly have in there?,4
940,GEORGE, It’s my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.,4
941,JERRY," Yeah? Where’d he go, to an arcade?",4
942,GEORGE,  That’s funny. You’re a funny guy.,4
943,JERRY," C’mon, move up.",4
944,CUSTOMER," Oh great, Ewing’s hurt.",4
945,GEORGE, Ewing’s hurt? How long is he going to be out?,4
946,CUSTOMER, A couple of days at the most but...,4
947,GEORGE, Geez.,4
948,JERRY," Oh, God.",4
949,GEORGE, I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.,4
950,JERRY," Listen, George, little problem with the game.",4
951,GEORGE, What about it?,4
952,JERRY," The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..",4
953,GEORGE, What?,4
954,JERRY, I gave your ticket to Horneck.,4
955,GEORGE,  You what?!,4
956,JERRY," Yeah, I’m sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.",4
957,GEORGE, No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?,4
958,JERRY," C’mon, c’mon, go ahead, move up.",4
959,GEORGE, Why did you give him my ticket for?,4
960,JERRY, You didn’t see him. It was horrible.,4
961,GEORGE," Oh, c’mon, Jerry. I can’t believe this.",4
962,JERRY, I had to do it.,4
963,GEORGE," Oh, please.  Can you change this into bills?",4
964,TELLER," I’m sorry, sir. We can’t do that.",4
965,JERRY, Do you want to go with him? You go. I don’t mind.,4
966,GEORGE," I’m not going with him. I don’t even know the guy.  Look, they did this for me before.",4
967,TELLER," Look, I can give you these and you can roll them yourself.",4
968,GEORGE," You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!",4
969,JERRY," No, I do not like the bank. I’ve heard the expression “Laughing all the way to the bank.” I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when there’s nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, it’s empty and you still have to go through the little maze.  “Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? I’m almost at the front. I’d like a reward for this please.”",4
970,GEORGE," ...thirty-two, thirty-three-",4
971,JERRY, George.,4
972,GEORGE, Not now.,4
973,JERRY, Could you stop the counting?,4
974,GEORGE, Nnnnnnngaaa!,4
975,GEORGE, What?!,4
976,JERRY, Can I make it up to you? I’ll give you fifty bucks for the jug.,4
977,GEORGE," Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.",4
978,JERRY," Well, then I’m not going to the game either. Okay? I’ll give him both tickets.",4
979,GEORGE," Oh geeeee.  Go, go!",4
980,JERRY," I- no, I don’t want to go.",4
981,GEORGE, He was really crying?,4
982,JERRY," I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and I’ll just make up some excuse why I can’t go to the game either.",4
983,GEORGE," Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as you’re going to lie to the guy, why don’t you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?",4
984,JERRY," George, the man wept.",4
985,KRAMER," Oh, hey guys. Man, I’m telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.",4
986,GEORGE, This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?,4
987,KRAMER," Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.",4
988,GEORGE," You know, you have to know how to do that. You can’t have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!",4
989,KRAMER, It’s all supervised.,4
990,GEORGE," Oh, well...",4
991,KRAMER, All of it. You want to invest?,4
992,GEORGE, My money’s all tied up in change right now.,4
993,KRAMER," No, I’m tellin’ you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.",4
994,JERRY," I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I can’t imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but that’s me. Alright",4
995,KRAMER, That’s you.,4
996,JERRY, I’m just saying..Alright.,4
997,KRAMER," Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.",4
998,JERRY, Okay.,4
999,KRAMER," You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.",4
1000,KRAMER," One day, you’ll beg me to make your own pie.",4
1001,JERRY,"  Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I can’t make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, he’s got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. They’re at the Will-Call window... And I’m really sorry... Have a good time... We’ll talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I don’t... Fine.. Fine... Bye.",4
1002,GEORGE, Trapezoid?,4
1003,JERRY, I know. I’m really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.,4
1004,ELAINE," Come on, let’s go do something. I don’t wanna just sit around here.",4
1005,JERRY, Okay.,4
1006,ELAINE, Want to go get something to eat?,4
1007,JERRY, Where do you want to go?,4
1008,ELAINE," I don’t care, I’m not hungry.",4
1009,JERRY, We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.,4
1010,ELAINE, What are we gonna do there? Talk?,4
1011,JERRY, We could talk.,4
1012,ELAINE, I’ll go if I don’t have to talk.,4
1013,JERRY, Then we’ll just sit there.,4
1014,ELAINE," Okay. I’m gonna check my machine first.  Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...",4
1015,JERRY," Okay, just hand that over, please.",4
1016,ELAINE," Oh, what is this?",4
1017,JERRY," It’s a list of excuses, it’s for that guy, Horneck, who’s at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I don’t have to see him.  I need it.  What are you doing?",4
1018,ELAINE, I got some for you.,4
1019,JERRY, I don’t need any more.,4
1020,ELAINE," No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen",4
1021,JERRY,  Very funny.,4
1022,ELAINE, How about,4
1023,JERRY," I’m Dan. Can I have my list back, please?",4
1024,ELAINE," Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe you’re doing this. This is absolutely infantile.",4
1025,JERRY, What can I do?,4
1026,ELAINE, Deal with it. Be a man!,4
1027,JERRY, Oh no. That’s impossible. I’d rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.,4
1028,ELAINE, You made a man cry? I’ve never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didn’t cry. I got the cab.,4
1029,JERRY, Couple of tough monkeys.,4
1030,KRAMER," Oh, hi Elaine, hey.  Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!",4
1031,JERRY, Game?,4
1032,KRAMER, Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!,4
1033,JERRY, Wait. How does Horneck know you?,4
1034,KRAMER," Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. He’s really into my pizza place idea!",4
1035,JERRY, This is too much.,4
1036,ELAINE," Wait, what pizza place idea?",4
1037,JERRY," Oh, no.",4
1038,KRAMER, You get to make your own pie!,4
1039,ELAINE," Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.",4
1040,KRAMER, Yea.,4
1041,JOEL,  Kramer.,4
1042,KRAMER, Yeah.,4
1043,JERRY, Perfect.,4
1044,JOEL, Hey.,4
1045,KRAMER," Okay, who wants meatloaf?",4
1046,KRAMER,  It’s gonna be hot in a minute.,4
1047,JOEL," So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?",4
1048,JERRY," Oh, we finished early.",4
1049,JOEL," M-hm, I’ll bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your ‘nephew’?",4
1050,JERRY," Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.",4
1051,ELAINE, Hi.,4
1052,JOEL," Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?",4
1053,JERRY, We’re still friends.,4
1054,JOEL," So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, I’m going to take you. How about next Tuesday night?  And why don’t you come along?",4
1055,ELAINE," Oh, no no. Tuesday’s uh no good becasue we’ve got choir practice.",4
1056,JERRY, Right. I forgot about choir.,4
1057,ELAINE, We-We’re doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.,4
1058,JERRY," Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.",4
1059,JOEL, What about Thursday night? I mean they’re playing the Sonics.,4
1060,ELAINE, Huh... Thursday is no good because we’ve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.,4
1061,JOEL," You know, I should really try something like that.",4
1062,JERRY, You really should.,4
1063,JOEL," Well, let’s just take a look here.",4
1064,JOEL," Forty-one home games. Let's see saturday night we’ve got the Mavericks. If you don’t like the Mavericks, next Tuesday",4
1065,JERRY," You know, I really... I’ve come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that they’re just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you don’t really wanna see them. You don’t call them, they call you. You don’t call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you don’t really have anything in common with is to pretend you’re hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend there’s a little desk around you. The only problem with this is there’s no way you can say, “Hey, it’s been great having you on the show. We’re out of time.”",4
1066,JERRY," Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because money’s a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you don’t care about money when you’re hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, you’re like the ruler of an empire. “More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives.” Then after the meal, you know, you’ve got the pants open, you’ve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. They’re mystified by the check. “What is this? How could this be?” They start passing it around the table, “Does this look right to you? We’re not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?”",5
1067,JERRY, I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.,5
1068,GEORGE, I never heard him say anything really funny.,5
1069,JERRY," But it’s common sense. He’s got super strength, super speed. I’m sure he’s got super humor.",5
1070,GEORGE," You would think that, but either you’re born with a sense of humor, or you’re not. It’s not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.",5
1071,JERRY, Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?,5
1072,GEORGE, I don’t know. But he ain’t funny.,5
1073,ELAINE," I know, I know. I’m sorry I’m late.",5
1074,JERRY, No problem.,5
1075,ELAINE, I dropped a grape.,5
1076,GEORGE, Pardon?,5
1077,ELAINE," I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldn’t find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.",5
1078,JERRY," Were you crying? I mean, it’s just a grape. You’ll find it.",5
1079,ELAINE," No, I’m just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I’m going out with...",5
1080,JERRY, Robert.,5
1081,ELAINE," Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and I’m allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I can’t even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actor’s studio so we can’t go there. It’s really causing a lot of problems, you know. He won’t even go away for the weekend because of these cats.",5
1082,GEORGE, Guys with cats... I don’t know.,5
1083,JERRY," I’ve been thinking about asking this girl I’m, uh, seeing-",5
1084,ELAINE, Vanessa.,5
1085,JERRY," Vanessa, thank you. I’ve been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.",5
1086,GEORGE," Oh, no. No no no no no. I’d have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Let’s see, you’re going to be with her seventy-two hours. That’s a dating decathlon.",5
1087,ELAINE,"  Hey, why don’t you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. She’ll love it.",5
1088,GEORGE," That’s exquisite. Listen, uh, if it’s not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?",5
1089,JERRY," You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.",5
1090,GEORGE, Up again?! This is incredible! I’m.. I’m getting it.,5
1091,ELAINE, You’re getting what?,5
1092,GEORGE, A stock.,5
1093,JERRY, What stock?,5
1094,GEORGE," Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?",5
1095,JERRY, Maybe.,5
1096,GEORGE," He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now he’s got some new thing. You know, there’s supposed to be a big merger. He wasn’t even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.",5
1097,JERRY, How high’s it suppose to go?,5
1098,GEORGE," I don’t know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?",5
1099,JERRY, Boy... I don’t know.,5
1100,ELAINE, I’d do it but I don’t have any money.,5
1101,JERRY, What kind of company is it?,5
1102,GEORGE, It’s called Sendrax. They’ve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.,5
1103,ELAINE, Televising opera?,5
1104,GEORGE, Some sort of electronic thingy.,5
1105,JERRY," Well, how much are you going to invest?",5
1106,GEORGE, Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand.,5
1107,JERRY, Boy...,5
1108,GEORGE, C’mon. Wilkinson’s got millions invested in this stock. It’s gone up three points since I’ve been watching it.,5
1109,JERRY, What if I lose it?,5
1110,GEORGE," C’mon, go for twenty-five hundred. We’ll do it together. Come on, come on. We’re in it together.",5
1111,JERRY, All right. Twenty-five hundred.,5
1112,GEORGE, That’s it.,5
1113,WAITRESS," Yeah, can I take your order?",5
1114,GEORGE,  Check the raiser.,5
1115,JERRY, My bet? All right. I’ll open with a tuna sandwich.,5
1116,ELAINE, Tuna?,5
1117,JERRY," Oh, the dolphin thing?",5
1118,ELAINE, They’re dying in the nets.,5
1119,JERRY," Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.",5
1120,ELAINE," Jerry, can’t you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?",5
1121,JERRY," Hey, when I’m driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. I’m always waving everybody in. “Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.” ...All right. All right. I’ll have a chicken salad.",5
1122,ELAINE, And I’m going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.,5
1123,WAITRESS, Okay.  What about you?,5
1124,GEORGE, I’ll have the tuna.,5
1125,JERRY," I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.",5
1126,VANESSA, Why didn’t you do something?,5
1127,JERRY," What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn.  Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll.  I mean, beyond that, I’m risking a punch in the mouth.  Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?",5
1128,STOCK BOY, No puffs. Just flakes.,5
1129,JERRY , Have you thought any more about that trip?,5
1130,VANESSA," Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it.",5
1131,JERRY," You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.",5
1132,VANESSA, I don’t know. I just worry about trips like this. It’s a lot of pressure.,5
1133,JERRY, It’s great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It’s like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish  three days.,5
1134,VANESSA," Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two?",5
1135,JERRY," Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.",5
1136,VANESSA, Really? Could we go fishing up there?,5
1137,JERRY," Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?",5
1138,VANESSA, They have marlin in Vermont?,5
1139,JERRY," Oh, big fighting marlin. ",5
1140,VANESSA," Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down.",5
1141,JERRY ," I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.",5
1142,JERRY, Is that my paper?,5
1143,KRAMER," Bad news, my friend.",5
1144,JERRY, What? What news?,5
1145,KRAMER , Sendrax.,5
1146,JERRY," Oh, c’mon! It’s down again?!",5
1147,KRAMER, Two and a half points.,5
1148,JERRY," Oh, I can’t believe it. Let me see that.  That’s four and a half points in three days! That’s almost half my money!",5
1149,KRAMER," Hey, I told you.",5
1150,JERRY,"  Yeah, you told me.",5
1151,KRAMER, It’s all manipulated with junk bonds. You can’t win.,5
1152,JERRY," There’s one thing I don’t understand. Why does it please you?  George Costanza, please.",5
1153,KRAMER," Hey, I don’t care. I’m just telling you to  get rid of that stock, now!",5
1154,JERRY,"  George, what’s going on?!",5
1155,KRAMER," Sell it, just say I’m selling!",5
1156,JERRY,"  Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my money’s gone... Well, call me right back.  Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasn’t been home or in his office in the past three days!",5
1157,KRAMER," You know, I can’t believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you could’ve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.",5
1158,JERRY, Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?,5
1159,KRAMER," Okay, you’re in a restaurant. You’ve got a very big meeting coming up...",5
1160,JERRY, Okay...,5
1161,KRAMER,"  Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!",5
1162,JERRY,  Oh No!,5
1163,KRAMER," You just  tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then you’re gone.",5
1164,JERRY, You’re gone all right.,5
1165,KRAMER,"  Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...",5
1166,JERRY," Yeah, I’m going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.",5
1167,KRAMER," Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.",5
1168,JERRY, What friends?,5
1169,KRAMER," Well, it’s just some people I met at a rock concert.  Do you mind if they use your bed?  ‘Cause they’re really good people, Jerry. I’m telling you. You know, they’re anarchists. They’re.. they’re.. they’re.. huge.",5
1170,JERRY," George- What?! You’re kidding... Well, what’s wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, I’ll speak to you later.  Wilkinson, the guy who’s supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, he’s in the hospital.",5
1171,JERRY, So you don’t know what’s wrong with him?,5
1172,GEORGE, All Simons was able to find out is that he’s in the hospital.,5
1173,JERRY," Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?",5
1174,GEORGE," Of course he’s been in touch with him. He’s left two messages. He just hasn’t heard back yet, that’s all.",5
1175,JERRY," Well, this is it. I’m selling.",5
1176,GEORGE, Just give it a little more time.,5
1177,JERRY, I never should’ve gotten involved in this. I’m a nervous wreck. I’m not cut out for investing.,5
1178,GEORGE," All right, all right. That’s it. I’m gonna go down there.",5
1179,JERRY, Where?,5
1180,GEORGE, To the hospital.,5
1181,JERRY, The hospital?,5
1182,GEORGE, I’m going to find out what’s going on. All right?,5
1183,JERRY, Are you nuts? You don’t even know the guy.,5
1184,GEORGE," So what? I’ll start talking to him, you know, casual, and I’ll work my way around to it.",5
1185,JERRY," What if he’s in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do?  “How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson?”  “By the way, what’s happening with Sendrax?”",5
1186,GEORGE, Maybe he’s resting.,5
1187,JERRY, Who goes to the hospital to rest?,5
1188,GEORGE," What are you, a doctor?",5
1189,JERRY," Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?",5
1190,GEORGE, Today. I’m going today. Just don’t do anything until you hear from me.,5
1191,JERRY, All right.,5
1192,GEORGE,"  Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.",5
1193,DRY CLEANER,  May I help you?,5
1194,JERRY, Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It’s completely shrunk. There’s absolutely no way I can wear it.,5
1195,DRY CLEANER, When did you bring it in?,5
1196,JERRY, What’s the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!,5
1197,DRY CLEANER, You got a receipt?,5
1198,JERRY, I can’t find the receipt.,5
1199,DRY CLEANER, You should get the receipt.,5
1200,JERRY," Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! It’s a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!",5
1201,DRY CLEANER," Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?",5
1202,JERRY," What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I don’t even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. That’s what I want. I want an admission of guilt.",5
1203,DRY CLEANER, Maybe you asked for it to be washed.,5
1204,JERRY, No! Dry-cleaned.,5
1205,DRY CLEANE," Let me explain to you something, okay? With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing-",5
1206,JERRY, You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!,5
1207,DRY CLEANER,  I shrunk it.,5
1208,JERRY," I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, “Well, it’s ruined.” And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, “It’s not our fault. We’re not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation.” You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? They’re cleaning our clothes, but they’re not getting anything wet. It’s all dry. I know there’s gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that they’re using. There’s no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that  That’s dry cleaning. I don’t think that’s what they’re doing back there. They don’t have eighty guys going, “Come on, hurry up! There’s a lot of shirts today!”",5
1209,JERRY, Bless you.,5
1210,ELAINE," Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they’re clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he can’t count to ten, so don’t give me hygiene.",5
1211,JERRY , So what are you gonna do?,5
1212,ELAINE," I don’t know. I can’t think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?",5
1213,JERRY," Well, it couldn’t be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?",5
1214,ELAINE," What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?",5
1215,JERRY, I’m no cat killer.,5
1216,ELAINE, How about we go over there right now and we shave them?,5
1217,JERRY," I’d really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.",5
1218,ELAINE, He actually went to the hospital?,5
1219,JERRY, Yeah.,5
1220,ELAINE," Oh man, he’s nuts.",5
1221,JERRY," Yeah, he’s nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats.  I know, I know. It’s down again.",5
1222,KRAMER, How much are you down altogether?,5
1223,JERRY, I don’t know.. fifteen hundred dollars.,5
1224,KRAMER, Wow.,5
1225,JERRY," You don’t have to say “Wow.” I know it’s “Wow.”  And there’s that smile again. Well, what is that?  It’s George.",5
1226,KRAMER," Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.",5
1227,JERRY, I really don’t need to look.,5
1228,KRAMER, What a body. Yeeaahh. That’s for me.,5
1229,JERRY," Yeah, and you’re just what she’s looking for too – a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.",5
1230,KRAMER, I’m gonna go down there and try and talk to her.,5
1231,JERRY, What? What? Did you go down there?  Did he tell you what’s gonna happen?  How long were you there?,5
1232,GEORGE, Fifteen seconds.,5
1233,JERRY, You told him you knew Simons?,5
1234,GEORGE," Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, I’m in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I’ll tell you one thing. I don’t know what he’s got. But for a sick guy, he’s very strong.",5
1235,JERRY," Well, that’s it. Look, I’m going to Vermont. I don’t want to think about this. I’m selling.",5
1236,ELAINE," Didn’t work, huh?",5
1237,GEORGE,  Not quite.,5
1238,ELAINE," We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?",5
1239,GEORGE, I’m keeping it. I’m going down with the ship.,5
1240,JERRY, So I know this guy. I’m getting all my sneakers at a discount now.,5
1241,VANESSA, I know. You mentioned it.,5
1242,JERRY," Oh yeah, right.",5
1243,JERRY,  Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I’ve still got another day! I’ve got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one.  That’s a nice watch. Do you wind it?,5
1244,VANESSA," No, it’s got a little battery.",5
1245,JERRY," Well, that’s good.",5
1246,JERRY,"  Well, the drive home should be a delight. I’m speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I don’t care.  That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?",5
1247,VANESSA," No, it’s okay.",5
1248,JERRY," So, I guess you don’t find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?",5
1249,VANESSA, Not especially.,5
1250,JERRY," Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?",5
1251,VANESSA, What can we do? It’s raining.,5
1252,JERRY, We cold play “Sorry!” We cold play “Steal the Old Man’s Bundle.”  Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself.  What kind of perfume is that you’re wearing?,5
1253,VANESSA," Oh, you’ve never heard of it.",5
1254,JERRY," No, what? What kind is it?",5
1255,VANESSA, I can’t tell you.,5
1256,JERRY,"  Yeah, that’s normal.  Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?",5
1257,VANESSA, That stock? I thought you got out of that?,5
1258,JERRY, I did. I’m just curious. It’s been almost a week. I want to check it out.  Six points?  It’s up six points!,5
1259,VANESSA, I told you not to sell.,5
1260,JERRY, You did not tell me not to sell.,5
1261,VANESSA, I said the market fluctuates. Remember?,5
1262,JERRY," Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!",5
1263,VANESSA, That’s probably why we're-,5
1264,JERRY, What?,5
1265,VANESSA, Forget it.,5
1266,JERRY," No, what? ‘That’s probably why..’",5
1267,VANESSA," That’s probably why we’re staying here, because you lost money on the stock.",5
1268,JERRY,"  So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...",5
1269,GEORGE,"  Have something else. C’mon, have a little dessert?",5
1270,JERRY ," I’m good, thanks.",5
1271,GEORGE," Elaine, get something! It’s all taken care of.",5
1272,ELAINE, I’m kinda full.,5
1273,GEORGE, So don’t finish it.,5
1274,JERRY,"  She’s full. So, Big Daddy. I’m just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?",5
1275,GEORGE, I don’t like to discuss figures.,5
1276,JERRY, How much?,5
1277,GEORGE," I don’t know, what? Eight thousand. It’s a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.",5
1278,JERRY," So, Wilkinson’s out of the hospital now?",5
1279,GEORGE , No. You’d be surprised. You don’t recover that quickly from a nose job.,5
1280,ELAINE, Oh god.,5
1281,JERRY, Is that still from the cats?,5
1282,ELAINE," No, I just have a cold.",5
1283,JERRY," So, what ever happened with that?",5
1284,ELAINE, I gave him an ultimatum.,5
1285,GEORGE, He chose the cats?,5
1286,ELAINE, They’re very clean animals.,5
1287,JERRY," I gotta say, that’s pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.",5
1288,ELAINE, Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.,5
1289,GEORGE," I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you can’t get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. You’d get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...",5
1290,ELAINE, Superman can go back in time?,5
1291,JERRY, We went over that.,5
1292,GEORGE," Pst.  Wilkinson’s got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. They’re about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.",5
1293,JERRY, A robot butcher?,5
1294,GEORGE," Shhhhh. If you want to get in, there’s very little time.  Sweetheart..  No, no, no. That ought to cover it.  Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek...  Come on, come on, come on...",5
1295,JERRY," I’m not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. I’ve decided I’ll do the work. I’m gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? ‘Cause you send your money out there – working for you – a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, “What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me.” “Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.”",5
1296,JERRY," I’m always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, “Is this the best lane for me? For my life?” They’re always a little bit ahead of you, “Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there?” “Yeah, come on over here, pal. We’re zoomin’ over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it.” The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday we’ll be going,  “Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. I’m gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.”",6
1297,GEORGE, She can’t kill me right?,6
1298,JERRY," No, of course not.",6
1299,GEORGE, People break up all the time.,6
1300,JERRY, Everyday.,6
1301,GEORGE, It just didn’t work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldn’t.,6
1302,JERRY, You tried.,6
1303,GEORGE," I kept looking at her face. I’d go, “C’mon, love her. Love her!”",6
1304,JERRY, Did you tell her you loved her?,6
1305,GEORGE," Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She’d tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. I’d go, “Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, that’s, that’s something.” But, eventually you have to come back with, “Well, I love you.” You know, you can only hold out for so long.”",6
1306,JERRY, You’re a human being.,6
1307,GEORGE, And I didn’t even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no?  I can’t do that to someone.,6
1308,JERRY, You’re too nice a guy.,6
1309,GEORGE," I am. I’m a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, I’m sitting on the couch, she’s on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, she’s on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldn’t do that. I would’ve insulted her.",6
1310,JERRY, You’re flesh and blood.,6
1311,GEORGE," I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didn’t want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. “This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father...” It’s like I’m in quicksand.",6
1312,JERRY, I told you when I met her.,6
1313,GEORGE, My back is killing me.,6
1314,JERRY," You gotta go to my chiropractor, he’s the best.",6
1315,GEORGE," Oh yeah, everybody’s guy is the best.",6
1316,JERRY, I’m gonna make an appointment for you. We’ll go together.,6
1317,GEORGE," Please. They don’t do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Can’t I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.",6
1318,JERRY, You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!,6
1319,ELAINE, Hi.,6
1320,JERRY, Hi.,6
1321,ELAINE," Hey, what are you doing?",6
1322,GEORGE, I’m letting you in.,6
1323,ELAINE, Oh no. No. I don’t want to sit in the back. I’ll be left out of the conversation.,6
1324,GEORGE," No, you won’t.",6
1325,ELAINE," Yes, I will, George. I’ll have to stick my chin on top of the seat.",6
1326,GEORGE, Okay.,6
1327,ELAINE, Why can’t you sit in the middle?,6
1328,GEORGE," Please, it doesn’t look good. Boy, boy, girl.",6
1329,ELAINE," You’re afraid to sit next to a man. You’re a little homophobic, aren’t ya?",6
1330,GEORGE, Is it that obvious?,6
1331,ELAINE," Hello, Jerry.",6
1332,JERRY, Hello.,6
1333,ELAINE, Did you get a haircut?,6
1334,JERRY," No, shower. So, where are we eating?",6
1335,ELAINE," Tell me if you think this is strange. There’s this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. He’s a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever we’d run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. He’s a nice guy, he’s got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, that’s where this relationship is finally gonna settle",6
1336,GEORGE,"  “You know, I’d go from nods to nothing...”",6
1337,ELAINE," And now, there’s this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, it’s like we really hate each other. It’s based on nothing.",6
1338,JERRY, A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in “The Blob”.,6
1339,GEORGE, I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.,6
1340,ELAINE, Really?,6
1341,GEORGE, Yes.,6
1342,ELAINE, You would do that?,6
1343,GEORGE, If I was a different person.,6
1344,JERRY," Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... I’m sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...",6
1345,KRAMER,  Come on up.,6
1346,JERRY,"  Oh, it’s you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldn’t have had to do this. Now that’s two long distance calls I made to you why can’t you...  Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.",6
1347,KRAMER, Taste this.,6
1348,JERRY," No, I just had a sandwich.",6
1349,KRAMER," No, taste it. Taste it.",6
1350,JERRY, I don’t want cantaloupe now.,6
1351,KRAMER, You’ve never had cantaloupe like this before...,6
1352,JERRY, I only eat cantaloupe at certain times...,6
1353,KRAMER, ...Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.,6
1354,JERRY, ...all right!,6
1355,KRAMER, Uh-huh. It’s good?,6
1356,JERRY, It’s very good.,6
1357,KRAMER," Good, huh?",6
1358,JERRY, Good.,6
1359,KRAMER, I got it at Joe’s.,6
1360,JERRY, Uh-huh.,6
1361,KRAMER, Forty-nine cents a pound. That’s practically half than what you’re paying at the supermarket. I don’t know why you don’t go to Joe’s.,6
1362,JERRY, It’s too far.,6
1363,KRAMER, It’s three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..,6
1364,JERRY," I’m not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll ‘em down below my knee?",6
1365,KRAMER," See, the other thing is, if you don’t like anything, he takes it right back.",6
1366,JERRY, I don’t return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.,6
1367,GEORGE, I’m outta there. I did it! It’s over.,6
1368,JERRY, You did it? What happened?,6
1369,GEORGE, I told her. In the kitchen – which was risky ‘cause it’s near all the knives. I started with the word “Listen.”,6
1370,JERRY, Uh-huh...,6
1371,GEORGE," I said, “Listen Marlene,” and then the next thing I know, I’m in the middle of it. And there’s this voice inside of me going, “You’re doing it! You’re doing it!” And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, “Keep going, keep going. You’re almost out!” It’s like I was making a prison break, you know, and I’m heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. She’s firing at me from the guard tower. “Son of a bang! Son of a boom!” I get to the top of the wall – the front door. I opened it up, I’m one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!",6
1372,JERRY," See, it’s never as bad as you imagine.",6
1373,KRAMER, I liked Marlene. What’s her number?,6
1374,GEORGE," Uh, no, I, I don’t think so.",6
1375,JERRY,  Could you stop that smacking?,6
1376,KRAMER," George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.",6
1377,GEORGE," Oh no, thank you.",6
1378,KRAMER, It’s the best cantaloupe I ever had.,6
1379,GEORGE," No, really. No, no, thanks.",6
1380,KRAMER," Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.",6
1381,JERRY, It’s very good cantaloupe.  So that’s it? You’re out?,6
1382,GEORGE," Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.",6
1383,JERRY," So, go get them.",6
1384,GEORGE," Oh, no no, I can’t go back there. Jerry, it’s so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, I’d be right back where I started from.",6
1385,JERRY, So forget about the books. Did you read them?,6
1386,GEORGE," Well, yeah.",6
1387,JERRY, What do you need them for?,6
1388,GEORGE, I don’t know. They’re books.,6
1389,JERRY, What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like they’re trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?,6
1390,GEORGE, They’re my books.,6
1391,JERRY, So you want me to get the books? Is that it?,6
1392,MARLENE," ...so, it must’ve been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyone’s just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and t-shirt. And I don’t know, I was just in one of those moods. So I said to myself, “Marlene, just do it.” And I jumped in. And as I’m getting out, I feel all these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me.",6
1393,JERRY, So what’d you do?,6
1394,MARLENE," Well, nothing. It’s no skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didn’t see what the big attraction was.",6
1395,JERRY," Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.",6
1396,MARLENE," Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I don’t see each other anymore, it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t stay friends.",6
1397,JERRY, No.,6
1398,MARLENE, Good enough. I’m really glad we got that settled.,6
1399,JERRY, I don’t know how this happened.,6
1400,GEORGE," Jerry, it’s not my fault.",6
1401,JERRY," No, no. It’s not your fault. “Books, books, I need my books.” Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, it’s not like Marlene’s a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, we’ve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling.  And it’s these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if I’m busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and she’s in the middle of a sentence!",6
1402,GEORGE, It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?,6
1403,JERRY,"  Ohh! You know, and sometimes she’ll go,  “Hello, Jerry?” And I’ll go, “Oh, hi Marlene.” And then it’s “Jerry...”",6
1404,GEORGE, What trying to get off the phone?,6
1405,JERRY,"  Ohhhh! You can’t! It’s impossible! There’s no break in the conversation where you can go, “All right then...” You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.",6
1406,GEORGE, Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off!  She is sexy though. Don’t you think?,6
1407,JERRY," Yeah. Yes, she is.",6
1408,RECEPTIONIST, Mr. Costanza?,6
1409,GEORGE, Yeah.,6
1410,RECEPTIONIST, The doctor will see you now.,6
1411,GEORGE,"  Yeah, doctor. I’m going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, aren’t I?  I better take this. I hate the little room.  “Oh, hello, Doctor.”",6
1412,JERRY," The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. ‘Cause it says “Waiting Room.” There’s no chance of not waiting. ‘Cause they call it the waiting room, they’re gonna use it. They’ve got it. It’s all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and you’ve got your little magazine. You pretend you’re reading it, but you’re really looking at the other people. You know, you’re thinking about about them. Things like, “I wonder what he’s got. As soon as she goes, I’m getting her magazine.” And then, they finally call you and it’s a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. “Well, I guess I’ve been chosen. I’ll see you all later.” You know, so you think you’re going to see the doctor, but you’re not, are you? No. You’re going into the next waiting room – the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You don’t wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You don’t want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, “I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in?” Do they scalp tickets to these things? “I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...”",6
1413,JERRY," So, how was it?",6
1414,GEORGE," I was in there for two minutes. He didn’t do anything. Touch this, feel that – seventy-five bucks!",6
1415,JERRY," Well, it’s a first visit.",6
1416,GEORGE," What’s seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I don’t understand this. I’m only paying half.",6
1417,JERRY, You can’t do that.,6
1418,GEORGE, Why not?,6
1419,JERRY, He’s a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.,6
1420,GEORGE," Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.",6
1421,MARLENE, Are you feeling weird?,6
1422,JERRY," No, I’m fine.",6
1423,MARLENE, Nothing really happened.,6
1424,JERRY," Yeah, I know.",6
1425,MARLENE, We just kissed a little. People kiss.,6
1426,JERRY, Yeah.,6
1427,MARLENE, Well... night.,6
1428,JERRY,  Good night.,6
1429,KRAMER, Hey.,6
1430,JERRY, Hey.,6
1431,KRAMER," I got it! This time, I got it!",6
1432,JERRY , All right.,6
1433,KRAMER," Hips! See, it’s all hips.",6
1434,JERRY, Uh-huh.,6
1435,KRAMER, You gotta come through with the hips first.,6
1436,JERRY, That is out there.,6
1437,KRAMER, Joe’s?,6
1438,JERRY," No, supermarket.",6
1439,KRAMER," Well, is it good?",6
1440,JERRY, It’s uh okay.,6
1441,KRAMER, Let me taste it.,6
1442,KRAMER," See, that stinks. You can’t eat that. You should take that back.",6
1443,JERRY, I’m not taking it back.,6
1444,KRAMER," All right, I’ll take it back. I’m going by there.",6
1445,JERRY, I don’t care about it.,6
1446,KRAMER," Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.",6
1447,JERRY, All right. Take it back.,6
1448,MARLENE,"  Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If I’m not talking into the soap right now, call me back.",6
1449,KRAMER, Well?,6
1450,JERRY, Marlene.,6
1451,KRAMER,"  Oh. Oh, Marlene...",6
1452,JERRY," Yeah, I took her home one night – we kinda started up a little bit in the car.",6
1453,KRAMER, I thought you were trying to get rid of her?,6
1454,JERRY," I was. But, she’s got me, like, hypnotized.",6
1455,KRAMER, Does George know?,6
1456,JERRY," No, he’d go nuts.",6
1457,KRAMER," Yeah, no kidding.",6
1458,JERRY," I feel terrible.  I mean, I’ve seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can’t go any further, but... She’s just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I can’t breathe. It’s like a drug.",6
1459,KRAMER," Whoa, psychosexual.",6
1460,JERRY, I don’t know how I’m going to tell him.,6
1461,KRAMER," Man, I don’t understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?",6
1462,JERRY," It’s partially you, yeah.",6
1463,KRAMER, You’re his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesn’t even know?,6
1464,JERRY," Well, he can’t kill me, right?",6
1465,KRAMER, You’re a human being.,6
1466,JERRY," I mean, she called me. I haven’t called her. She started it.",6
1467,KRAMER, You’re flesh and blood.,6
1468,JERRY, I’m a nice guy.,6
1469,ELAINE, Hi.,6
1470,JERRY,"  Oh, my little airplane lamp.",6
1471,ELAINE," You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. That’s hard to get used to when you’re in so many other fast ones.",6
1472,JERRY," Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don’t have to be home on time.",6
1473,ELAINE, Unless you’re married to a dictator.,6
1474,JERRY, Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.,6
1475,ELAINE, Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebody’s going to offer me some cantaloupe?,6
1476,KRAMER, Nope. No good.,6
1477,JERRY," Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.",6
1478,KRAMER," Well, I’m taking this back.",6
1479,ELAINE," So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.",6
1480,JERRY, Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?,6
1481,ELAINE, Yes.,6
1482,JERRY, You talked to him?,6
1483,ELAINE," Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, “No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.”",6
1484,JERRY, Right.,6
1485,ELAINE," So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, “Hi, remember me?” And he furrows his brow, as if he’s really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, “You little phony. You know exactly who I am.”",6
1486,JERRY," You said ""you little phony""?",6
1487,ELAINE," I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, “Oh, yeah. You’re Jeanette’s friend. We did meet once.” And I said, “Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?”",6
1488,JERRY, This is amazing.,6
1489,ELAINE," And he says, he says, “Look, I just didn’t want to say hello anymore, All right?” And I said, “Fine. Fine. I didn’t want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that I’m aware of it!”",6
1490,JERRY," You are the Queen of Confrontation. You’re my new hero. In fact, you’ve inspired me. I’m gonna call George about something right now.",6
1491,ELAINE, This cantaloupe stinks.,6
1492,GEORGE,  I don’t care.,6
1493,JERRY, You’re kidding.,6
1494,GEORGE," No, I don’t care.",6
1495,JERRY, You mean that?,6
1496,GEORGE, Absolutely.,6
1497,JERRY, You don’t care?,6
1498,GEORGE, No.,6
1499,JERRY, How could you not care?,6
1500,GEORGE, I don’t know. But I don’t. I’m actually almost happy to hear it.,6
1501,JERRY, I thought you’d be upset.,6
1502,GEORGE," I guess I should be, but I’m not.",6
1503,JERRY, Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?,6
1504,GEORGE, You’re a fine person. You’re a humanitarian. She’s very sexy.,6
1505,JERRY, That voice. That voice. She’s driving me crazy.,6
1506,GEORGE, I know. I know.,6
1507,JERRY," So I can see her tonight, and you don’t care?",6
1508,GEORGE, See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. She’s too crazy for me.,6
1509,JERRY, All right. As long as you’re okay. Because I can’t stop thinking about her.,6
1510,GEORGE, I’m okay. I’m fine. I’m wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.,6
1511,JERRY, Good. And I’ll tell you what... You don’t have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.,6
1512,GEORGE,  You paid that crook?!,6
1513,JERRY, I had to.,6
1514,GEORGE," He didn’t do anything, Jerry. It’s a scam! Who told you to do that?",6
1515,JERRY, It was embarrassing to me.,6
1516,GEORGE," Oh, I was trying to make a point.",6
1517,JERRY, Why don’t you make a point with your own doctor?  What’s wrong?,6
1518,GEORGE,  I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do?  What can happen?!,6
1519,JERRY," So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?",6
1520,MARLENE," I’m sorry, Jerry. I just don’t think this is gonna work.",6
1521,JERRY, Really? I thought...,6
1522,MARLENE," I know, I’m sorry.",6
1523,JERRY," Gee, I just didn’t expect it from the way you’ve been acting.",6
1524,MARLENE, You sure you want to talk about this? ‘Cause I sure don’t.,6
1525,JERRY, Of course I want to talk about it.,6
1526,MARLENE," Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.",6
1527,JERRY, Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?,6
1528,MARLENE, I saw your act.,6
1529,JERRY, My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?,6
1530,MARLENE," Well, to be honest, it just didn’t make it for me. It’s just so much fluff.",6
1531,JERRY," I can’t believe this. So what are you saying? You didn’t like my act, so that’s it?",6
1532,MARLENE, I can’t be with someone if I don’t respect what they do.,6
1533,JERRY, You’re a cashier!,6
1534,MARLENE," Look, Jerry, it’s just wasn't my kind of humor.",6
1535,JERRY, You can’t go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.,6
1536,MARLENE, I heard the material.,6
1537,JERRY, I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.,6
1538,JERRY," Women need to like the job of the guy they’re with. If they don’t like the job, they don’t like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. “Well, right now, I’m the regional management supervisor. I’m in development, research, consulting...” Men on the other hand – if they are physically attracted to a woman – are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men don’t really care. Men’ll just go, “Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? You’re just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why don’t you shower up, and we’ll get some burgers and catch a movie.”",6
1539,JERRY," My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didn’t want to move to Florida, but they’re in their sixties, and that’s the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old people’s house with a golf cart, jump out, “Let’s go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it!” I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversation’s so boring. It’s so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, “What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass.” You know. Come back in, there’s broken glass, everybody’s all upset. “No, I’m all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, I’m fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Let’s pick it up right there.”",7
1540,HELEN," You have so many nice jackets. I don’t know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? What’s wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you can’t wear this!",7
1541,MORTY, Are you getting that?,7
1542,HELEN, I thought you were getting it.,7
1543,MORTY, Should I pick up?,7
1544,HELEN, You want me to get that?,7
1545,MORTY, I’ll get it!,7
1546,HELEN, I’ll get it!,7
1547,HELEN, Hello?... Hello?,7
1548,JERRY, Hi.,7
1549,HELEN, Hi.,7
1550,JERRY,  Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!,7
1551,MORTY," So, how’d you do?",7
1552,JERRY, We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We’ll be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.,7
1553,HELEN, This is your greatest moment? A game?,7
1554,JERRY," Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.",7
1555,MORTY," You know what my greatest moment was, don’t you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat.",7
1556,HELEN," Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?",7
1557,JERRY," Well, the man’s an individualist – he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what he’s doing.",7
1558,HELEN, But it’s their 50th anniversary.,7
1559,MORTY, Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.,7
1560,HELEN," You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.",7
1561,JERRY," First of all, I made plans with Elaine.",7
1562,HELEN, So bring her.,7
1563,JERRY," I don’t even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, I’ve met them three times in my life.",7
1564,MORTY," I don’t know her either.  She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.",7
1565,HELEN," At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you’ll leave.",7
1566,MORTY, How come he gets to leave?,7
1567,JERRY," If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He’s always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it’s because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.",7
1568,MORTY," And it’s always about Jeffrey, right?",7
1569,JERRY, Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.,7
1570,KRAMER," Morty, are you coming in?",7
1571,MORTY," Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.",7
1572,KRAMER,"  Hey, how’d you do?",7
1573,JERRY, We won. We’re in the finals on Wednesday.,7
1574,KRAMER, Yeah!,7
1575,JERRY,  What is this about?,7
1576,KRAMER, I’m completely changing the configuration of the apartment. You’re not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.,7
1577,JERRY, What are you doing?,7
1578,KRAMER, Levels.,7
1579,JERRY, Levels?,7
1580,KRAMER," Yeah, I’m getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And I’m going to build these different levels, with steps, and it’ll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.",7
1581,JERRY, You drew up plans for this?,7
1582,KRAMER, No no. It’s all in my head.,7
1583,MORTY, I don’t know how you’re going to be comfortable like that.,7
1584,KRAMER," Oh, I’ll be comfortable.",7
1585,JERRY, When do you intend to do this?,7
1586,KRAMER, Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.,7
1587,JERRY, You’re doing this yourself?,7
1588,KRAMER," It’s a simple job. Why, you don’t think I can?",7
1589,JERRY," Oh, no. It’s not that I don’t think you can. I know that you can’t, and I’m positive that you won’t.",7
1590,KRAMER," Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.",7
1591,MORTY," Hey, that’s some big job.",7
1592,JERRY," I, don’t see it happening.",7
1593,KRAMER," Well, this time, this time you’re wrong. C’mon. I’ll even bet you.",7
1594,JERRY, Seriously?,7
1595,HELEN," I don’t want you betting. Morty, don’t let him bet.",7
1596,KRAMER, A big dinner with dessert. But I’ve got till the end of the month.,7
1597,JERRY, I’ll give you a year.,7
1598,KRAMER, No no no. End of the month.,7
1599,JERRY, It’s a bet.,7
1600,JERRY,"  Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?",7
1601,ELAINE," No, no. I’m fine.",7
1602,UNCLE LEO," Jerry, are you listening to this?",7
1603,JERRY," Yeah, Uncle Leo.",7
1604,UNCLE LEO," So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.",7
1605,JERRY, Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?,7
1606,UNCLE LEO," No, for the walking tours.",7
1607,JERRY," Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.",7
1608,UNCLE LEO," That’s exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours he’s talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?",7
1609,JERRY, Mickey Mantle?,7
1610,ELAINE,"  Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas?  These peas are great!",7
1611,JERRY,  These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.,7
1612,ELAINE, Mmm... phenomenal peas.,7
1613,MORTY, Are you ready for dessert?,7
1614,JERRY," Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.",7
1615,MANYA,  You’re going?,7
1616,ELAINE," Oh uh, I don’t really eat dessert. I’m dieting.",7
1617,JERRY," Yeah, I can’t eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can’t dance.",7
1618,MANYA , Can’t dance?,7
1619,HELEN," He’s kidding, Manya.",7
1620,MANYA, Is that a joke?,7
1621,HELEN," So, did you hear Claire’s getting married?",7
1622,MANYA," Yeah, yeah..",7
1623,HELEN," I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.",7
1624,JERRY, Horses? They’re like big riding dogs.,7
1625,ELAINE, What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...,7
1626,JERRY," I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.",7
1627,MANYA,  I had a pony.,7
1628,JERRY," Well, I didn’t uh really mean a pony, per se...",7
1629,MANYA," When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony... So, what’s wrong with that?",7
1630,JERRY, Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...,7
1631,HELEN, Should we have coffee? Who’s having coffee?,7
1632,MANYA, He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.,7
1633,JERRY," Well, I’m sure you did. Who wouldn’t love a pony? Who wouldn’t love a person that had a pony?",7
1634,MANYA, You! You said so!,7
1635,JERRY," No, see, we didn’t have ponies. I’m sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..",7
1636,MANYA, That’s it! I had enough!,7
1637,ISAAC," Have your coffee, everybody. She’s a little upset. It’s been an emotional day.",7
1638,JERRY," I didn’t know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrant’s going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin’ on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesn’t make sense. Am I wrong?",7
1639,JERRY, I’ll drive you to the airport.,7
1640,HELEN," No, we’re taking a cab.",7
1641,JERRY, I just hope that whole pony incident didn’t put a damper on the trip.,7
1642,HELEN, Don’t be ridiculous. It was a misunderstanding.,7
1643,MORTY," Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.",7
1644,JERRY," Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I’m sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.",7
1645,HELEN," You know, you should give Manya a call.",7
1646,JERRY, Maybe I will.,7
1647,KRAMER," Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.",7
1648,KRAMER, Need any help with those?,7
1649,MORTY," It’s nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?",7
1650,KRAMER," Oh, well... I decided I’m not gonna do it.",7
1651,JERRY,  Really? What a shock.,7
1652,HELEN," Goodbye, Jerry.",7
1653,JERRY, Take care.,7
1654,HELEN, We’ll call you.,7
1655,MORTY," Bye, Jer.",7
1656,JERRY," Bye, Dad. Take it easy.",7
1657,MORTY," Bye, Mr. Kramer.",7
1658,KRAMER," Yeah. So long, Morty.",7
1659,JERRY," So, when do I get my dinner?",7
1660,KRAMER, There’s no dinner. The bet’s off. I’m not gonna do it.,7
1661,JERRY," Yes, I know you’re not gonna do it. That’s why I bet.",7
1662,KRAMER," Ya well, there’s no bet if I’m not doing it.",7
1663,JERRY, That’s the bet! That you’re not doing it!,7
1664,KRAMER," Yeah, well, I could do it. I don’t wanna do it.",7
1665,JERRY, We didn’t bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.,7
1666,KRAMER, And it could be done.,7
1667,JERRY," Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if it’s done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!",7
1668,KRAMER, I don’t want the levels!,7
1669,JERRY," That’s the bet!  Hello?... No- oh, hi...  no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch ‘em.  Ma! Ma! Up here! Don’t get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!",7
1670,HELEN, Who did you talk to?,7
1671,JERRY, Uncle Leo.,7
1672,HELEN, And when’s the funeral?,7
1673,JERRY, I don’t know. He said he’d call back.,7
1674,MORTY," You know what this means, don’t you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.",7
1675,HELEN, She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...,7
1676,JERRY, What?,7
1677,HELEN, What? Nothing.,7
1678,JERRY, You don’t think... What? The pony remark?,7
1679,HELEN," Oh, don’t be ridiculous. She was an old woman.",7
1680,JERRY, You don’t think that I killed her?,7
1681,MORTY, You know what the flight back’ll cost us?,7
1682,JERRY, It was just an innocent comment! I didn’t know she had a pony!,7
1683,MORTY," Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.",7
1684,JERRY, The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke.  That’s probably Uncle Leo.,7
1685,HELEN," Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, it’s just one of those things... Sure, sure, we’ll see you then.",7
1686,HELEN, The funeral’s Wednesday.,7
1687,JERRY," Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?",7
1688,HELEN," Two o’ clock, Wednesday.",7
1689,JERRY, Ah,7
1690,HELEN, What?,7
1691,JERRY, I’ve got the softball game on Wednesday. It’s the championship.,7
1692,HELEN, So? You’re not obligated. Go play in your game.,7
1693,JERRY, I didn’t even know the woman.,7
1694,HELEN, So don’t go.,7
1695,JERRY, I mean I met her three times. I don’t even know her last name.,7
1696,HELEN," Jerry, no one’s forcing you.",7
1697,JERRY," I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That’s what I want to know. I mean, it’s the championship, I’m hitting everything.",7
1698,HELEN, I don’t have a dress to wear.  And you. You don’t have anything.,7
1699,MORTY, I got my sport jacket.,7
1700,HELEN, You’re not wearing that to a funeral.,7
1701,MORTY, What’s wrong with it?,7
1702,HELEN, It looks ridiculous.,7
1703,MORTY, What? I’m gonna buy a new sport jacket now?,7
1704,JERRY, I don’t know what to do.,7
1705,MORTY,  You know what this funeral’s gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!,7
1706,JERRY," We don’t understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you can’t stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I don’t see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, let’s make up our mind where we think they’re going.",7
1707,ELAINE, I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What time’s your game?,7
1708,JERRY, Two Forty-Five.,7
1709,ELAINE, And what time’s the funeral?,7
1710,JERRY, Two o’ clock.,7
1711,ELAINE, How long does a funeral take?,7
1712,JERRY," Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.",7
1713,ELAINE, So you can’t do both?,7
1714,JERRY," You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn’t expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.",7
1715,ELAINE, How can you even consider not going?,7
1716,GEORGE," You know, I’ve been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I’ll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How’s it gonna happen? I just don’t see how it could occur.",7
1717,ELAINE," You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I’m actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.",7
1718,GEORGE," They always make me take stock of my life. And how I’ve pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.",7
1719,JERRY," I know, and then you say to yourself, “From this moment on, I’m not gonna waste any more of it.” But then you go, “How? What can I do that’s not wasting it?”",7
1720,ELAINE, Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can’t you have coffee with people?,7
1721,GEORGE," You know, I can’t believe you’re even considering not playing. We need you. You’re hitting everything.",7
1722,ELAINE, He has to go. He may have killed her.,7
1723,JERRY, Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.,7
1724,ELAINE," Oh, yeah, but I didn’t say I hated anyone who had one.",7
1725,GEORGE,  Who’s going to play left field?,7
1726,JERRY, Bender.,7
1727,GEORGE," Bender? He can’t play left. He stinks. I just don’t see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care who’s at their funeral? They don’t even know they’re having a funeral. It’s not like she’s hanging out in the back going, “I can’t believe Jerry didn’t show up.”",7
1728,ELAINE, Maybe she’s there in spirit. How about that?,7
1729,GEORGE," If you’re a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think she’s gonna wanna hang around Drexler’s funeral home on Ocean Parkway?",7
1730,ELAINE," George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.",7
1731,GEORGE, You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It’s not like getting on a bus. One second.  It’s all mental.,7
1732,JERRY, Fifty years they were married. Now he’s moving to Pheonix.,7
1733,ELAINE, Phoenix? What’s happening with his appartment?,7
1734,JERRY," I don’t know. They’ve been in there since, like, World War II. The rent’s three hundred a month.",7
1735,ELAINE," Three hundred a month? Oh, my God.",7
1736,EULOGIST," Although this may seem like a sad event, it should not be a day of mourning. For Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world – a simpler world – with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony.  Oh, how she loved that pony. Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. It’s lustrous coat, it’s flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow.",7
1737,JERRY," Well, the game’s starting just about now.",7
1738,HELEN, It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.,7
1739,NEPHEW," I’m not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. I’m just an intern. I can’t write a note to an airline.",7
1740,MORTY, You’ve got your degree. They don’t care. They just want to see something.,7
1741,JERRY, I just wanted to say how sorry I was...,7
1742,UNCLE LEO," Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. They’re transferring him to Riverside - so he’ll completely revamp that operation, you understand?",7
1743,JERRY, Yeah.,7
1744,UNCLE LEO," He’ll do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, that’s your cousin.",7
1745,MORTY," You don’t understand, I’ve never paid a full fare.",7
1746,JERRY," Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.",7
1747,ELAINE," Oh, me too.",7
1748,ISAAC," Oh, no no no. She forgot all about that. She was much more upset about the potato salad.",7
1749,ELAINE," So, I understand you’re moving to Phoenix?",7
1750,ISAAC," Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya would’ve liked Phoenix.",7
1751,ELAINE," Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, what’s happening with your apartment?",7
1752,ISAAC, Of course it’s very hot there. I’ll have to get uh air conditioner.,7
1753,ELAINE," Oh, you can have mine. I’ll ship it out to you.  But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?",7
1754,ISAAC, Although they say it’s a dry heat.,7
1755,ELAINE," Dry, wet...  what’s happening with your apartment?",7
1756,ISAAC, I don’t even know if I should take my winter clothing.,7
1757,ELAINE," I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and I’ll watch it for you and I’ll live there and I’ll make sure that nothing happens to it.",7
1758,ISAAC," Oh, the apartment. Jeffrey’s taking the apartment.",7
1759,ELAINE," Oh, Jeffrey.",7
1760,JERRY, You know Jeffery?,7
1761,ELAINE ," Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.",7
1762,HELEN, It’s raining.,7
1763,JERRY, It’s raining? It’s raining. The game will be postponed. We’ll play tomorrow.,7
1764,MORTY," Believe me, I wouldn’t bother you if the army hadn’t closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.",7
1765,NEPHEW, I can’t. I’ll get in trouble.,7
1766,MORTY," Oh, for God’s sake!",7
1767,GEORGE, Who gets picked off in softball? It’s unheard of.,7
1768,JERRY, It’s never happened to me before.,7
1769,ELAINE," I remember saying to myself, “Why is Jerry so far off the base?”",7
1770,JERRY, I’ll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.,7
1771,GEORGE," And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?",7
1772,JERRY, I thought there were two outs.,7
1773,ELAINE, I couldn’t believe it when I saw you running.  I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.,7
1774,JERRY , It was the single worst moment of my life.,7
1775,GEORGE,  What about Sharon Besser?,7
1776,JERRY," Oh, well, of course. Nineteen-seventy-three.",7
1777,ELAINE," Makes you wonder, though, doesn’t it?",7
1778,JERRY, Wonder about what?,7
1779,ELAINE, You know...  the spirit world.,7
1780,JERRY, You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?,7
1781,ELAINE, I never saw anyone play like that.,7
1782,JERRY, But I went to the funeral.,7
1783,ELAINE," Yeah, but that doesn’t make up for killin’ her.",7
1784,GEORGE, Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.,7
1785,JERRY, Don’t you think she woulda heard I was there?,7
1786,GEORGE, Not necessarily.,7
1787,JERRY, Who figures and immigrant’s gonna have a pony?,7
1788,JERRY," What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police don’t use them for, you know, crowd control.  “Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, I’m talking to you. Behind the barricades!” So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldn’t it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... “Baltic, that’s two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, that’s it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.”",7
1789,JERRY," I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I can’t stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion won’t even exist. It won’t. I think eventually we’ll all be wearing the same thing. ‘Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where there’s people from the future or another planet, they’re all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, “This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. That’s it.” We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, “That was nice. I could wear that.”",8
1790,JERRY , I think I’ve seen enough.,8
1791,SALESMAN," Well, I might have something in the back.",8
1792,ELAINE," The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, they’d put it out in the front.",8
1793,JERRY," Why don’t they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, “Just Back.” All back; No front. You walk in the front, you’re immediately in the back.  Look, Elaine, tie carwash.",8
1794,CUSTOMER," Oh, I just read that. That’s terrific.",8
1795,JERRY,  Her father wrote that.,8
1796,CUSTOMER, Alton Benes is your father?,8
1797,ELAINE, Yeah.,8
1798,CUSTOMER, I always felt he deserved a wider audience.,8
1799,ELAINE, I’m not so sure he wants one.,8
1800,ELAINE," Hey, don’t forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight o’clock.",8
1801,JERRY, I guess I’m coming. I mean...,8
1802,ELAINE," What? What, you don’t want to go now?",8
1803,JERRY," No, I’ll go. I’m going.",8
1804,ELAINE," No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven’t seen my father in a while and... you know...",8
1805,JERRY," I’m worried I won’t be able to talk to him. He’s such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.",8
1806,ELAINE," So, that’s why we’re not together anymore.",8
1807,JERRY, What is this?,8
1808,JERRY, This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.,8
1809,ELAINE, Try it on.,8
1810,ELAINE," Wow, this is soft suede.",8
1811,JERRY, This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.,8
1812,JERRY, How much is it?,8
1813,ELAINE,  Oh my God.,8
1814,JERRY, Bad?  Very bad?,8
1815,ELAINE, You have no idea.,8
1816,JERRY, I have some idea.,8
1817,ELAINE, No idea.,8
1818,JERRY, I’ve got a ballpark.,8
1819,ELAINE, There is no park and the team has relocated.,8
1820,JERRY, Let me see that.  That is high.,8
1821,ELAINE," Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.",8
1822,JERRY, What’s with the pink lining and the candy stripes?,8
1823,ELAINE," Well, it’s just a lining. You can always have it changed.",8
1824,JERRY," Should I get it? I hate these moments. I’m hearing the dual voices now, you know, “What about the money?” “What’s money?”",8
1825,SALESMAN, It looks wonderful on you.,8
1826,JERRY, Hey.,8
1827,KRAMER, Hey. New jacket?,8
1828,JERRY, What do you think?,8
1829,KRAMER, It’s beautiful.,8
1830,JERRY, Is it me?,8
1831,KRAMER, That’s definitely you.,8
1832,JERRY, Really?,8
1833,KRAMER," That’s more you than you’ve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?",8
1834,JERRY, I don’t know. It’s got a pink lining.,8
1835,KRAMER," Oh... So, what did you pay for this?",8
1836,JERRY , I paid what it costs.,8
1837,KRAMER, How much?,8
1838,JERRY, What’s the difference?,8
1839,KRAMER," What, you’re not gonna tell me?",8
1840,JERRY, I’d rather not say it out loud. It’s embarrassing.,8
1841,KRAMER, Over three hundred?,8
1842,JERRY," Yes, but let’s just stop it right there.",8
1843,KRAMER, It’s over four hundred?,8
1844,JERRY ," Really, I’m not answering anymore.",8
1845,KRAMER, Is it over four hundred?,8
1846,JERRY, Would you?,8
1847,KRAMER," Woah, Nelson!",8
1848,JERRY," I know, I know.",8
1849,KRAMER, What are you gonna do with the leather one?,8
1850,JERRY, I don’t know.,8
1851,KRAMER," Well, are you gonna wear it?",8
1852,JERRY, Maybe.,8
1853,KRAMER, You’re not going to wear this.,8
1854,JERRY, Do you want it?,8
1855,KRAMER," Well, yeah. Okay. I’ll take it. I like the jacket.",8
1856,JERRY," Okay, take it.",8
1857,KRAMER," Heey, good karma for you.  Oh baby.",8
1858,GEORGE,  “Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...”,8
1859,JERRY, What is that song?,8
1860,GEORGE," Oh, it’s from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I can’t get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. I’m singin’ it on elevators, buses. I’m singin’ it in front of clients. It’s taken over my life.",8
1861,JERRY," You know, Schumann went mad from that.",8
1862,GEORGE, Artie Schuman? From Camp Hatchapee?,8
1863,JERRY," No, you idiot.",8
1864,GEORGE," What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin’ me an idiot?",8
1865,JERRY, You don’t know Robert Schumann? The composer?,8
1866,GEORGE," Oh, Schumann. Of course.",8
1867,JERRY, He went crazy from one note. He couldn’t get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.,8
1868,GEORGE," Really?  Well, what if it doesn’t stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Let’s just go, All right? I can’t believe we’re having dinner with Alton Benes.",8
1869,JERRY," I know exactly what’s gonna happen tonight. I’m gonna try and act like I’m not impressed, he’s gonna see right through it.",8
1870,GEORGE," Yeah, he’ll be looking at us like he’s backstage at a puppet show.",8
1871,JERRY, Let me just get my jacket.,8
1872,GEORGE, “Master of the house/Keeper of the inn...”  This is huge! When did this happen?,8
1873,JERRY," Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, it’s with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might’ve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.",8
1874,GEORGE, Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.,8
1875,JERRY, Absolutely.,8
1876,GEORGE, It’s fabulous.,8
1877,JERRY, I know.,8
1878,GEORGE," And I’ll tell you something else, I’m not even going to ask you. I want to know. But I’m not gonna ask. You’ll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this?  Over six? Can’t be seven. Don’t tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what you’re saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I won’t say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine.  I’m walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different.  Oh, ho! All right! I’ll tell you what, if you don’t say anything in the next five seconds, I’ll know it was over a thousand.",8
1879,KRAMER,"  Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?",8
1880,JERRY," Well, what kind of solid?",8
1881,KRAMER, I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it’s double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.,8
1882,JERRY, Birds?,8
1883,KRAMER," Yeah. A friend of mine, he’s a magician. He’s going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.",8
1884,JERRY, So take a cab.,8
1885,KRAMER, They won’t take a cage full of birds.,8
1886,JERRY, I can’t. I’m on my way out. There’s no way I can do it.,8
1887,KRAMER," George, do me a solid? Two minutes.",8
1888,GEORGE," Well, I’m going with him. I’d like to... I’ve never done a ‘solid’ before.",8
1889,KRAMER," All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.",8
1890,JERRY,"  Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.",8
1891,GEORGE,  “Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...”,8
1892,JERRY, Schumann.  Where are they?,8
1893,GEORGE, Maybe he didn’t show up.,8
1894,JERRY," What, you don’t want to do this?",8
1895,GEORGE," I don’t think there’s ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up.  Wait a second, is that him?",8
1896,JERRY," Yeah, I think it is.  Where’s Elaine?",8
1897,GEORGE, I’m nervous.,8
1898,JERRY,  Excuse me. Mister Benes?,8
1899,ALTON, Yeah?,8
1900,JERRY," I’m Jerry, Elaine’s friend, and this is George.",8
1901,GEORGE," It’s a great thrill to meet you, Sir.",8
1902,ALTON, Sit down. Want a drink?,8
1903,JERRY, Sure.,8
1904,ALTON, What’ll you have?,8
1905,JERRY,  I’ll have a cranberry juice with two limes.,8
1906,GEORGE," And, I’ll have a club soda with no ice.",8
1907,BENES, I’ll have another Scotch with plenty of ice.,8
1908,GEORGE, You like ice?,8
1909,ALTON, Huh?,8
1910,GEORGE," I said, do you like ice?",8
1911,ALTON, Like it?,8
1912,GEORGE, Don’t you think you get more without it?,8
1913,ALTON, Where’s Elaine?,8
1914,JERRY," Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She’s usually pretty punctual. Don’t you find that, George?",8
1915,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. She’s punctual... and uh she’s been late, sometimes.",8
1916,JERRY," Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she’s on time, and... sometimes she’s late.",8
1917,GEORGE, I guess...  today she’s late.,8
1918,JERRY, It appears that way.,8
1919,GEORGE, Yup.,8
1920,JERRY, Yup.,8
1921,ALTON, Looks like rain.,8
1922,GEORGE," I know, I know, that’s what they said.",8
1923,ALTON, Who said?,8
1924,GEORGE," The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.",8
1925,ALTON, I don’t need anybody to tell me it’s gonna rain.,8
1926,GEORGE," No, of course not. I didn’t-",8
1927,ALTON, All I have to do is stick my head out the window.  Which one’s suppose to be the funny guy?,8
1928,GEORGE,"  Oh, he’s the comedian.",8
1929,JERRY, I’m just a regular person.,8
1930,GEORGE," No, no. He’s just being modest.",8
1931,ALTON, We had a funny guy with us in Korea. Tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. There’s nothing funny about that.,8
1932,JERRY, Would you excuse me a minute? I’m gonna go to the bathroom. I’ll be right back.,8
1933,GEORGE, I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.,8
1934,ALTON, Drivel.,8
1935,GEORGE," Yea, well, maybe some parts.",8
1936,ALTON,  What parts?,8
1937,GEORGE," The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized – I have to make a phone call. I-I can’t believe- Would you-",8
1938,GEORGE, Thank you for leaving me alone with him!,8
1939,JERRY, That was brutal. I can’t go back out there.,8
1940,GEORGE," Well, let’s just leave.",8
1941,JERRY, Elaine’ll kill me.,8
1942,GEORGE, Where is she?,8
1943,JERRY, She’s gotta be here soon.,8
1944,GEORGE," How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and that’s it! I’m leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.",8
1945,JERRY, The waiter was trembling!,8
1946,GEORGE," If she doesn’t show up, we can’t possibly have dinner with him alone.",8
1947,JERRY, How are we gonna get out of it?,8
1948,GEORGE, We’ll say we’re frightened and we have to go home.,8
1949,JERRY," Yeah, that’s good. He’d clunk our heads together like Moe.",8
1950,GEORGE, I don’t know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. He’ll understand that.,8
1951,JERRY," All fathers are intimidating. They’re intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, “To hell with the world, I can make my own people. I’ll eat whatever I want, I’ll wear whatever I want, and I’ll create whoever I want.”",8
1952,ALTON,  Who’d you call?,8
1953,GEORGE,  My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.,8
1954,ALTON, What kind of operation?,8
1955,GEORGE, Bone marrow.,8
1956,MANAGER, Mister Benes?,8
1957,ALTON, Yes?,8
1958,MANAGER, A message for you.,8
1959,ALTON, From Elaine. She got tied up. She’ll be here in thirty minutes.,8
1960,ALTON," Yeah, they should’ve taken care of Castro when they had the chance. Like we did in Guatamala in ‘fifty-three.",8
1961,JERRY," Well, Guatamala...",8
1962,GEORGE," Sure, Guatamala...",8
1963,ALTON," All right, you boys get yourselves together. We’ll head up to the restaurant. I’ll leave a note for Elaine. I’m going to the bathroom.",8
1964,GEORGE," Come on, let’s go!",8
1965,JERRY, What about Elaine?,8
1966,GEORGE, To hell with Elaine!,8
1967,JERRY, She’ll be furious.,8
1968,GEORGE, We’re dying here!,8
1969,JERRY, That’s her! She’s here!,8
1970,ELAINE, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Where is Dad?,8
1971,GEORGE,  He’s in the bathroom.,8
1972,JERRY,  Where have you been?!,8
1973,ELAINE," Kramer! That... Kramer! I’m just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...",8
1974,JERRY," Oh, you didn’t...",8
1975,ELAINE," Well, he said he’d drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesn’t come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. He’s a city marshal. He’s towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, we’re wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now we’re running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus!  So how’s everything going over here?",8
1976,JERRY, Great.,8
1977,GEORGE, Couldn’t be better.,8
1978,ELAINE, Good. ‘Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.,8
1979,JERRY," Oh, no, no.",8
1980,GEORGE, Get outta here..,8
1981,ELAINE," Man, Kramer! I could kill him!",8
1982,JERRY, I can’t believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.,8
1983,ELAINE , He said he’d give me a lift.,8
1984,JERRY," Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren’s song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?",8
1985,GEORGE, Where do you come up with this stuff?,8
1986,ALTON," Well, look who’s here.",8
1987,ELAINE," Oh, hi, Dad.",8
1988,ALTON," Hello, dear.",8
1989,ALTON, Who’s the lipstick for?,8
1990,ELAINE, No one.,8
1991,ALTON, How’s your mother?,8
1992,ELAINE, Fine.,8
1993,ALTON, How about you? Are you working?,8
1994,ELAINE," Yeah, I’m reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.",8
1995,ALTON," Pendant! Those bastards. Well all right, boys. We’ll go to that Pakistani restaurant on 46th Street. You’re not afraid of a little spice, are you?",8
1996,GEORGE,  “Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...”,8
1997,ALTON," Pipe down, chorus boy.",8
1998,ELAINE, Ohh... it’s snowing. It’s beautiful.,8
1999,JERRY,"  Snow. Snow, that can’t be good for suede, can it?",8
2000,GEORGE, I wouldn’t think so.,8
2001,JERRY," What should I do?  Uh, we’re taking a cab, aren’t we?",8
2002,ALTON, Cab? It’s only five blocks.,8
2003,GEORGE,  Why don’t you just turn it inside out?,8
2004,JERRY, Inside out! Great.,8
2005,ALTON, Wait a minute. What the hell do you call this?,8
2006,JERRY," Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.",8
2007,ALTON," Well, you look like a damn fool!",8
2008,JERRY," Well, it’s a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.",8
2009,ALTON," Well, you’re not going to walk down the street with me and my daughter dressed like that. That’s for damn sure.",8
2010,GEORGE," It’s uh, it's only a few blocks.",8
2011,JERRY,  Elaine?,8
2012,ELAINE, Yeah.,8
2013,JERRY, Come on up.,8
2014,KRAMER, Hey.,8
2015,JERRY, Hey.,8
2016,KRAMER, I’ve gotta feed the birds.,8
2017,JERRY, So?,8
2018,KRAMER, You got any of those mini Ritzes?,8
2019,JERRY, I can’t believe I do.,8
2020,KRAMER," Yeah! Well, are you going out?",8
2021,JERRY, Yeah.,8
2022,KRAMER," Hey, where’s your new jacket?  What?  Ohhh. What did you do to it?",8
2023,JERRY, I was out in the snow last night.,8
2024,KRAMER, Don’t you know what that does to suede?,8
2025,JERRY, I have an idea.  We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.,8
2026,ELAINE," Okay.  Hello.  Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.",8
2027,JERRY, Is he still in town?,8
2028,ELAINE," No, he’s driving back to Maryland tonight.",8
2029,KRAMER," So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?",8
2030,JERRY, I don’t know.,8
2031,KRAMER,  Well...,8
2032,ELAINE,"  I didn’t want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.",8
2033,JERRY, Really?,8
2034,KRAMER, You gonna throw this out?,8
2035,JERRY," Well, I can’t wear it.",8
2036,ELAINE," Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.",8
2037,KRAMER,"  Well, if you’re just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.",8
2038,JERRY," Yeah, go ahead, take it.",8
2039,ELAINE, Dad thinks George is gay.,8
2040,JERRY," Oh, because of all the singing?",8
2041,ELAINE," No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.",8
2042,KRAMER," Hey, see, I like it like this.",8
2043,ELAINE," Isn’t that...?  Oh, is this from the snow last night?  Ugh... you know what you should’ve done? You should’ve turned it inside out.",8
2044,JERRY, I’ll try and remember that.,8
2045,KRAMER," Boy, it’s too bad you gave me this one too.",8
2046,JERRY," Yeah, too bad.",8
2047,KRAMER, I’m gonna have to do something about this lining.,8
2048,ALTON,  “Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm...”,8
2049,JERRY," I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I don’t get this. Aren’t cows outside most of the time? I don’t understand it. When it’s raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, “Let us in, we’re all wearin’ leather. Open the door! We’re gonna ruin the whole outfit here!” “Is it suede?” “I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I can’t have this cleaned. It’s all I got!” ",8
2050,JERRY," The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what you’re doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? “We have soda, we have soda, we have soda”, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. It’s a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and you’re watching TV and you’re drinking the exact same product that they’re advertising right there on TV, and it’s like, you know, they’re spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and I’m standing there, “Maybe I’m putting too much ice in mine.”",9
2051,GEORGE,"  So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn’t sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I don’t know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like they’re psychotic or something and I don’t know if I’m supposed to smile back, I don’t know what to do. So I just stood there like – remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? That’s what I looked like.",9
2052,JERRY, So you didn’t ask?,9
2053,GEORGE," No, I froze.",9
2054,JERRY, Counter.,9
2055,GEORGE," Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I’m back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, “So why don’t you call her?” I says, “I can’t.” I couldn’t, I couldn’t do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.",9
2056,JERRY, He said wuss?,9
2057,GEORGE," Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.",9
2058,JERRY, So you called.,9
2059,GEORGE," Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.",9
2060,JERRY, Yeah. Like a farm boy.,9
2061,GEORGE," Right. So I call her up, I tell her it’s me, she gives me an enthusiastic ‘Hi!’",9
2062,JERRY, Wow. The enthusiastic hi. That’s beautiful.,9
2063,GEORGE," Oh, I don’t get the enthusiastic hi, I’m outta there.",9
2064,JERRY," All right, so you’re chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.",9
2065,GEORGE," So, we’re talking, and I don’t like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, “What are you doing Saturday night?”",9
2066,JERRY, And?,9
2067,GEORGE, She bought.,9
2068,JERRY, Great day in the morning.,9
2069,GEORGE, Then I got off the phone right away.,9
2070,JERRY," Sure, it’s like robbing a bank. You don’t loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.",9
2071,GEORGE," It’s amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I can’t remember the last time that happened.",9
2072,GEORGE, I can’t stand doing laundry. That’s why I have forty pairs of underwear.,9
2073,CAROL, You do not.,9
2074,GEORGE," Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.",9
2075,JERRY,"  Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.",9
2076,DONNA, That’s Irish.,9
2077,JERRY," Irish, Scottish, what’s the difference, lassie?",9
2078,CAROL," So, uh, thanks for dinner. It was great.",9
2079,GEORGE, Yeah.  We should do this again.,9
2080,CAROL, Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?,9
2081,GEORGE," Oh, no, thanks. I can’t drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.",9
2082,CAROL,"  So, um, okay.",9
2083,GEORGE, Okay.,9
2084,CAROL, Goodnight.,9
2085,GEORGE," Yeah, take it easy.",9
2086,DONNA, Thanks again for the movie.,9
2087,JERRY, You’re welcome.,9
2088,DONNA," I’d invite you up, but the place is being painted.",9
2089,JERRY," Oh, that’s okay.",9
2090,DONNA, Unless you want to go to your place.,9
2091,JERRY," Okay... but there’s no cake or anything, if that’s what you’re looking for.",9
2092,GEORGE,  Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!,9
2093,JERRY," I think if one’s going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. It’s common courtesy. I don’t know. That’s just the way I was brought up.",9
2094,DONNA, Values are very important.,9
2095,JERRY," Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?",9
2096,DONNA, Thursday’s great.,9
2097,JERRY," Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I don’t feel comfortable in them.",9
2098,DONNA, Are those Cotton Dockers?,9
2099,JERRY," Oh, I can’t begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.",9
2100,DONNA, Really? I like that commercial.,9
2101,JERRY, You like that commercial?,9
2102,DONNA," Yeah, it’s clever.",9
2103,JERRY," Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?",9
2104,DONNA," Yeah, that’s the one.",9
2105,JERRY, What could you possibly like about that?,9
2106,DONNA," I don’t know. I like the, guys.",9
2107,JERRY," Yeah, they’re so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.",9
2108,DONNA ," Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.",9
2109,JERRY," Even if the dialogue did ring true.  Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesn’t that bother you?",9
2110,DONNA,"  That’s the idea. That’s what’s clever about it, that they’re not talking about the pants.",9
2111,JERRY, But they’re talking about nothing.,9
2112,DONNA, That’s the point.,9
2113,JERRY, I know the point.,9
2114,DONNA, No one is telling you to like it.,9
2115,JERRY," I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?",9
2116,JERRY," What’s brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy’ll be like, “I don’t think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life?” And of course the woman’s looking at the guy, thinking, “What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?”",9
2117,JERRY," I’m supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?",9
2118,ELAINE, I once broke up with a guy because he didn’t keep his bathroom clean enough.,9
2119,JERRY, No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?,9
2120,ELAINE," Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there – they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.",9
2121,ELAINE, Hi.,9
2122,JERRY, You’re still thinking about this?,9
2123,GEORGE," She invites me up at twelve o’clock at night, for coffee, and I don’t go up. “No thank you. I don’t want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee.” I said this to her. People this stupid shouldn’t be allowed to live. I can’t imagine what she must think of me.",9
2124,JERRY, She thinks you’re a guy that doesn’t like coffee.,9
2125,GEORGE," She invited me up. Coffee’s not coffee, coffee is sex.",9
2126,ELAINE, Maybe coffee was coffee.,9
2127,GEORGE, Coffee’s coffee in the morning. It’s not coffee at twelve o’clock at night.,9
2128,ELAINE, Well some people drink coffee that late.,9
2129,GEORGE," Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who’re on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, “Keep it up, don’t blow it, you’re doing great.”",9
2130,ELAINE, It’s all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.,9
2131,GEORGE, I can’t call her now. It’s too soon. I’m planning a Wednesday call.,9
2132,ELAINE," Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.",9
2133,GEORGE," Of course you do, but you’re imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, “Oh no, I don’t drink coffee late at night.” If I call her now, she’s gonna think I’m too needy. Women don’t wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy – a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.",9
2134,ELAINE, All she’ll think is that you like her.,9
2135,GEORGE, That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid!,9
2136,ELAINE," Well, she wants you to like her.",9
2137,GEORGE," Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesn’t like me!",9
2138,ELAINE, I don’t know what your parents did to you.,9
2139,KRAMER," Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, you’re up there, you’re on the stage and you go, “Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someone’s in a life-and-death situation, and we’re thinking, “Well, sorry buddy, you should’ve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.”",9
2140,KRAMER, So you gonna use it?,9
2141,JERRY , I don’t think so.,9
2142,KRAMER, It’s funny.,9
2143,ELAINE, It is funny.,9
2144,JERRY, I like to use my own material.,9
2145,KRAMER, That’s as good as anything you do.,9
2146,GEORGE," All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.",9
2147,JERRY, Why do we have to leave?,9
2148,GEORGE," Because I can’t call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, let’s go.",9
2149,ELAINE," Oh, see, this is the problem.",9
2150,JERRY, You’re kicking me out of my house?,9
2151,GEORGE, Yes.,9
2152,ELAINE,  Don’t forget.,9
2153,GEORGE,"  Right, alright.  Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?",9
2154,JERRY, Don’t do the apples. It’s enough already with the apples.,9
2155,CAROL,"  Hi, it’s Carol, I’ll get back to you.",9
2156,GEORGE," Um, hi, it’s George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didn’t come up for coffee. You see, I didn’t realise that coffee didn’t really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. It’s up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The ball’s in your court. So uh, take it easy.",9
2157,JERRY," I’m just gonna get my jacket, I’ll meet you downstairs. What’s the matter, did you call?",9
2158,GEORGE," Got her machine. I’m dead, I’m a dead man. That’s it. I’m dead, I’m a dead man. Dead man.",9
2159,JERRY, What did you say?,9
2160,GEORGE," I don’t know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and there’s nothing I can do. It’s a machine. The little light is blinking right now, “Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot’s on!”",9
2161,JERRY, After one date you try and improvise on her machine?,9
2162,GEORGE, Now I’m in the worst position of all.,9
2163,ELAINE," Y’know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy’s machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasn’t supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guy’s house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.",9
2164,GEORGE, He did that?,9
2165,ELAINE, Yeah.,9
2166,GEORGE, Somebody did that?,9
2167,JERRY, She’ll call you back. You’re overreacting.,9
2168,JERRY, Not once.,9
2169,DONNA, Never?,9
2170,JERRY," I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.",9
2171,DONNA, That’s amazing.,9
2172,JERRY, Thank you.,9
2173,DONNA, Is there anything else about you I should know?,9
2174,JERRY," Yes, I’m lactose intolerant.",9
2175,DONNA, Really?,9
2176,JERRY," I have no patience for lactose. And I won’t stand for it. Um, I’ll be right back.",9
2177,GEORGE," Wait till you hear this!  Whoa, ah, I’m sorry, I didn’t, I had no idea.",9
2178,DONNA," Wait, wait. He’s in the bathroom.",9
2179,GEORGE," I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I’ll come back.",9
2180,DONNA, You don’t have to leave.,9
2181,GEORGE, You sure?,9
2182,DONNA, Yes.,9
2183,GEORGE, Okay.,9
2184,DONNA, I’m Donna.,9
2185,GEORGE," Donna. Oh, you’re the one that likes that commercial!",9
2186,DONNA, He told you about that?,9
2187,GEORGE,"  No, he, he didn’t actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial – in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. He’s, he’s like a clam. You’re not gonna mention this, to him...",9
2188,DONNA,  So you go around telling your friends I’m not hip because I like that commercial.,9
2189,JERRY," What?  What did, what did you say?",9
2190,GEORGE," Say? What? Nothing, I...",9
2191,DONNA, You told him how I like the commercial.,9
2192,JERRY," Well, so what if I said that?",9
2193,DONNA," Well, so, you didn’t have to tell your friends.",9
2194,JERRY," No, I had to tell my friends – my friends didn’t have to tell you.",9
2195,GEORGE,  Why did you have to get me in trouble?,9
2196,DONNA, I don’t like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.,9
2197,GEORGE, Boy oh boy.,9
2198,JERRY, I said I couldn’t believe you liked that commercial. So what?,9
2199,DONNA," I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial.",9
2200,JERRY," Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.",9
2201,KRAMER, Hey.,9
2202,JERRY," Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.",9
2203,KRAMER, Oh. Cotton Dockers!,9
2204,GEORGE," Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...",9
2205,KRAMER, What? Where are we going?,9
2206,GEORGE, Come on!,9
2207,DONNA," Don’t bother, I’m leaving.",9
2208,JERRY," Donna, really, you’re making too much of this.",9
2209,KRAMER," “One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If they’re not Dockers, they’re just pants”",9
2210,JERRY," Please, Donna...",9
2211,DONNA, I don’t wanna hear it.,9
2212,GEORGE," I can’t believe I said that. You know me, I’m a vault.",9
2213,JERRY," Don’t worry about it, it wasn’t working anyway.",9
2214,KRAMER, What happened there?,9
2215,JERRY, I’ll tell you later.,9
2216,GEORGE, You are not gonna believe what’s going on with this woman.,9
2217,GEORGE," Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesn’t call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, “I know you’re there, I don’t know what your story is.” Yesterday, I’m a volcano – I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, “Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you don’t call me back for four days? I don’t like coffee, I don’t have to come up. I’d like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.”",9
2218,JERRY, You said that?,9
2219,GEORGE, I lost it.,9
2220,JERRY, I can’t blame you. I can’t believe she never called you back.,9
2221,GEORGE, She did. Today.,9
2222,JERRY, What?,9
2223,GEORGE," She called my office. She said she’s been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didn’t know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and she’s been using her old machine and she doesn’t have the beeper for it.",9
2224,JERRY, So she didn’t get the messages.,9
2225,GEORGE," Exactly, but they’re on there – waiting. She said she can’t wait to see me, we’re having dinner tonight. She’s supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.",9
2226,JERRY, But what about the messages?,9
2227,JERRY, Elaine’s thing? How you gonna get in?,9
2228,GEORGE, I’ll meet her outside the building.,9
2229,JERRY, But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she’s going right for that machine.,9
2230,GEORGE," Unless she goes for the bathroom. That’s my only chance.  Who am I kidding? I can’t do this, I can’t do this. I don’t even know how to work those stupid machines.",9
2231,JERRY," There’s nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.",9
2232,GEORGE, You do it for me.,9
2233,JERRY, What?,9
2234,GEORGE," Come on, it’ll be so much easier.",9
2235,JERRY, How you gonna get me up there?,9
2236,GEORGE," I’ll tell her I bumped into you, I’m giving you a ride uptown.",9
2237,JERRY, And who makes the switch?,9
2238,GEORGE, You do.,9
2239,JERRY, I do.,9
2240,GEORGE ," I can’t do it. I’ll, I’ll keep her busy.",9
2241,JERRY, I can’t get involved in this.,9
2242,GEORGE, I think I may be in love with this woman.,9
2243,JERRY, What if she sees me?,9
2244,GEORGE," Oh, you are such a wuss.",9
2245,JERRY, A wuss?,9
2246,GEORGE, Yeah.,9
2247,JERRY, Did you call me a wuss?,9
2248,GEORGE, Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.,9
2249,JERRY," I got one problem. You’re keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that she’s coming.",9
2250,GEORGE," A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, I’ll call out tippy-toe!",9
2251,JERRY, Tippy Toe? I don’t think so.,9
2252,GEORGE, You don’t like tippy toe?,9
2253,JERRY, No tippy toe.,9
2254,GEORGE," All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, I’ll sing.",9
2255,JERRY, What song?,9
2256,GEORGE, “How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?”,9
2257,JERRY, What is that?,9
2258,GEORGE," Oh, it’s a lovely song.  “How do you solve a problem like Maria?...”",9
2259,JERRY, Anything else?,9
2260,GEORGE, You pick it.,9
2261,JERRY, “Lemon Tree.”,9
2262,GEORGE," Peter, Paul and Mary.",9
2263,JERRY," No, Trini Lopez.",9
2264,GEORGE, Alright ok. You got the tape?,9
2265,JERRY, Standard. Micro.,9
2266,GEORGE, How do you feel? Confident?,9
2267,JERRY, Feel good.,9
2268,GEORGE, You nervous?,9
2269,JERRY, Not at all.,9
2270,GEORGE," Get up, get up, it’s her! Oh, the hell with this, I’m scared to death, just walk away, it’s off, cancel everything, go!",9
2271,CAROL, Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home.,9
2272,GEORGE," I, I couldn’t wait. I was too anxious to see you.",9
2273,CAROL," Oh, that’s so sweet.",9
2274,GEORGE," Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isn’t that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.",9
2275,JERRY, All the time.,9
2276,CAROL, It’s nice to meet you.,9
2277,JERRY, Hi.,9
2278,CAROL," So, I’m starving. Where are we gonna eat?",9
2279,GEORGE," You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.",9
2280,CAROL," Okay. Let’s go, I’m ready, where’d you park?",9
2281,GEORGE, Don’t you wanna go upstairs first?,9
2282,CAROL," No, what for? I’ll just give my bag to the doorman.",9
2283,JERRY," You know, I really need to use the bathroom.",9
2284,CAROL, Oh well there’s a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.,9
2285,GEORGE," Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...",9
2286,CAROL, Well they have a phone.,9
2287,GEORGE, I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.,9
2288,CAROL,"  You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine.",9
2289,GEORGE," Right, right.",9
2290,CAROL, The bathroom’s on the hall to the right.,9
2291,JERRY," Uh, you know, why don’t you go first, you just had a long trip.",9
2292,CAROL," No, I’m fine.",9
2293,JERRY," Um, you know, it’s the damnedest thing. It went away.",9
2294,CAROL," Oh, that’s weird.",9
2295,GEORGE," No, no that can happen. I’ve, uh, I’ve read about that in medical journals. It’s a freak thing, but...",9
2296,CAROL," Well, let me just check my messages, and we’ll go.",9
2297,GEORGE," Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?",9
2298,CAROL, Sure.,9
2299,GEORGE," Please, this is very, very important.",9
2300,GEORGE,"  Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!",9
2301,CAROL,"  Now I know who you are! You’re a comedian. I’ve seen you, it’s driving me crazy.",9
2302,JERRY, Right. I am.,9
2303,GEORGE," Carol, that’s so rude. Please, I’m serious, just for a moment, if you wouldn’t mind. And then we’ll talk to Jerry.",9
2304,JERRY,  Hey you two. I’m ready to go.,9
2305,CAROL, That’s what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?,9
2306,GEORGE,  Don’t you find that strange?,9
2307,JERRY, Yes.,9
2308,CAROL," Well, I’ll just check my machine and we’ll go.",9
2309,CAROL," No, nothing here, let’s go.  Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone.",9
2310,GEORGE," Oh, uh...",9
2311,CAROL," Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.",9
2312,JERRY," I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didn’t want to talk to, I could go, “Excuse me, I’m not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away.” I also have a cordless phone, but I don’t like that as much, because you can’t slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone – “You can’t talk to me like that!” Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone – “You can’t talk to me like that!”													 “I told him!”",9
2313,JERRY," Well, I painted my apartment again. I’ve been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, it’s a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize it’s just the thickness of the paint, but I’m aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, it’s closer and closer. I don’t even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. That’s where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... That’s why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. That’s why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.",10
2314,JERRY, What did you do?,10
2315,KRAMER, Mousse. I moussed up.,10
2316,ELAINE, I guess it was just a matter of time.,10
2317,KRAMER," You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?",10
2318,JERRY," Well, looks are so subjective.",10
2319,ELAINE," I don’t mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.",10
2320,KRAMER,"  Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!",10
2321,ELAINE," She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.",10
2322,JERRY, Maybe.,10
2323,HAROLD,"  No, I’m not going up there.",10
2324,JERRY,  Harold and Manny.,10
2325,HAROLD, I’m not going.,10
2326,JERRY," Boys, boys.",10
2327,HAROLD," Oh, Jerry.",10
2328,JERRY," I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?",10
2329,HAROLD," Yeah, yeah... Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalker’s apartment?",10
2330,MANNY,  You can't give him anything from there!,10
2331,HAROLD, I was only joking.  He thinks I’m gonna give you Mrs. Hudwalker’s things.,10
2332,MANNY,  You offered them to him.,10
2333,HAROLD,  We have to go up there now and clean the apartment. It’s a good thing her rent was overdue. She’d be rotting up there for a month.,10
2334,JERRY, She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died?,10
2335,HAROLD, Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didn’t have her wig on. It was horrifying.,10
2336,MANNY,"  Harold, Come on, hurry up!",10
2337,HAROLD,"  What’s the matter with you? I’m talking! So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?",10
2338,JERRY, Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?,10
2339,HAROLD," Oh yeah, I like her. She always says hello to me.",10
2340,JERRY, It’s not promised to anybody? ‘Cause she’d take it in a second.,10
2341,HAROLD," Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported.",10
2342,MANNY,  What do you mean deported? It was a misunderstanding with the Department of Immigration.,10
2343,HAROLD, What’s the difference? It’s true!,10
2344,JERRY," So, it’s okay? I could just tell her she can have it?",10
2345,HAROLD," Sure, sure. She’s getting a bargain, too. It’s only four hundred dollars a month.",10
2346,MANNY,  Four hundred dollars? What are you nuts? Someone will pay more.,10
2347,HAROLD, Okay...,10
2348,HAROLD, Okay!,10
2349,KRAMER," Hey, Harold, what do you think?",10
2350,HAROLD," Manny, look. Kramer put mousse in his hair.",10
2351,MANNY,  It looks worse.,10
2352,KRAMER,"  Hey, thanks.",10
2353,ELAINE, What was that all about?,10
2354,JERRY,"  Oh, nothing important.",10
2355,ELAINE, What’s going on? What is that look?,10
2356,JERRY, What look? Nothing.,10
2357,ELAINE, Something’s going on here.,10
2358,JERRY," I don’t know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I can’t decide.",10
2359,ELAINE, Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? C’mon. Cough it up.,10
2360,JERRY," Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am – rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...",10
2361,ELAINE, Would you please?,10
2362,JERRY, What would you say if I told you that...,10
2363,ELAINE, Told me what?!,10
2364,JERRY, ...I got you an apartment in this building.,10
2365,ELAINE,  No.,10
2366,JERRY, Yes.,10
2367,ELAINE, No.,10
2368,JERRY, Yes.,10
2369,ELAINE, You didn’t.,10
2370,JERRY, I did.,10
2371,ELAINE, You got me an apartment in the building?!,10
2372,JERRY, I got you an apartment in the building.,10
2373,ELAINE, How did you...,10
2374,JERRY, Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?,10
2375,ELAINE, No.,10
2376,JERRY, She died.,10
2377,ELAINE,  She died?!,10
2378,JERRY, She died.,10
2379,ELAINE, She died!,10
2380,JERRY, And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!,10
2381,ELAINE, Get out!,10
2382,ELAINE, Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!,10
2383,JERRY, Four hundred a month.,10
2384,ELAINE, And I’ll be right upstairs?,10
2385,JERRY, Right upstairs.,10
2386,ELAINE, Right above you?,10
2387,JERRY, Right above me.,10
2388,ELAINE," Oh, we’re neighbors. I’ll be here all the time!",10
2389,JERRY, All the time.,10
2390,ELAINE,"  We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!",10
2391,JERRY, All the time.,10
2392,JERRY," The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like you’re always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. You’re out somewhere with people, “Gee, you look pregnant.. are you?” “Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, that’s not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Let’s take this whole scene again. People, think about what you’re saying!”",10
2393,GEORGE," Thanks, see you later, Donna.",10
2394,GEORGE, What happened to you?,10
2395,JERRY, You can’t believe what I just did.,10
2396,GEORGE, What? What did you do?,10
2397,JERRY," I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn’t believe it. It’s not believable.",10
2398,GEORGE, What did you do?,10
2399,JERRY, How could I have done that?,10
2400,GEORGE, Done what?,10
2401,JERRY, I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. She’s going to move in.,10
2402,GEORGE, Elaine’s moving into your building?,10
2403,JERRY, Yes. Right above me.,10
2404,GEORGE, Right above you?,10
2405,JERRY, Yeah.,10
2406,GEORGE, You’re gonna be neighbors.,10
2407,JERRY, I know. Neighbors.,10
2408,GEORGE, She’s right above you?,10
2409,JERRY, Right above me.,10
2410,GEORGE, How could you do that?,10
2411,JERRY," ‘Cause I’m an idiot! You may think you’re an idiot, but with all due respect, I’m a much bigger idiot than you are.",10
2412,GEORGE," Don’t insult me, my friend. Remember who you’re talking to. No one’s a bigger idiot than me.",10
2413,JERRY, Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?,10
2414,GEORGE, Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Pocono’s?,10
2415,JERRY," She’s right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, I’m gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.",10
2416,GEORGE, You’re doomed. You’re gonna have to have all your sex at women’s apartments. It’ll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.,10
2417,JERRY, But I need the home bed advantage.,10
2418,GEORGE, Of course. We all do.,10
2419,JERRY, Come in for two minutes and sit with me.,10
2420,GEORGE, I was just in there. It’s embarrassing.,10
2421,JERRY," Oh, who’s gonna know?",10
2422,GEORGE, They saw me walk out.,10
2423,JERRY, Two minutes.,10
2424,JERRY, My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don’t make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.,10
2425,GEORGE, My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.,10
2426,JERRY," So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?",10
2427,GEORGE, Tough.,10
2428,JERRY," You know, the water pressure’s terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.",10
2429,GEORGE, I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.,10
2430,JERRY," If they were fanatic about showers, they might.",10
2431,GEORGE," For that rent, she’d take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.",10
2432,JERRY," Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn’t that child abuse?",10
2433,GEORGE," I’d like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?",10
2434,JERRY," Yeah, the guy with the flat head.",10
2435,GEORGE," He’s a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since he’s been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.",10
2436,JERRY," Yeah, I’ve heard that about wedding bands.",10
2437,GEORGE, I wonder if that’s really true.,10
2438,JERRY," That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his father’s band. He’d loan it to you.",10
2439,GEORGE, Thanks a lot. I’ll give it back to you in a week.,10
2440,KRAMER," You know, I don’t even know why you’re fooling around with this ring. I’ve been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.",10
2441,GEORGE, I’m not doing that.,10
2442,KRAMER," Oh, man. You know, you’re crazy. You’re a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?",10
2443,GEORGE," No, I’ll put half a can of mousse in my head like you.",10
2444,HAROLD," I told you I don’t like these sponges, they’re too small! I want a big sponge!",10
2445,HAROLD, You can’t pick up anything with these! There’s no absorption!,10
2446,JERRY," Boys, boys.",10
2447,HAROLD," Hi, Jerry.",10
2448,MANNY," Hello, Jerry.  You tell him.",10
2449,HAROLD, Okay,10
2450,MANNY,  You tell him.,10
2451,HAROLD," Your friend can’t have the apartment, Jerry.",10
2452,JERRY, What?,10
2453,HAROLD, Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I don’t want to do it. Manny wants to do it.,10
2454,MANNY,  Why are you telling him it's my fault?,10
2455,HAROLD, Because it’s true! Why shouldn’t I tell him?,10
2456,JERRY," Hey, hey. I understand. You’re businessmen.",10
2457,MANNY,  Tell him that if his friend can come up with the same money then she can have the apartment.,10
2458,HAROLD," Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, we’ll give it to her.",10
2459,JERRY," Well, that’s a lot of money. But, if that’s the way it’s gotta be, that’s the way it’s gotta be.",10
2460,JERRY," You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.",10
2461,GEORGE, What happened to you?,10
2462,JERRY," Religion, my friend, that’s what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that it’s going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.",10
2463,GEORGE,  Five thousand dollars? She doesn’t have five thousand dollars!,10
2464,JERRY, Of course she doesn’t have five thousand dollars!,10
2465,GEORGE," So, she can’t get the apartment.",10
2466,JERRY, Can’t get it.,10
2467,GEORGE," So, she doesn’t move in.",10
2468,JERRY," No move. So, you see, it’s all part of a divine plan.",10
2469,GEORGE, And how does the baldness fit into that plan?,10
2470,JERRY,  Elaine?,10
2471,ELAINE, Yeah.,10
2472,JERRY,"  All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend I’m disappointed. You’re going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.",10
2473,GEORGE, Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!,10
2474,JERRY," ‘Cause you know, I love Elaine.",10
2475,GEORGE, Of course you do.,10
2476,JERRY," But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.",10
2477,ELAINE,"  No, I’ll be seeing you.  ""Good morning, good morning..”  Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt it’s great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?",10
2478,ELAINE," Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last month’s security deposit.  I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.",10
2479,JERRY, Well... there’s a little bit of a problem.,10
2480,ELAINE," Oh, I know. There’s a weak shower spray, I know. I’ve already thought about it, and I’m switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, “Why stand when you can sit?” Maybe I’ll get some rubber duckies.",10
2481,JERRY," Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. I’m sure they’d just as soon give it to you, but you’d have to come up with that money.",10
2482,ELAINE, Five thousand dollars? I don’t have five thousand dollars.,10
2483,JERRY, I know.,10
2484,ELAINE,  How am I going to get five thousand dollars?,10
2485,JERRY, I have no idea.,10
2486,KRAMER,"  Hey, my new neighbor!",10
2487,ELAINE, I’m not moving in.,10
2488,KRAMER, What?,10
2489,ELAINE, They want five thousand dollars now.,10
2490,KRAMER," So, okay uh what’s the problem?",10
2491,ELAINE, I don’t have five thousand dollars.,10
2492,KRAMER," C’mon, you can come up with five thousand dollars.  Jerry, you don’t have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.",10
2493,JERRY," Yeah, well, I didn’t- Is that something you want to borrow?",10
2494,ELAINE," No, that’s too much money to borrow.",10
2495,KRAMER, Loan her the money. You can afford it.,10
2496,JERRY, She doesn’t wanna borrow the money.,10
2497,KRAMER," Oh, c’mon. She’ll pay you back. What’s five grand between friends?",10
2498,ELAINE, Of course I’d pay you back..,10
2499,KRAMER," Yeah, so what’s the problem?",10
2500,JERRY, Who said there’s a problem?,10
2501,KRAMER, Hey see He said he’d loan you the money.,10
2502,ELAINE," Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?",10
2503,KRAMER, That’s okay. He doesn’t care.,10
2504,ELAINE," Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.",10
2505,KRAMER, Get outta here.,10
2506,ELAINE, Let me think about it.,10
2507,KRAMER, What’s to think about?,10
2508,ELAINE, I don’t know... I don’t know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.,10
2509,JERRY,"  It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Where’s she gonna get five thousand? She doesn’t have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. She’s gone. Then you come in, “Why don’t you loan her five thousand? What do you care? You’ve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!”",10
2510,KRAMER, You didn’t want her in the building?,10
2511,JERRY," No, I didn’t!",10
2512,KRAMER," Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she won’t take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.",10
2513,JERRY, People don’t turn down money. It’s what separates us from the animals.,10
2514,KRAMER, I still don’t understand what the problem is having her in the building.,10
2515,JERRY," Let me explain something to you. You see, you’re not normal. You’re a great guy, I love you, but you’re a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldn’t understand.",10
2516,KRAMER, Because I’m a pod?,10
2517,ELAINE, I’ll take it!,10
2518,ROXANNE," Hi, Elaine.",10
2519,ELAINE," Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry.",10
2520,JERRY, Hi,10
2521,ELAINE, Jerry’s the one who got me my new apartment.,10
2522,ROXANNE," So, you’re Elaine’s hero.",10
2523,JERRY," Yes, it’s my life’s work.",10
2524,ROXANNE, There are so few true heroes left in this world.,10
2525,GEORGE," Yeah, my wife couldn’t make it today. She’s got something with her mother... Who knows what’s going on with her. Don’t let any one kid you, it’s tough.",10
2526,JERRY," Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.",10
2527,ROXANNE," Oh, the marathon is great, isn’t it?",10
2528,JERRY," Oh, yes. Particularly if you’re not in it.",10
2529,ROXANNE, I wish we had a view of the finish line.,10
2530,JERRY," What’s to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.",10
2531,GEORGE," ...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. I’m tellin’ you, it’s one thing after another.",10
2532,RITA, Is she here?,10
2533,GEORGE," Uh no no, she’s working.",10
2534,RITA, What does she do?,10
2535,GEORGE," She’s an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?",10
2536,RITA," I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. It’s great! I can get free tickets to any sporting in New York. Anyway, she’s a very luck woman. Enjoy the race.",10
2537,GEORGE,  But..,10
2538,ROXANNE, Hi Stan. Joanne.,10
2539,ELAINE," Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. They’re in my short story class with Roxanne and me.",10
2540,JERRY, Hi how are ya?,10
2541,ELAINE," Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!",10
2542,JOANNE," Well, Jerry, it’ll be nice having a close friend nearby.",10
2543,JERRY,  Fantastic.,10
2544,STAN, She can pop in whenever she wants.,10
2545,JERRY, I know.,10
2546,JOANNE, She doesn’t even need to knock!,10
2547,JERRY, It’s tremendous.,10
2548,STAN, Anytime of day.,10
2549,JERRY, I’m in heaven.,10
2550,ELAINE," Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. He’s the one who got me the apartment.",10
2551,RITA," Oh, hi.  Bob, this is the guy who got Elaine the apartment.",10
2552,GEORGE," I’m sorry, I don’t see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, what’s so hard?",10
2553,SUSIE," So uh, are you really married? Because, I’ve actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attract women.",10
2554,GEORGE,  You’d have to be a real loser to try something like that.,10
2555,SUSIE," That’s too bad, because I really have a thing for bald guys with glasses.",10
2556,RITA, Hey everybody! Here come the runners!,10
2557,ELAINE,"  So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?",10
2558,JERRY," Oh, I wouldn’t quite say that.",10
2559,ELAINE," Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.",10
2560,JERRY, I’m a guy – it always looks like that.,10
2561,ELAINE," Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, y’know... cramp our styles?",10
2562,JERRY, Nah...,10
2563,ELAINE," Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as you’re okay with it, it’s fine with me.",10
2564,JANICE," I’ve never been able to be with just one person. I can, however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years. It’s a shame you’re married.",10
2565,GEORGE," Umm, I’m not. It’s just a sociological experiment!",10
2566,JANICE, Please...,10
2567,JERRY, You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didn’t take it.  This is an idiot.,10
2568,GEORGE," Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza",10
2569,ROXANNE,  You’re all winners!,10
2570,GEORGE," But suddenly, a new contender has emerged...",10
2571,JERRY," George, I didn’t sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. I’m just going to be honest. That’s all... Yes, I’m nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. It’ll slide right off... Then try axle grease...  I’ll call you back after I talk to her... Bye.",10
2572,KRAMER," Well, it’s all taken care of. Everything’s cool.",10
2573,JERRY, What? What’s cool?,10
2574,KRAMER, Elaine.,10
2575,JERRY, What are you talking about?,10
2576,KRAMER, I just found a guy who’s willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.,10
2577,JERRY, You what?! Get out!  Ten thousand?,10
2578,KRAMER, Cash.,10
2579,JERRY, Who would pay that much?,10
2580,KRAMER, He’s in the music business.,10
2581,JERRY," Elaine would never borrow that much money!  Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think I’m in the clear here. Elaine’s not moving in. I don’t have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. I’m golden!",10
2582,KRAMER," Well, occasionally I like to help the humans.",10
2583,ELAINE, Wow. You’re right. That is loud.,10
2584,JERRY, It’s just unbelievable.,10
2585,ELAINE, They rehearse all the time?,10
2586,JERRY, All the time. I’ve been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I can’t live like this. I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I’m heading for breakdown!  Can’t you do something?,10
2587,HAROLD, I’m not going up. It stinks up there.,10
2588,JERRY, Manny...,10
2589,MANNY,  They’re allowed to play until eleven o’clock!,10
2590,HAROLD, I’m not the one who said eleven o’clock. He makes up his own rules.,10
2591,ELAINE," Boy, too bad. If I was up there, you’d never hear a peep out of me. I’m as quiet as a mouse.",10
2592,KRAMER," Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! ",10
2593,JERRY," I don’t know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three o’clock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someone’s door and tell them to keep it down? You’re really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? What’s happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. There’s a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. “Shh... shh... shhh... shhh...” Doesn’t work, ‘cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. “Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me.” Some people you can’t shush in a movie theater. There’s always that certain group of people, isn’t it? They’re talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They won’t shush. They’re the unshushables.",10
2594,JERRY,"  Oh, Hi. A hundred episodes,  that's a lot. During the course of which George, Elaine, Kramer and I have had many experiences both positive and negative. Well mostly negative, there have been some relationships that haven't worked out ambitions that were unfulfilled, hopes dashed, some property damage, hurt feels, I know one guy got deported, physical injury an... alright maybe even a death or two.  But we've persevered because we're people... real TV people, and for thirty minutes a week  that's pretty important to us so if you're joining us late  here's some highlights from what's happened so far. ",100
2595,JERRY," Oh, Hi. I didn't realize you'd be back soo soon. You know after a hundred episodes this apartment has really seen a lot of action. George, Kramer,  that girl...  Elaine. But in the end it's really a show about people,  people who really care about each other and I think that says something, I guess, I dunno. Just watch ",100
2596,JERRY, Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.,102
2597,ELAINE, I know. I need a lesson.,102
2598,JERRY, You stink. You know you stink. What is this?,102
2599,ELAINE, Oh. My ballet tickets.,102
2600,JERRY, Oh. Your ballet tickets.,102
2601,ELAINE," Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?",102
2602,JERRY," No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.",102
2603,ELAINE," You know, I'm going as a beard.",102
2604,JERRY, A beard?,102
2605,ELAINE," Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.",102
2606,JERRY, Yes.,102
2607,ELAINE," So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.",102
2608,JERRY, Why are you doing this?,102
2609,ELAINE," Swan Lake, at the Met.",102
2610,KRAMER," Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.",102
2611,ELAINE," Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?",102
2612,JERRY, Yeah.,102
2613,ELAINE, Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?,102
2614,KRAMER, I think he looks fantastic.,102
2615,ELAINE," Oh, come on.",102
2616,KRAMER," No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.",102
2617,GEORGE," Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.",102
2618,ELAINE, You look ridiculous in that thing.,102
2619,GEORGE, Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?,102
2620,ELAINE, Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.,102
2621,GEORGE," Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.",102
2622,KRAMER," You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.",102
2623,JERRY, Well what about me?,102
2624,KRAMER, No I think he's got you beat buddy.,102
2625,GEORGE, So she's gorgeous.,102
2626,KRAMER," Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.",102
2627,GEORGE, Well have you got a picture?,102
2628,KRAMER, No.,102
2629,GEORGE," Well, I have to see her.",102
2630,KRAMER," Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.",102
2631,GEORGE, Really?,102
2632,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.",102
2633,GEORGE, Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?,102
2634,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. I think he will.",102
2635,JERRY, It sounds like an excellent idea.,102
2636,KRAMER," Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.",102
2637,GEORGE, Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.,102
2638,KRAMER, Here you go brother. Some food for you.,102
2639,HOMELESS MAN, Thank you. You're a good man. Bless you.,102
2640,KRAMER, Now are you going to be here in an hour?,102
2641,HOMELESS MAN, Where am I going?,102
2642,KRAMER," Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?",102
2643,LOU, Almond?,102
2644,KRAMER, Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier.,102
2645,GEORGE, Pouty? I like that.,102
2646,JERRY, You can't go wrong with pouty.,102
2647,GEORGE, I'm excited about the pouty.,102
2648,LOU, All right I think that about does it.,102
2649,KRAMER," All right George, come on, take a look.",102
2650,GEORGE," Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.",102
2651,JERRY," Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?",102
2652,LOU," Oh, that's Sergeant Tierney. Nice officer. You want to meet her?",102
2653,GEORGE, Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?,102
2654,JERRY," Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.",102
2655,KRAMER," Hey, man. Enjoy the food?",102
2656,HOMELESS MAN, Yes I did. Where did the Chinese learn to cook like that?,102
2657,KRAMER," Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now.",102
2658,HOMELESS MAN, I don't think so.,102
2659,KRAMER," Woah, woah, that's mine.",102
2660,HOMELESS MAN, You gave it to me.,102
2661,KRAMER," No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.",102
2662,HOMELESS MAN, You should have said something.,102
2663,KRAMER, I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.,102
2664,ROBERT, I've really got to thank you for this.,102
2665,ELAINE," Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.",102
2666,ROBERT, Really. Would you excuse me? I have to run to the bathroom.,102
2667,ELAINE, Yes indeed.,102
2668,BOSS, I'm surprised.,102
2669,ELAINE, Really. Why?,102
2670,BOSS, No reason.,102
2671,ELAINE," Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.",102
2672,ELAINE," Oh, hi honey.",102
2673,ELAINE, Oh it was such a great night.,102
2674,JERRY, And did they suspect anything?,102
2675,ELAINE," No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.",102
2676,JERRY, And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.,102
2677,ELAINE, Oh it was such a great night. Oh.,102
2678,JERRY, You said that already.,102
2679,ELAINE, Oh I did?,102
2680,JERRY, Yeah.,102
2681,ELAINE, Oh.,102
2682,JERRY, Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?,102
2683,ELAINE, He's incredible.,102
2684,JERRY," Yeah, but?",102
2685,ELAINE," Yeah, I know.",102
2686,JERRY, So?,102
2687,ELAINE, What?,102
2688,JERRY, Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?,102
2689,ELAINE, Well it did occur to me.,102
2690,JERRY, You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.,102
2691,ELAINE, Why? Is it irrevocable?,102
2692,JERRY, Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.,102
2693,ELAINE, We've got a good team.,102
2694,JERRY," Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.",102
2695,ELAINE, Why can't he play for us?,102
2696,JERRY, They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.,102
2697,ELAINE, We just got along *so* great.,102
2698,JERRY, Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.,102
2699,ELAINE," No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.",102
2700,JERRY, You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.,102
2701,ELAINE, I realize that.,102
2702,JERRY, Are you that desperate?,102
2703,ELAINE, Yes I am.,102
2704,JERRY," So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.",102
2705,JERRY, What are you looking for?,102
2706,KRAMER, Tupperware.,102
2707,JERRY, Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.,102
2708,KRAMER," I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.",102
2709,JERRY, What about a plastic bag?,102
2710,KRAMER, You must be kidding.,102
2711,JERRY, What is the difference?,102
2712,KRAMER," The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.",102
2713,GEORGE, So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.,102
2714,KRAMER," Oh yeah, you talked to her.",102
2715,GEORGE, Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.,102
2716,KRAMER, Yeah well we go way back.,102
2717,GEORGE, Why didn't anything happen between you two?,102
2718,KRAMER, Who's to say it didn't?,102
2719,JERRY, So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?,102
2720,GEORGE, Yes I did.,102
2721,JERRY, What did you say to her?,102
2722,GEORGE, What do you think I said?,102
2723,JERRY, I don't know.,102
2724,GEORGE, I told her the truth.,102
2725,JERRY, As you see it?,102
2726,GEORGE," Yes, as I see it.",102
2727,JERRY," Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?",102
2728,GEORGE, What hat?,102
2729,JERRY," You know, you're little hair hat there.",102
2730,GEORGE, No.,102
2731,JERRY, Don't you think she could tell?,102
2732,KRAMER," No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.",102
2733,JERRY, Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.,102
2734,GEORGE, You only think that because you know me.,102
2735,JERRY, Have you noticed people staring at your head?,102
2736,GEORGE, I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.,102
2737,JERRY, Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.,102
2738,KRAMER," No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.",102
2739,GEORGE," Look, I guarantee she won't know.",102
2740,KRAMER," Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.",102
2741,JERRY," Oh, I'll split a cab with you.",102
2742,KRAMER, Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.,102
2743,HOMELESS MAN, Hey that's my coffee!,102
2744,JERRY, Hi Sarge.,102
2745,TIERNEY," Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. Some of our lineup decoys didn't show. Hey any of you guys want to be in the lineup? Make a quick 50 bucks?",102
2746,KRAMER, Sure. I will.,102
2747,TIERNEY, Perfect. Just go over there with officer Lampert.,102
2748,SPEAKER," All of you, turn to the left.",102
2749,SPEAKER, The left.,102
2750,SPEAKER, Now turn to the right.,102
2751,GEORGE,"  Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.",102
2752,DENISE, George?,102
2753,GEORGE, Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.,102
2754,DENISE, Likewise. Have you been waiting long?,102
2755,GEORGE," No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.",102
2756,DENISE," Good, good.",102
2757,GEORGE, Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.,102
2758,JERRY, What's that?,102
2759,TIERNEY, A polygraph. It's what you civilians call a lie detector test.,102
2760,JERRY," Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?",102
2761,TIERNEY, If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up here. A certain cast member of Melrose Place.,102
2762,JERRY, Really.,102
2763,TIERNEY, Have you ever seen the show?,102
2764,JERRY, No.,102
2765,TIERNEY, You can admit it Jerry. It's okay.,102
2766,JERRY, I admit it. I don't watch it.,102
2767,TIERNEY," Hey Lou, maybe we should put him on the poly.",102
2768,JERRY, The poly?,102
2769,TIERNEY, Yeah. I think you've seen it.,102
2770,ELAINE, Melrose Place?,102
2771,JERRY, Yes. Melrose Place.,102
2772,ELAINE, I just didn't know you watched that.,102
2773,JERRY, Well I do.,102
2774,ELAINE, I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.,102
2775,JERRY, Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.,102
2776,ELAINE, You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...,102
2777,JERRY," And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.",102
2778,ELAINE, Why? Why were you so embarrassed?,102
2779,JERRY, The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.,102
2780,ELAINE, That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?,102
2781,JERRY, It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.,102
2782,ELAINE, So what are you going to do?,102
2783,JERRY, I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.,102
2784,ELAINE," Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?",102
2785,JERRY," Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?",102
2786,ELAINE, Oh god this tastes terrible.,102
2787,JERRY, Did you shake it up?,102
2788,ELAINE, No.,102
2789,JERRY, You gotta shake it up.,102
2790,ELAINE, No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.,102
2791,JERRY," Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.",102
2792,ELAINE," So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.",102
2793,JERRY, So tonight are you going to make the move?,102
2794,ELAINE," Yeah, I think I might.",102
2795,JERRY, Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?,102
2796,GEORGE, That's an interesting question.,102
2797,JERRY, How so?,102
2798,GEORGE, How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!,102
2799,ELAINE, What do you mean bald?,102
2800,GEORGE, What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.,102
2801,JERRY, She's bald?,102
2802,GEORGE, She's bald.,102
2803,ELAINE, Oh come on.,102
2804,GEORGE, Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was  hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.,102
2805,ELAINE, Well maybe she got a haircut or something.,102
2806,GEORGE," Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says ""Give me the Larry Fine.""",102
2807,JERRY, Women go bald?,102
2808,ELAINE," Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.",102
2809,JERRY, Hey.,102
2810,KRAMER, Hey.,102
2811,GEORGE, You fixed me up with a bald woman.,102
2812,KRAMER, Bald?,102
2813,GEORGE," Yeah, that's right.",102
2814,ELAINE, Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.,102
2815,GEORGE, So?,102
2816,ELAINE,  You're bald!,102
2817,GEORGE, No I'm not. I *was* bald.,102
2818,GEORGE, Elaine.,102
2819,GEORGE," No, no, no Elaine.",102
2820,ELAINE,  I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.,102
2821,GEORGE, Nooooo.,102
2822,ROBERT," Hahaha, why'd you start that fight with me?",102
2823,ELAINE, Well I figured that's what couples do.,102
2824,ROBERT, You almost convinced me we were a couple.,102
2825,ELAINE, Well it was easy. Really.,102
2826,ROBERT," Well good night, I'll call you tomorrow.",102
2827,ELAINE," Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?",102
2828,ROBERT, Upstairs?,102
2829,ELAINE, Yeah. Upstairs?,102
2830,ROBERT, Elaine...,102
2831,ELAINE," I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?",102
2832,ROBERT, Changing teams?,102
2833,ELAINE, Have you ever thought about it?,102
2834,ROBERT, But I'm a starting shortstop.,102
2835,ELAINE," Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*.",102
2836,GEORGE," I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.",102
2837,JERRY, Good to have you back.,102
2838,GEORGE, And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.,102
2839,JERRY, She's as good as anybody else.,102
2840,GEORGE, Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.,102
2841,JERRY, Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.,102
2842,GEORGE, Going to need a little more coffee here.,102
2843,JERRY," So George, how do I beat this lie detector?",102
2844,GEORGE," I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.",102
2845,JERRY," Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.",102
2846,GEORGE," Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, ""Teach me to sing like you.""",102
2847,JERRY," All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.",102
2848,GEORGE," Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.",102
2849,ELAINE," Hey, I did it.",102
2850,JERRY, What?,102
2851,ELAINE, I turned him. He defected.,102
2852,JERRY, Get out!  How? How did you do that?,102
2853,ELAINE, Because I'm a *woman*.  Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.,102
2854,JERRY," Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said ""Too bad he's gay"".",102
2855,ELAINE," Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.",102
2856,LOU, What's your name?,102
2857,JERRY, Jerry Seinfeld.,102
2858,LOU, What is your address?,102
2859,JERRY, 129 West 81st street.,102
2860,LOU, Did Kimberly steal Jo's baby?,102
2861,JERRY, I don't know.,102
2862,LOU, Did Billy sleep with Allison's best friend?,102
2863,JERRY, I don't know.,102
2864,LOU," Did Jane's finance kidnap Sydney and take her to Las Vegas? And if so, did she enjoy it?",102
2865,JERRY, I don't know.,102
2866,LOU, Did Jane sleep with Michael again?,102
2867,JERRY,"  Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.",102
2868,JERRY, He went back? What do you mean he went back?,102
2869,ELAINE, He went back.,102
2870,JERRY," I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.",102
2871,ELAINE," Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.",102
2872,JERRY, You can't. That's why they lose very few players.,102
2873,ELAINE," Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.",102
2874,JERRY," Well there's always a place for you, on our team.",102
2875,ELAINE, Yeah.  Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?,102
2876,JERRY, Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.,102
2877,ELAINE, Okay.,102
2878,JERRY, Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.,102
2879,ELAINE," Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.",102
2880,GEORGE, Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.,102
2881,ELAINE, What is the matter?,102
2882,GEORGE," I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.",102
2883,KRAMER, Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?,102
2884,ELAINE," I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.",102
2885,JERRY," All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.",102
2886,JERRY," Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.",102
2887,KRAMER," Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.",102
2888,MAN, I've got an eyewitness to that jewelry store break-in. Come here. Do you recognize anybody in the lineup?,102
2889,HOMELESS MAN," That's the guy officer. The guy there in the middle. The tall guy with the, with the high hair. I'd recognize him anywhere.",102
2890,MAN," Hey you, you with the high hair, step forward.",102
2891,KRAMER, Me?,102
2892,JERRY,"Now, I was thinking the other day about hair, and that the weird Thing about it, is that people will touch other people's hair. You will actually kiss another human being, right on the head. But, if one of those hairs should somehow be able to get out of that skull, and go off on its own, it is now the vilest, most disgusting thing that you can encounter. The same hair. People freak out.  ""There was a hair, in the egg salad!""",103
2893,GEORGE, Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?,103
2894,JERRY, I would think.,103
2895,GEORGE," So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?",103
2896,JERRY,  You don't flamenco on the first date.,103
2897,GEORGE," Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.",103
2898,JERRY, Yeah? Would you do it?,103
2899,GEORGE," Yes, I think I would.",103
2900,JERRY," Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.",103
2901,JERRY," Hello.  Oh, hi Nana.  What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it.  Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.",103
2902,JERRY, I have to go over to my grandmother's.,103
2903,GEORGE, What for?,103
2904,JERRY, I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.,103
2905,GEORGE," So, what, no lunch?",103
2906,JERRY," No, we have time.",103
2907,GEORGE, Oh. How's she doing?,103
2908,JERRY," Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.",103
2909,GEORGE," Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.",103
2910,JERRY, Like toothpaste?,103
2911,GEORGE, Ya-hah.,103
2912,JERRY, There's a squeeze ketchup.,103
2913,GEORGE, I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.,103
2914,JERRY," Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?",103
2915,GEORGE, Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.,103
2916,JERRY, I really don't see the difference.,103
2917,GEORGE," Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.",103
2918,JERRY, It's subtle.,103
2919,GEORGE," Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?",103
2920,JERRY,"  Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.",103
2921,GEORGE, What?,103
2922,JERRY," Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.",103
2923,GEORGE," Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?",103
2924,JERRY, Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.,103
2925,GEORGE, Really?,103
2926,JERRY," Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.",103
2927,ELAINE,  Hey.,103
2928,GEORGE," You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.",103
2929,JERRY," Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.",103
2930,GEORGE,  Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.,103
2931,JERRY," No, I told you I admire your hearing.",103
2932,JERRY," No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.",103
2933,ELAINE,"  Wendy, George.  Wendy.",103
2934,GEORGE," You're uh, physical therapist, right?",103
2935,WENDY, Yes.,103
2936,GEORGE," You know, I got this little swelling right here.  It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?",103
2937,ELAINE,  George.,103
2938,WENDY, Have you tried heat and ice on it?,103
2939,GEORGE,"  Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.",103
2940,WENDY," Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for you a little.",103
2941,GEORGE,  Oh! Okay.,103
2942,WENDY, Let me give you my card.,103
2943,GEORGE," Oh, thank you.",103
2944,WENDY," Well, I'll see you guys later.  Nice meeting you. Bye Elaine.",103
2945,ELAINE, Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.,103
2946,WENDY, Bye Jerry.,103
2947,JERRY, Bye.,103
2948,ELAINE,  What did you do that for?,103
2949,GEORGE, What?,103
2950,ELAINE,  Ask about your arm.,103
2951,GEORGE, I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.,103
2952,ELAINE, She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.,103
2953,GEORGE, Why not?,103
2954,ELAINE," Because, it is what she does.",103
2955,GEORGE," I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions.  They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office.  When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!",103
2956,ELAINE," George, you got a little something, right here.",103
2957,GEORGE,  People think they're so important...,103
2958,JERRY,"  Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.",103
2959,ELAINE, Why?,103
2960,JERRY," Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.",103
2961,GEORGE,  What're you getting?,103
2962,JERRY,"  And what's with that hairdo, by the way?",103
2963,ELAINE," Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.",103
2964,JERRY, She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.,103
2965,ELAINE," Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.",103
2966,JERRY, Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.,103
2967,ELAINE, Yeah. Hah.,103
2968,GEORGE," Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.",103
2969,ELAINE," No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.",103
2970,JERRY," What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.",103
2971,ELAINE,"  Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...",103
2972,ELAINE,  ...Kramer.,103
2973,KRAMER," Hello, boys and girls.",103
2974,JERRY, Speak of the devil.,103
2975,KRAMER," Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.",103
2976,JERRY, What for?,103
2977,KRAMER," Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.",103
2978,JERRY, Why?,103
2979,KRAMER," So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.",103
2980,JERRY,"  I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.",103
2981,KRAMER," Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say ""Hey, Carl!"" and he says ""Hey, Jerry!"" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.",103
2982,JERRY,"  Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.",103
2983,KRAMER,  You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?,103
2984,ELAINE,  Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.,103
2985,LEO, Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic squeeze containers?,103
2986,LEO,  Jerry! Hello!,103
2987,JERRY," Hello, uncle Leo!",103
2988,LEO, What're you doing here?,103
2989,JERRY, Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.,103
2990,LEO," Yeah, me too.",103
2991,NANA, Hello Jerry.,103
2992,JERRY, Hi Nana.,103
2993,LEO, Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?,103
2994,JERRY, Yes.  Yes of course.,103
2995,NANA," Ha, well, here's the bottle.",103
2996,LEO,  I'll do it.,103
2997,JERRY,"  What're you doing, I got it.",103
2998,LEO, Give it to me.,103
2999,JERRY, Will you stop it.,103
3000,LEO," Jerry, will you give me the bottle?",103
3001,JERRY, Uncle Leo!  Alright! Take it!,103
3002,NANA, You should let Buddy open it.,103
3003,LEO, Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago.,103
3004,NANA," Leo, did you give Helen the fifty dollars?",103
3005,LEO, What fifty dollars?,103
3006,NANA," Your father won a thousand dollars at the track last week, and he gave you a hundred, and you were supposed to give fifty dollars to your sister.",103
3007,LEO," Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two.",103
3008,LEO,  Believe me. I don't owe your mother fifty dollars.,103
3009,JERRY, I'm just not getting any hot water.,103
3010,JULIO," Hey, believe me, I know there's nothing worse than when your shower's not working. I'm gonna take care of it as soon as I can, Jerry.",103
3011,JERRY," Thanks, Julio.",103
3012,JULIO, Awright.,103
3013,JERRY, Huh?,103
3014,KRAMER,"  Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!",103
3015,JERRY, What's going on here?,103
3016,KRAMER,"  Ohh, nothing, nothing.",103
3017,JERRY,"  Well, then what're you doing?",103
3018,KRAMER," Oh, I, I need a pen.",103
3019,JERRY, What for?,103
3020,KRAMER," Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.",103
3021,JERRY,"  You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?",103
3022,KRAMER, You got that straight.,103
3023,JERRY," I told you, forget it.",103
3024,KRAMER," Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!",103
3025,JERRY, You're robbing me.,103
3026,KRAMER," Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.",103
3027,ELAINE, Wha... W.. Are you going home?,103
3028,KRAMER, Yeah.,103
3029,ELAINE," Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?",103
3030,KRAMER, Why?,103
3031,ELAINE, No reason.  Just wanna see you again.,103
3032,JERRY,  So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?,103
3033,ELAINE," Yeah, she'll be here any second.",103
3034,JERRY," Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?",103
3035,ELAINE," Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.",103
3036,JERRY," Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track?  Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty?  How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened.  Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.",103
3037,MORTY, Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to over fifty-three years?,103
3038,HELEN," Oh, Morty, please.",103
3039,MORTY," Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...",103
3040,HELEN," Morty, will you stop it!",103
3041,MORTY,"  Well, he's not getting away with this!",103
3042,JERRY, Yeah?,103
3043,WENDY , Wendy.,103
3044,JERRY, Come on up.,103
3045,ELAINE," Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?",103
3046,JERRY," No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.",103
3047,ELAINE, What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?,103
3048,JERRY," It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.",103
3049,ELAINE, How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?,103
3050,JERRY," Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.",103
3051,ELAINE,  That's her. That's her.,103
3052,JERRY,  Hi Wendy.,103
3053,WENDY," Oh, hi Jerry.",103
3054,JERRY,  Would you like something to drink?,103
3055,WENDY, Sure.,103
3056,JERRY,  There you go.,103
3057,WENDY,  Ah.,103
3058,JERRY," Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.",103
3059,JERRY," So, how's everything going?",103
3060,WENDY," Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other day, and then yesterday he cancelled on me.",103
3061,JERRY," Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.",103
3062,ELAINE," Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.",103
3063,KRAMER, Hey! Jerry!,103
3064,JERRY," C'mon, that's not fair!",103
3065,KRAMER, I told you I was gonna get it.,103
3066,JERRY," No, c'mon Kramer.  Gimme that picture.",103
3067,KRAMER,  Aagh. No no no no no.,103
3068,JERRY,"  Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?",103
3069,ELAINE," Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.",103
3070,KRAMER," Oh, hello.",103
3071,WENDY,  Hi.,103
3072,KRAMER,  Yeah.,103
3073,KRAMER,"  You know, I really like that hairdo.",103
3074,WENDY,  Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be time for a change.,103
3075,ELAINE,"  Oh, you were?",103
3076,WENDY," Well, I...",103
3077,KRAMER,"  Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.",103
3078,ELAINE," Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...",103
3079,KRAMER," No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.",103
3080,WENDY," Oh, well.",103
3081,WENDY,"  Oh, ho.",103
3082,WENDY," So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in.",103
3083,ELAINE," Oh, Kramer.",103
3084,WENDY, Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?,103
3085,ELAINE, You wanna go out with him?,103
3086,WENDY," Well, why not?",103
3087,ELAINE," Well, it's just that... uh, I don't...",103
3088,WENDY," What, is there anything wrong with him?",103
3089,WENDY, Elaine?,103
3090,ELAINE, I'm just thinking about the question.,103
3091,GEORGE," You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. ",103
3092,RECEPTIONIST,  She is super. Same time tomorrow.,103
3093,GEORGE,"  Yeah, same time.  There you go.",103
3094,RECEPTIONIST," Oh. Ah, you owe a hundred and fifty.",103
3095,GEORGE, What for?,103
3096,RECEPTIONIST," Well, you cancelled on Tuesday, and our policy is ""twenty-four hours notice, for all cancellations"".",103
3097,GEORGE,"  Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.",103
3098,WENDY, What's the problem?,103
3099,GEORGE,  Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.,103
3100,WENDY," Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy.",103
3101,GEORGE,"  Oh, you have a policy!  The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.",103
3102,RECEPTIONIST, So. Will you be here tomorrow?,103
3103,GEORGE," Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!",103
3104,KRAMER, Hey!  So what d'you think? You like it?,103
3105,JERRY," Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...",103
3106,JERRY, ...You can't put that picture up.,103
3107,KRAMER," Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.",103
3108,STEVE, Hey Cosmo.,103
3109,KRAMER, Hey...,103
3110,KRAMER," ...Steve.  Ah, you see?",103
3111,ELAINE," Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.",103
3112,KRAMER,"  Well, how do you do?",103
3113,MARY," Hello,  Jerry.",103
3114,JERRY," Oh. Hello, uh  Mary.",103
3115,MARY," You know, I've seen you so many times and now we can finally talk to each other.",103
3116,KRAMER,  What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?,103
3117,JERRY,  Yeah.,103
3118,MARY," Jerry. You know, could you help me with a package?",103
3119,JERRY," Oh, sure, yeah.",103
3120,MARY, Thank you.,103
3121,JERRY," Oh, no!",103
3122,JERRY, You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!,103
3123,ELAINE,"  Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee...",103
3124,JERRY, What is so funny?,103
3125,ELAINE," Nothing, nothing. ",103
3126,JERRY," Hello. Oh, hi mom.  What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't!  Alright, I will.  Okay, bye.",103
3127,JERRY,  Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!,103
3128,ELAINE, Why?,103
3129,JERRY,  I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.,103
3130,JOAN, Hi Jerry.  Mmmwah.,103
3131,JERRY,  Hi Joan.,103
3132,JOAN, How you doing?,103
3133,JERRY, Pretty good.,103
3134,JOAN, Just pretty good? Not great?,103
3135,JERRY," Okay, great.",103
3136,JOAN, Are you happy?,103
3137,JERRY," Oh, I'm delighted.",103
3138,JOAN, Okay. Have a nice day.,103
3139,JERRY, You too.,103
3140,LOUISE, Hi Jerry.,103
3141,JERRY," Hi, Louise.",103
3142,KRAMER, Hey.,103
3143,JERRY," Ah, well. Thank you very much!",103
3144,KRAMER, For what?,103
3145,JERRY,"  For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!",103
3146,KRAMER," You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.",103
3147,JERRY, Family?,103
3148,KRAMER, Yeah.,103
3149,JERRY," You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.",103
3150,RECEPTIONIST," Oh, hi. Mister Costanza, we were trying to get in touch with you. Wendy can't make her appointment.",103
3151,GEORGE, What d'you mean?,103
3152,RECEPTIONIST, She had some personal affair she had to attend to. I left a message on your machine. You didn't get it?,103
3153,GEORGE, When did you leave the message?,103
3154,RECEPTIONIST, Few hours ago.,103
3155,GEORGE,"  Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.",103
3156,RECEPTIONIST," Look, Mister Costanza...",103
3157,GEORGE," Will that be cash, or cheque?",103
3158,WENDY, I am really glad I took the day off.,103
3159,ELAINE," Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing.",103
3160,WENDY, Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.,103
3161,ELAINE," Ugh, the hell with 'em.",103
3162,ELAINE, What're you stopping here for?,103
3163,WENDY, I'm dropping you off.,103
3164,ELAINE,"  Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.",103
3165,WENDY," Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the way around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one way...",103
3166,ELAINE," Yeah, but it's only three blocks.",103
3167,WENDY, Right. It's only three blocks.,103
3168,ELAINE,"  Alright, well...",103
3169,ELAINE," She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?",103
3170,JERRY," Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.",103
3171,ELAINE," I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says ""Well, this is as far as I can take you.""",103
3172,JERRY," I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.",103
3173,ELAINE," I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.",103
3174,JERRY, You should have her work on it for you.,103
3175,ELAINE," Yeah, alright, I gotta go.",103
3176,MAR, Hi Jerry.,103
3177,JERRY, Hi Mary.,103
3178,JERRY," Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....",103
3179,JERRY, ...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.,103
3180,LOU, Hi Jerry.,103
3181,JERRY, Hi Louise...,103
3182,JERRY," ...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore.  I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.",103
3183,JERRY,  Thank you for your cooperation.,103
3184,JERRY, Hello.,103
3185,HELEN , Jerry?,103
3186,JERRY," Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?",103
3187,HELEN," Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.",103
3188,MORTY," No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up.",103
3189,HELEN," Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.",103
3190,JERRY," Okay, I will.",103
3191,MORTY," D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund for fifty-three years...",103
3192,KRAMER, What's up?,103
3193,JERRY,"  Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.",103
3194,KRAMER, Oh.,103
3195,JERRY," Hey, Kramer, look at this.",103
3196,JERRY, Look at my picture!,103
3197,JERRY, I've been defaced!,103
3198,KRAMER," Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.",103
3199,JACK, Hey. Hi Cosmo.,103
3200,KRAMER," Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?",103
3201,JERRY, Hi Jack.,103
3202,JERRY," Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?",103
3203,JULIO," Oh, I see. When you need something done, you're very friendly to people, huh?",103
3204,JERRY,"  No no, that's not true!",103
3205,JULIO,"  Well, I think it is! It's a big building, Seinfeld, maybe I'll get to it someday. After I take care of the people who're civil to each other.",103
3206,NURSE," Yeah, she's upstairs, playing cards.",103
3207,JERRY," You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.",103
3208,NURSE," Well, she seems very happy. She met an old friend who used to live next door to her.",103
3209,JERRY, Buddy?,103
3210,NURSE," Yes, that's his name. He's right over there.",103
3211,WENDY,"  I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some personal business that day.",103
3212,GEORGE,"  Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!",103
3213,WENDY, A delicate genius?,103
3214,GEORGE, Elaine?,103
3215,ELAINE,  George!,103
3216,GEORGE,  Hah. Good luck.,103
3217,WENDY, What's going on?,103
3218,ELAINE,"  Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?",103
3219,WENDY," Oh sure. You have insurance, right?",103
3220,ELAINE,  Insurance? You're charging me?,103
3221,GEORGE," Wednesday? That's your personal business?!  Skiing?!  So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?",103
3222,WENDY, How did you hear that?,103
3223,GEORGE, I hear everything.,103
3224,WENDY," I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere, hmm?",103
3225,ELAINE," Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.",103
3226,GEORGE, Yeah. Let's go.,103
3227,ELAINE,"  And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.",103
3228,WENDY," Why, what's wrong with my hair?",103
3229,ELAINE," Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you?  Uh, tell her.",103
3230,RECEPTIONIST, She's right.,103
3231,JERRY, So you were with him that day at the track?,103
3232,BUDDY, Oh yeah. He won a thousand dollars. His son was there too.,103
3233,JERRY, Leo?,103
3234,BUDDY," Yeah, that's it. Leo. Ooh, what an obnoxious little kid. He used to steal my soda bottles. and cash 'em in for the deposits, uh?",103
3235,JERRY, Is that so?,103
3236,BUDDY," And, after your grandfather hit the daily double, he gave him a hundred dollars, and told him to give fifty to his sister. His sister? Why I tell you he shoulda give it to me for all the bottles he took!",103
3237,JERRY," Well, that's very interesting.",103
3238,JERRY,  Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours.  You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.,103
3239,LEO,  One second...,103
3240,JERRY,  You're busted!,103
3241,JERRY," Hey, Steve. How you doing?",103
3242,JERRY," Hey, Jeff. What's happening?",103
3243,JERRY," Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.",103
3244,JERRY," Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!",103
3245,MARY,"  Look, why don't you do everybody a favour, and just get out of this building?  Nobody wants you here. Nobody!",103
3246,JEFF, Hi Mary.,103
3247,MARY, Hi Jeff. How are you?,103
3248,MARY, Hi Pete. How you doing?,103
3249,PETE," Hey, let's go get some coffee.",103
3250,JEFF, Great idea.,103
3251,MARY," Oh, that'd be great.",103
3252,JERRY," Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...",103
3253,KRAMER, Hi.,103
3254,JERRY, Hey. Could I use your shower?,103
3255,KRAMER," What, again? You took one this morning.",103
3256,JERRY,"  I got a date. C'mon, please.",103
3257,KRAMER, I know but I...  Little problem.,103
3258,KRAMER,  Wendy here?,103
3259,KRAMER," No no no. She changed her hairstyle,  it's terrible. No, we're done.",103
3260,GUY, I'll go get some more beer.,103
3261,KRAMER," Oh yeah, yeah, great.  And get some of those blue corn chips.",103
3262,KRAMER, Hey.,103
3263,STEFANIE, Hi Cosmo.,103
3264,KRAMER, Hi.,103
3265,STEFANIE,  Mmmwah.,103
3266,KRAMER," Ooh, I like that.",103
3267,JERRY,  Who's that?,103
3268,KRAMER, Stefanie. 2-G.,103
3269,JERRY, Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.,103
3270,KRAMER," Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.",103
3271,JERRY,"  Oh, yeah, I understand.",103
3272,JERRY,"You remember a few years ago in New York, we had the doorman strike? They have a union, in the fancy buildings, and they went out on strike. Now you would think, if any group of people would not wanna demonstrate what life would be like without them, it would be doormen.  ""Let's see how they do without us!"" There's no doorman, people open the door, they walk in, it's... you know. Who's gonna walk out next? The guys who clean your windshield at the traffic light, with the dirty rag?  ""We demand shorter yellows, and longer reds!""",104
3273,DOORMAN," Whoah, whoah, whoah.  May I help you?",104
3274,JERRY,"  Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.",104
3275,DOORMAN,  Benes?  No-one here by that name.,104
3276,JERRY," Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.",104
3277,DOORMAN," Oh. House-sitting, mmm.",104
3278,JERRY, Yeah.,104
3279,DOORMAN," What're you, the boyfriend? Here for a... quickie?",104
3280,JERRY, Can I just go up?,104
3281,DOORMAN," Oh, I get it. Why waste time making small talk with the doorman? I should just shut up and do my job, opening the door for you.",104
3282,JERRY, How 'bout those Knicks?,104
3283,DOORMAN," Oh, I see. On the sports page...",104
3284,JERRY, Yeah.,104
3285,DOORMAN," ...What makes you think I wasn't reading the Wall Street page? Oh, I know, because I'm the uneducated doorman.",104
3286,KRAMER," So, you think your parents'll get back together?",104
3287,GEORGE," I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.",104
3288,KRAMER," Hey, George, stick 'em up.",104
3289,GEORGE, What?,104
3290,KRAMER, For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.,104
3291,GEORGE, Why?,104
3292,KRAMER, So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.,104
3293,KRAMER," Awright, hands up, porky!",104
3294,KRAMER," That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!",104
3295,KRAMER,  Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!,104
3296,GEORGE," Alright, that's enough.",104
3297,KRAMER," I'll tell you when it's enough!  Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!",104
3298,ELAINE," Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.",104
3299,JERRY, I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.,104
3300,ELAINE, What guy?,104
3301,JERRY, The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?,104
3302,ELAINE, Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier.  Whugh!  Ha-ha.,104
3303,JERRY," Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?",104
3304,ELAINE,  I...,104
3305,JERRY, We'll still make the movie.,104
3306,ELAINE,"  Okay, okay.",104
3307,GEORGE," What'd you do today, dad?",104
3308,FRANK," Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi.",104
3309,GEORGE, I don't have a hi-fi.,104
3310,FRANK, Didn't I give you my old record player?,104
3311,GEORGE,  I gave it to Cosmo.,104
3312,FRANK, Cosmo? Who's Cosmo?,104
3313,KRAMER, I'm Cosmo.,104
3314,FRANK," Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record.",104
3315,KRAMER,"  One-two, cha-cha-cha.",104
3316,GEORGE,"  Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?",104
3317,FRANK,  Lemme change my shirt.,104
3318,ELAINE," Jerry, it's six.  Let's go.",104
3319,JERRY," Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.",104
3320,ELAINE," No, don't...",104
3321,JERRY,"  Hello?  Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.",104
3322,ELAINE,  Give that to me.,104
3323,ELAINE,  Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?,104
3324,MR. PITT,"  Elaine, are you having a party?",104
3325,ELAINE," A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.",104
3326,JERRY," Alright, he just left. We can go.",104
3327,MR. PITT,  Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone.,104
3328,ELAINE," Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving.  Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.",104
3329,MR. PITT, I need to know what's in the mail.,104
3330,ELAINE," Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.",104
3331,MR. PITT,"  Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to know what's in the mail.",104
3332,ELAINE, Alright.  I can't go.,104
3333,ELAINE," ...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...",104
3334,MR. PITT ,"  Oh, who's on the cover?",104
3335,DOORMAN," Hey, buddy.",104
3336,JERRY,  You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?,104
3337,DOORMAN," Ah, sure. Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table for mother and baby.  No, I live here. That's okay, isn't it?",104
3338,JERRY, So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?,104
3339,DOORMAN, You got a problem with that?,104
3340,JERRY," Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.",104
3341,DOORMAN,"  You really think you're better than me, don't you?!",104
3342,GEORGE, My father opened his shirt...,104
3343,JERRY," Yeah, and?",104
3344,GEORGE,"  Tell him, Kramer.",104
3345,KRAMER,  He had breasts.,104
3346,JERRY," What d'you mean, breasts?",104
3347,GEORGE,  Big breasts!,104
3348,JERRY, So what? A lot of older men have that.,104
3349,KRAMER," No, not these. These were real hooters.",104
3350,GEORGE, I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.,104
3351,KRAMER," Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.",104
3352,GEORGE,"  Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?",104
3353,JERRY," But, your father's not bald.",104
3354,GEORGE," No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.",104
3355,JERRY, Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.,104
3356,KRAMER," You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.",104
3357,GEORGE, You mean like a bra?,104
3358,KRAMER, A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.,104
3359,JERRY," Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?",104
3360,KRAMER," I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.",104
3361,BUXOM WOMAN,"  Hey, we're twins.",104
3362,GEORGE,  What!!,104
3363,BUXOM WOMAN, Our shirts. They're the same.,104
3364,GEORGE," Oh, Huh, imagine that.",104
3365,ELAINE,  What? What'd you say to the doorman?,104
3366,JERRY, What? Nothing.,104
3367,ELAINE,"  He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.",104
3368,JERRY, What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?,104
3369,ELAINE," Hey, did you make the movie?",104
3370,JERRY, No.,104
3371,ELAINE, You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.,104
3372,JERRY," Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?",104
3373,ELAINE, Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?,104
3374,JERRY," Yes, we do.",104
3375,ELAINE, What is wrong with George?,104
3376,JERRY, He's... trying to get something off his chest.,104
3377,GEORGE,"  Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.",104
3378,DOORMAN, Help you?,104
3379,JERRY,  Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.,104
3380,DOORMAN," I traded shifts with the night doorman. He had some personal affairs to attend to. You see, my fellow doorman and I watch out for each other. We don't stab each other in the back, like people in your world.",104
3381,JERRY,"  Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.",104
3382,DOORMAN, You wanna be friends?,104
3383,JERRY, I'd like to be.,104
3384,DOORMAN," Then watch the door for a minute, would you?",104
3385,JERRY, What?,104
3386,DOORMAN," Yeah, I just wanna run and get a beer. I'll be back in a minute.",104
3387,JERRY, Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?,104
3388,DOORMAN," It's not brain surgery. You open the door for people who live here. And, if they don't live here, don't let them in.  Here.  Wear that.",104
3389,JERRY, Oh.,104
3390,JERRY,"  Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!",104
3391,JERRY," Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?",104
3392,MR. GREEN,"  Of course I live here. I've lived here for twenty years. Now, if you don't let me in, I'm going to call the police and have you arrested.",104
3393,JERRY,  You think you're better than me?,104
3394,DELIVERY GUY,  You have to sign for it.,104
3395,JERRY," Oh, right.",104
3396,DELIVERY GUY,"  Hey, how 'bout those Knicks, huh?",104
3397,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah, yeah.",104
3398,KRAMER," Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.",104
3399,FRANK," Thank you, Kramer.",104
3400,KRAMER, Yeah.,104
3401,FRANK,  Put it over there.,104
3402,KRAMER," So, how you feeling?",104
3403,FRANK, Tired.,104
3404,KRAMER, Uh huh. Your back hurt?,104
3405,FRANK, How did you know?,104
3406,KRAMER," Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.",104
3407,FRANK,  Up here?,104
3408,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. Top floor.  Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this.  Mind you, this is just a prototype.",104
3409,FRANK, You want me to wear a bra?!,104
3410,KRAMER," No, no. A bra is for ladies.",104
3411,KRAMER," Meet, the bro.",104
3412,ESTELLE," So, is your father excited about coming home?",104
3413,ESTELLE, George?,104
3414,GEORGE,  Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?,104
3415,ESTELLE, All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?,104
3416,GEORGE," Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.",104
3417,ESTELLE, She was a lovely woman.,104
3418,GEORGE, Yuh. What about physically?,104
3419,ESTELLE, Physically?,104
3420,GEORGE," Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?",104
3421,ESTELLE," Well, you've seen pictures.",104
3422,GEORGE,  You can't tell much from those pictures.,104
3423,ESTELLE, So what?,104
3424,GEORGE," Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?",104
3425,ESTELLE," Big? No, just my height.",104
3426,GEORGE, Bosomy?,104
3427,ESTELLE, Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!,104
3428,GEORGE,"  No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.",104
3429,ESTELLE, Where do you get your genes from?!,104
3430,GEORGE,  That's what I'd like to know.,104
3431,ELAINE, I can't believe you left your post.,104
3432,JERRY, He left me there. You see the mind games?,104
3433,ELAINE,"  Hey, what's up? What's going on here?",104
3434,ELAINE,"  Jerry, let's get out of here.",104
3435,JERRY, Yeah.,104
3436,ESTELLE,"  Oh, my god!",104
3437,ELAINE, What were you doing watching the door anyway?,104
3438,JERRY, He asked me to. We were getting along.,104
3439,ELAINE,"  You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.",104
3440,JERRY," Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!",104
3441,ELAINE,"  Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.",104
3442,JERRY," Alright, well what if we say...",104
3443,ELAINE," Alright,  here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up...",104
3444,JERRY, I came to pick you up.,104
3445,ELAINE, Yeah. That's what I just said.,104
3446,JERRY, I know. I was just...,104
3447,ELAINE," Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.",104
3448,JERRY," Alright, well. Just, start again, then.",104
3449,ELAINE," Okay, you came to pick me up at...",104
3450,JERRY, Right.,104
3451,ELAINE, You see? Again.,104
3452,JERRY, What? I said right.,104
3453,ELAINE," Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.",104
3454,JERRY, But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.,104
3455,ELAINE,  So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!,104
3456,JERRY, But I don't know if this is gonna work.,104
3457,ELAINE,  Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!,104
3458,JERRY, Okay.,104
3459,ELAINE, Good. Now fix me a drink.,104
3460,KRAMER, How's that feel?,104
3461,FRANK, This feels very comfortable.,104
3462,KRAMER, You see?,104
3463,FRANK, I feel ten years younger.,104
3464,KRAMER," Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.",104
3465,FRANK," And I can breathe easier, too.",104
3466,KRAMER," I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?",104
3467,FRANK, Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business.,104
3468,KRAMER,"  Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.",104
3469,FRANK, Let's do it!,104
3470,FRANK," Except, we gotta do something about the name.",104
3471,KRAMER," Why, what's wrong with bro?",104
3472,FRANK," No, bro's no good. Too ethnic.",104
3473,KRAMER," Alright, you got something better?",104
3474,FRANK, How 'bout uh... the mansiere?,104
3475,KRAMER, Mansiere?,104
3476,FRANK," That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?",104
3477,GEORGE,"  Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.",104
3478,FRANK," Hey George, what d'you like better? The bro, or the mansiere?",104
3479,GEORGE, Dad. We need to talk.,104
3480,DOORMAN," I had to use the bathroom, so I asked this guy to watch the door for a few minutes.",104
3481,MRS. PAYTON, Why should I believe you?,104
3482,DOORMAN,"  Actually, it was her friend.",104
3483,MRS. PAYTON," I was just speaking to the doorman here, about the couch robbery.",104
3484,ELAINE," Oh really?  The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?",104
3485,MRS. PAYTON, He said he asked a friend of yours to watch the door.,104
3486,ELAINE,"  Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?",104
3487,DOORMAN, Well... what do we have here? Perhaps Miss Benes could explain why a Jerry Seinfeld signed for this package  at the exact same time the couch was stolen.,104
3488,ELAINE,"  He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it.  You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.",104
3489,ELAINE,  Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.,104
3490,JERRY, You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?,104
3491,ELAINE,  There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.,104
3492,JERRY,  Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!,104
3493,ELAINE, Is it possible we were victims of a sting?,104
3494,JERRY, I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.,104
3495,DOORMAN, No. I was just messing with his head.,104
3496,ELAINE," Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?",104
3497,ELAINE, We have to replace the couch.,104
3498,JERRY, Now we have to buy a new couch?!,104
3499,GEORGE,  Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?,104
3500,JERRY, The one with the Poppie stain?!,104
3501,GEORGE," Yeah, sure.  Then my father will have no place to sleep.  He's gotta move out.",104
3502,ELAINE, But it's got a pee-stain on it.,104
3503,GEORGE," No, the cushion's turned over.",104
3504,ELAINE,  I guess.,104
3505,GEORGE,  Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!,104
3506,KRAMER," Now, it's called the bro.",104
3507,FRANK," Or, the mansiere.",104
3508,KRAMER," Yeah, but I prefer the bro.",104
3509,FRANK, I like mansiere.,104
3510,FARKUS," Well, I have to tell you, it's a very interesting idea.",104
3511,KRAMER, Yeah.,104
3512,FARKUS," You know, selling bras exclusively to women, we're really only utilising fifty percent of the market.",104
3513,FRANK,"  That's what we figured, huh?",104
3514,KRAMER,  I told you.,104
3515,FARKUS," And, to be perfectly frank, I've always felt I could use some support. I know, when I'm wearing Banlon, there appears to be some jiggling.",104
3516,FRANK,  I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon.,104
3517,FARKUS,"  So uh, what d'you see in the back? Hooks? Velcro? What?",104
3518,KRAMER, Uh.,104
3519,FRANK, Definitely velcro.,104
3520,KRAMER," Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.",104
3521,KRAMER, I think we've all experienced that.,104
3522,FARKUS, Summer nights.,104
3523,KRAMER,  Very funny.,104
3524,FARKUS," Well, I still have to talk about this to Mr. Degrunmont...",104
3525,KRAMER," Of course, yes.",104
3526,FARKUS," ...But, barring any unforeseen developments, gentlemen, I think we're sitting on a winner.",104
3527,FARKUS,"  Frank, I wanna tell you how sorry I am to hear about you and Estelle separating.",104
3528,FRANK," Oh, thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on.",104
3529,FARKUS,"  I've always been very fond of Estelle. Beautiful woman. I uh, I hope you don't think uh, this is out of line, but would it be okay with you, if I were to ask her out?",104
3530,FRANK,  You wanna go out with my wife?!  Where do you get the nerve to ask me something like that?!,104
3531,FARKUS," Oh, no, Frank, I was just saying...",104
3532,FRANK," I know what you're saying, and I know what you're thinking!!",104
3533,FARKUS," No, Frank...",104
3534,FRANK," C'mon, Cosmo, I'm not doing business with this guy.",104
3535,KRAMER , Frank!,104
3536,GEORGE, Jerry took the couch back.,104
3537,FRANK, He took it back? Didn't you tell him I was using it?,104
3538,GEORGE," Oh, I pleaded with him.",104
3539,FRANK, Where am I supposed to sleep?,104
3540,GEORGE," Well, I took the liberty of packing your things.  Mom's coming to get you.",104
3541,KRAMER," I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?",104
3542,FRANK, What stain?,104
3543,KRAMER," Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain.",104
3544,FRANK,  You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch?,104
3545,GEORGE,"  No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.",104
3546,FRANK,"  But, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!!",104
3547,GEORGE," Ah! There's mom, there's mom.",104
3548,ESTELLE, Is it safe to come in?,104
3549,GEORGE," Oh, of course.  Of course.",104
3550,ESTELLE, You're not having any of your transvestite parties?,104
3551,FRANK, Will you stop it?,104
3552,ESTELLE,"  I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!",104
3553,FRANK," Here, Cosmo...",104
3554,KRAMER," Oh, hey.",104
3555,FRANK, ...You can have the hi-fi.  I don't need it now...,104
3556,KRAMER," Awright, I got it.",104
3557,FRANK, ...I got one at home.,104
3558,ESTELLE," Alright, let's go.",104
3559,FRANK, We'll go out for dinner tonight.,104
3560,ESTELLE," I can't tonight, I'm busy.",104
3561,FRANK," What d'you mean, busy?",104
3562,ESTELLE, I'm having dinner with someone.,104
3563,FRANK, With whom?,104
3564,ESTELLE, Sid Farkus.,104
3565,FRANK,  Sid Farkus?! You're not having dinner with a bra salesman.,104
3566,ESTELLE," Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em.",104
3567,FRANK," Okay, that's it! I'm not coming home!",104
3568,GEORGE,  But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!,104
3569,FRANK, We'll work something out.,104
3570,GERMAN WOMAN," Stop him! Ja, ja, ja, it's him!",104
3571,GERMAN WOMAN, Stop that man! It's him.,104
3572,GERMAN WOMAN," Somebody, stop him! Please, quick. Stop, it's him. I know, I know. Help. Stop him.",104
3573,HORST," Hey, hey.  That record player is not yours.",104
3574,KRAMER," Now, look. Somebody gave it to me.",104
3575,HORST, You're a thief. We have proof.,104
3576,HORST, What is that?,104
3577,KRAMER," The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.",104
3578,HORST, How does it connect in the back? With a hook?,104
3579,KRAMER," Oh, no, no.  Here, velcro.",104
3580,HORST,"  Ooh,  ...keine problem, ah?",104
3581,HORST," Is gut, ja?",104
3582,MRS. PAYTON," Well, I suppose it'll have to do.",104
3583,ELAINE, It's a beautiful couch.,104
3584,JERRY, It's hardly been used.,104
3585,JERRY, Poppie!,104
3586,POPPIE," Oh, hello, Jerry.",104
3587,JERRY, What're you doing here?,104
3588,POPPIE, Visiting my friend.,104
3589,JERRY," Ohh. Hey, how you feeling?",104
3590,POPPIE," Oh, much better, much better. The doctors say I cannot have no aggravation.",104
3591,JERRY, Hmm.,104
3592,POPPIE," So, I sell the restaurant, uh? I just take it easy. See, if I get excited, 'ats aggravated my condition. The last time I got aggravated, was in the restaurant. With your friend.",104
3593,POPPIE," She start the big fight, about abortion.",104
3594,POPPIE, It's you! It's you!,104
3595,ELAINE, Wha...?,104
3596,POPPIE, You! I... I gotta sit down!,104
3597,JERRY," No, Poppie! No!!",104
3598,FRANK, Kasha?,104
3599,GEORGE," No. Thanks, dad.",104
3600,GEORGE," "" That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height...What was his name again?""",105
3601,JERRY," ""Jimmy""",105

Hey look at this. you know I got a new system for eating these things. `I used to peel off the chocolate now I turn them upside down , I eat the cake first and save the frosting for the end.

3902,KRAMER," "" Ah! here here Listen...Dear Penthouse, I want to tell you about an experience I recently had. As an avid reader I've always wondered if the letters  are I'm a dentist and one afternoon my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients. Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if ......... ",105
3903,JERRY, I hear you're going out with David Putty.,107
3904,ELAINE," Yeah. What, is it a problem?",107
3905,JERRY," Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.",107
3906,ELAINE," Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.",107
3907,JERRY," Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.",107
3908,ELAINE," Oh, god.",107
3909,JERRY," The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.",107
3910,ELAINE," Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.",107
3911,JERRY, All right.,107
3912,GEORGE," Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.",107
3913,ESTELLE, So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.,107
3914,GEORGE," You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.",107
3915,ESTELLE," So, I'm getting an eye job.",107
3916,GEORGE," An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.",107
3917,ESTELLE," Georgie, I'm a divorcee.",107
3918,GEORGE," No, you're not a divorcee. Youÿre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.",107
3919,ESTELLE," Well, I'm out there, George.",107
3920,GEORGE," No, you're not out there.",107
3921,ESTELLE," I am, too!",107
3922,GEORGE," You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!",107
3923,ESTELLE," Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.",107
3924,GEORGE, Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---,107
3925,ESTELLE, This is the only time the doctor *has*.,107
3926,GEORGE," Kramer, hey, hey! ",107
3927,KRAMER," Hi, little buddy.",107
3928,GEORGE, Come on over and sit down.,107
3929,KRAMER," Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.",107
3930,GEORGE," No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...",107
3931,KRAMER," All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? ",107
3932,ESTELLE," So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job.",107
3933,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.",107
3934,GEORGE, She's not out there!,107
3935,KRAMER," So, who is your doctor?",107
3936,ESTELLE," Uh, Bakersoll.",107
3937,KRAMER, . He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.,107
3938,GEORGE," Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?",107
3939,KRAMER, Tuesday? Uh...,107
3940,GEORGE, Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.,107
3941,ESTELLE," Oh, I don't care.",107
3942,KRAMER," Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.",107
3943,GEORGE," Well, giddy-up!",107
3944,KRAMER," Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.",107
3945,CLERK, Kramer....  All right...,107
3946,KRAMER, All righty...,107
3947,CLERK," Sign right here, please. ",107
3948,KRAMER,"  Okay. . Thanks.  Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.",107
3949,CLERK, What's your name again?,107
3950,KRAMER, Cosmo Kramer.,107
3951,CLERK,  Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman.,107
3952,KRAMER, No! I'm not the Assman.,107
3953,CLERK," Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.",107
3954,DAVID, How do you feel?,107
3955,ELAINE, Fine.,107
3956,DAVID, Something the matter?,107
3957,ELAINE, No.,107
3958,DAVID, Then what is it?,107
3959,ELAINE," No, nothing.",107
3960,JERRY, Hi.,107
3961,ELAINE, I was with David *Putty* last night.,107
3962,JERRY," Yeah, so.",107
3963,ELAINE, He did the move.,107
3964,JERRY, What move?,107
3965,ELAINE, You know...*the* move.,107
3966,JERRY, Wait a second. *My* move?,107
3967,JERRY, David Putty used *my* move?,107
3968,ELAINE," Yes, yes.",107
3969,JERRY, Are you sure?,107
3970,ELAINE, Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.,107
3971,JERRY, I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.,107
3972,ELAINE, What else did you tell  him.  The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!,107
3973,JERRY," Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.",107
3974,ELAINE, Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?,107
3975,JERRY," Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.",107
3976,ELAINE," Well, wait---wait a second.",107
3977,JERRY, What?,107
3978,ELAINE, Isn't that a little...rash?,107
3979,JERRY, No! He stole my move!,107
3980,ELAINE," Yeah, but...*I* like the move.",107
3981,JERRY," Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.",107
3982,ELAINE," Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!",107
3983,JERRY," Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.",107
3984,ELAINE," You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.",107
3985,JERRY," I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.",107
3986,JERRY, ...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.,107
3987,GEORGE," You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry.  Gimme a bite.",107
3988,JERRY, Can I just get it opened first?,107
3989,GEORGE, I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.,107
3990,JERRY," All right, all right. Here. .",107
3991,GEORGE,"  Oh, that's good. That's very good.",107
3992,JERRY, You feel better?,107
3993,GEORGE," Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.",107
3994,JERRY, Nancy Klopper?,107
3995,GEORGE," Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.",107
3996,JERRY," All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---",107
3997,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.",107
3998,JERRY," It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---",107
3999,GEORGE, You're gonna tell me...or not.,107
4000,JERRY, All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.,107
4001,GEORGE, I got a headboard.,107
4002,JERRY, Is it padded?,107
4003,GEORGE, No.,107
4004,JERRY, Good. How tall is she?,107
4005,GEORGE, Five-foot four. Why?,107
4006,JERRY," You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.",107
4007,GEORGE, I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.,107
4008,JERRY," George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.",107
4009,JERRY," Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.",107
4010,GEORGE, Is it a clockwise swirl?,107
4011,JERRY," I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.",107
4012,KRAMER," Here you go, buddy. .",107
4013,JERRY, What is it?,107
4014,KRAMER, *Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?,107
4015,JERRY, When did you do this?,107
4016,KRAMER," In my spare time. . You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.",107
4017,JERRY, Oh... Why Fusilli?,107
4018,KRAMER, Because *you're* silly. Get it?  Yeah...,107
4019,JERRY," Well, thank you very much.",107
4020,GEORGE," So, did you get your new plates?",107
4021,KRAMER, Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.,107
4022,GEORGE, What do they say?,107
4023,KRAMER, Assman.,107
4024,JERRY, Assman?,107
4025,KRAMER," Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!",107
4026,JERRY," Who would order a license plate that says ""Assman""?",107
4027,GEORGE, Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.,107
4028,JERRY, It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.,107
4029,KRAMER," Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.",107
4030,JERRY, Yeah. Proctologist.,107
4031,GEORGE, Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.,107
4032,KRAMER," Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way",107
4033,KRAMER, Oh! There's my phone. ,107
4034,GEORGE," So, where you gonna stick this ",107
4035,JERRY, I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.,107
4036,JERRY," Hey, David.",107
4037,DAVID," Oh, hi, Jerry.",107
4038,JERRY," Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.",107
4039,DAVID, What move?,107
4040,JERRY, What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.,107
4041,DAVID," You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending.",107
4042,JERRY," The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.",107
4043,DAVID," Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist.",107
4044,JERRY, Swirl.,107
4045,DAVID, Whatever. I don't even do it.,107
4046,JERRY," Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.",107
4047,DAVID," Yeah, that's right.",107
4048,JERRY," You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.",107
4049,DAVID," Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work.",107
4050,JERRY," Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.",107
4051,DAVID," All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take *that* out of town.",107
4052,JERRY, Fine.,107
4053,DAVID, Good!,107
4054,NANCY," Ow, George!  What are you doing?",107
4055,GEORGE,"  Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.",107
4056,NANCY," Well, stop it!",107
4057,GEORGE, You don't like the move?,107
4058,NANCY, No. I don't.,107
4059,GEORGE, You're kidding.,107
4060,NANCY," No, I'm not. It feels like aliens poking at my body.",107
4061,GEORGE, Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.,107
4062,ELAINE," Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!",107
4063,DAVID," No, I'm sorry.",107
4064,ELAINE, What?!!,107
4065,DAVID, I can't do the move.,107
4066,ELAINE, What?,107
4067,DAVID," Oh, he's ruined it for me.",107
4068,ELAINE," Oh, oh, come on, please?",107
4069,DAVID," No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore.",107
4070,ELAINE," Oh, so---so that's it?",107
4071,DAVID, I'll come up with some new stuff.,107
4072,KRAMER," ""Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for."" .",107
4073,DR. BAKERSOLL, I must caution you about one thing. You can't cry for at least ten day. You can ruin the operation.,107
4074,ESTELLE," Oh, okay.",107
4075,DR. BAKERSOLL," Now, is someone coming to pick you up?",107
4076,ESTELLE," Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.",107
4077,SECURITY GUARD, Can I help you?,107
4078,KRAMER," Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer.  Proctology.",107
4079,SECURITY GUARD," Oh, oh, okay. Sure...",107
4080,KRAMER, Thanks. Have a good day.,107
4081,KRAMER, I just can't get over how fantastic you look.,107
4082,ESTELLE," Oh, really?",107
4083,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off.",107
4084,ESTELLE, And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.,107
4085,ESTELLE," Did he say ""Assman""?",107
4086,KRAMER," Oh, yeah.",107
4087,ESTELLE, Oh my goodness.,107
4088,KRAMER, You got that straight!,107
4089,ESTELLE, Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.,107
4090,JERRY, You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?,107
4091,GEORGE, Supposed to close with the swirl?,107
4092,JERRY," Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.",107
4093,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.",107
4094,JERRY, Yeah?,107
4095,BUZZER, Elaine.,107
4096,JERRY, C'mon up.  You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.,107
4097,JERRY," Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.",107
4098,GEORGE," What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.",107
4099,JERRY, Except that it's not Putty.,107
4100,GEORGE, What happened to Putty?,107
4101,JERRY," Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.",107
4102,GEORGE," Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. ""By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there."" ""Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on.""",107
4103,JERRY," Hey, Elaine.",107
4104,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, hello.",107
4105,JERRY, Is it something I said?,107
4106,ELAINE, Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.,107
4107,JERRY, Really?,107
4108,ELAINE," Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.",107
4109,JERRY, What is it?,107
4110,ELAINE," Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.",107
4111,JERRY, Huh.,107
4112,ELAINE," I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!",107
4113,GEORGE, Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?,107
4114,ELAINE," Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.",107
4115,GEORGE, I think that's mine.,107
4116,ELAINE, I'm not surprised.,107
4117,JERRY, Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?,107
4118,ELAINE, Why?,107
4119,JERRY, You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.,107
4120,ELAINE, An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?,107
4121,JERRY," Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. ",107
4122,ELAINE,  What? What is this?,107
4123,JERRY," That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.",107
4124,ELAINE, Fusilli Jerry?,107
4125,JERRY, Yeah. Kramer made it.,107
4126,GEORGE," All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.",107
4127,JERRY," Hey, Assman!",107
4128,KRAMER," Hey, well, this is Sally.",107
4129,SALLY, Hello.,107
4130,JERRY, Hi.,107
4131,ELAINE, Hi.,107
4132,KRAMER, Shall we go?,107
4133,SALLY, Okay. ,107
4134,ESTELLE, You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.,107
4135,FRANK, You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*.,107
4136,ESTELLE, Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.,107
4137,FRANK," I got things to do, too.",107
4138,ESTELLE, Don't upset me! I can't cry!,107
4139,FRANK," Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?",107
4140,ESTELLE," Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.",107
4141,FRANK, Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.,107
4142,ESTELLE, I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.,107
4143,FRANK, He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!,107
4144,ELAINE," Hey, let me ask you a question.",107
4145,DAVID, Sure.,107
4146,ELAINE, What do you charge for blown shocks?,107
4147,DAVID, What?,107
4148,ELAINE," Two, three hundred?",107
4149,DAVID, I don't know. Maybe five hundred.,107
4150,ELAINE, Ah.,107
4151,ELAINE, What about a bad gasket?,107
4152,DAVID, Bad gasket?,107
4153,ELAINE, Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.,107
4154,DAVID, What is all this?,107
4155,ELAINE," Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.",107
4156,DAVID, What kind of car is it?,107
4157,ELAINE, Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.,107
4158,DAVID," All together, that could run about sixteen hundred.",107
4159,ELAINE, Oh.,107
4160,ELAINE, Is that with the parts and labor?,107
4161,DAVID, Uh-huh.,107
4162,ELAINE, Hmm.,107
4163,ELAINE," Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....",107
4164,NANCY, Wow. That was...*great*. I mean...*wow*.,107

4254,GEORGE," They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.",108
4255,JERRY, Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?,108
4256,GEORGE, It better be.,108
4257,ELAINE," Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.",108
4258,PITT, One second Elaine.,108

4261,ELAINE, What?,108

4264,PITT,"  Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?",108

4266,PITT," Yes, yes, I'll check with the pharmacist.",108
4267,ELAINE," We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.",108
4268,GEORGE,"  Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?",108
4269,MORGAN, Why?,108

4271,MORGAN," I suppose we all look alike to you, right Costanza?",108
4272,GEORGE," No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...",108
4273,ELAINE, Oh my God.,108

4278,ELAINE," Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?",108
4279,MAN, Took a very dangerous combination,108
4280,ELAINE," Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.",108
4281,PITT, I spoke to someone who worked there.,108
4282,ELAINE, I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. ,108

4285,JERRY," Yes, I know. I've flown before.",108
4286,KATE, Oh good. I just didn't want you to freak out... The chance of a crash is very slim. Do you have to go to the bathroom?,108
4287,JERRY, No.,108
4288,KATE,  Because even if you have  to go a little you'd better go now because you won't get another chance until way after take off.,108
4289,KRAMER," Hey, how you doin'?",108

4294,EARL," Ah they don't know a darn thing. That's why my flight the Houston's been delayed. They're all morons. Matter of fact, I'll bet you that that flight to Pittsburgh takes off before my flight to Houston.",108
4295,KRAMER," Bet? Um, not betting.",108

4327,KATE," It didn't go very well, did it?",108
4328,JERRY," No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.",108
4329,KATE, I knew it.,108
4330,JERRY," If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.",108
4331,KATE," Why did we invite him? Stupid, stupid. when he asked for a ticket, I should have said no. I'm gonna go chew him out.",108
4332,JERRY," Oh, it doesn't matter now.",108
4333,KATE," Don't worry, Jerry. I'm on top of this.",108
4334,JERRY," Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!",108
4335,EARL," Well, Mr. Kramer, looks like you're in the hole $3200... Will that be cash or check?",108
4336,KRAMER," All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.",108

4362,JERRY, I didn't care.,108
4363,FLIGHT ATTENDANT," Well, now the pilot doesn't want you on his plane.",108
4364,JERRY, He can't just throw me off the plane!,108
4365,FLIGHT ATTENDANT," Yes he can, if he has cause to believe a passenger will be a disturbance.",108

4461,KRAMER," Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. ",108
4462,ELAINE, Kramer.,108
4463,KRAMER, Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?,108
4464,ELAINE, Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?,108
4465,EARL, What about the plane in Ithaca?,108
4466,ELAINE," Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?",108
4467,KRAMER, Boy...,108
4468,EARL, Your friend caused the delay?,108
4469,ELAINE, Uh huh.,108
4470,EARL, You're a cheat! Nobody hustles Earl Hafler.,108
4471,KRAMER, C'mon!,108
4472,EARL," See you around, Cosmo.",108
4473,KRAMER, What?,108
4474,ELAINE," Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!",108
4475,PITT," You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye.",108
4476,ELAINE, Goodbye? ,108
4477,JERRY, Bridget!,108
4478,BRIDGET," Jerry, what happened?",108
4479,JERRY," Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.",108
4480,BRIDGET," Well, my plane doesn't leave for another half hour.",108
4481,JERRY," Really?  Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!",108
4482,GEORGE," I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.",108
4483,MORGANEWMAN, Is that right?,108
4484,CARL," Yeah, I come here all the time. You wouldn't believe the rat problems in the kitchen.",108
4485,MORGANEWMAN,"  I thought so. You really are an exterminator. This time, George, you've sunk to a new low. ",108
4486,GEORGE," Check, please.",108
4487,WAITER," Hey, Sugar Ray Leonard can eat here on the house.",108
4488,GEORGE, Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!,108
4489,GEORGE," Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?",109
4490,SIENA, That's true. There really has been no development in toilet paper.,109
4491,GEORGE," And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.",109
4492,SIENA," Yeah, you're right George. What else can they do?",109
4493,GEORGE," It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.",109
4494,SIENA, Wow.,109
4495,GEORGE," You find this interesting, don't you?",109
4496,SIENA," Yes. yes, I do.",109
4497,ELAINE,"  Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.",109
4498,JERRY, What are you telling him for?,109
4499,ELAINE, What?,109
4500,JERRY," He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?",109
4501,ELAINE," Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?",109
4502,JERRY," Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, ""Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!""?",109
4503,ELAINE," Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?",109
4504,JERRY," Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.",109
4505,ELAINE," I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.",109
4506,JERRY, John Houseman?,109
4507,ELAINE," No, Alec Berg.",109
4508,ALEC,  Elaine!,109
4509,ELAINE, Hi!,109
4510,ALEC," Hi, how are you? Jerry.",109
4511,JERRY," Hi, Alec.",109
4512,ALEC, Did you hear about Gary Fogel?,109
4513,JERRY, Yeah.,109
4514,ALEC, You gonna go to the funeral on Friday?,109
4515,JERRY," Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?",109
4516,ALEC," Those are them, yeah. Season tickets. Uh, you know, unfortunately I can't go tonight, so they're available if you'd like to use them.",109
4517,JERRY," Oh, I'd love to, are you sure?",109
4518,ALEC," Absolutely, you just call my secretary, she'll arrange everything.",109
4519,JERRY, Gee thanks! Thanks a lot!,109
4520,ALEC," It's my pleasure. Be good.  You know, I actually might not use them on Friday either so I'll let you know.",109
4521,JERRY," Alright, thanks again.",109
4522,ELAINE, Thank you very much.,109
4523,JERRY," Really, thank you.",109
4524,JERRY, Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?,109
4525,ELAINE, Who?,109
4526,JERRY," These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?",109
4527,ELAINE, I will never understand people.,109
4528,JERRY, They're the worst.,109
4529,GEORGE," Something's up, there's something in the air.",109
4530,JERRY," Well, what is with you?",109
4531,GEORGE," Well, I think this is it.",109
4532,ELAINE, What's it?,109
4533,GEORGE, I saw Siena again.,109
4534,ELAINE, Siena?,109
4535,JERRY," Yeah, he's dating a crayon.",109
4536,GEORGE, We discussed toilet paper.,109
4537,JERRY, Toilet paper?,109
4538,GEORGE," Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!",109
4539,JERRY, What are you talking about?,109
4540,ELAINE, Yeah.,109
4541,JERRY, Toilet paper's changed.,109
4542,ELAINE, Yeah.,109
4543,JERRY, It's softer.,109
4544,ELAINE, Softer.,109
4545,JERRY, More sheets per roll,109
4546,ELAINE, Sheets.,109
4547,JERRY, Comes in a wide variety of colors.,109
4548,ELAINE, Colors.,109
4549,GEORGE," Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.",109
4550,JERRY, What?,109
4551,GEORGE," I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.",109
4552,JERRY," Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?",109
4553,GEORGE, Fifty-fifty.,109
4554,JERRY," Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.",109
4555,GEORGE," Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?",109
4556,ELAINE," What, you never said it?",109
4557,GEORGE," Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.",109
4558,JERRY," Well, so it wasn't a total loss.",109
4559,KRAMER, Hey.,109
4560,JERRY," Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!",109
4561,KRAMER," Oh, I'm there, Monongahela!",109
4562,JERRY," What about you, George?",109
4563,GEORGE," Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.",109
4564,KRAMER," So, so.",109
4565,GEORGE," Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.",109
4566,KRAMER," She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.",109
4567,JERRY," Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?",109
4568,ELAINE," Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.",109
4569,JERRY," Sure, fine with me.",109
4570,GEORGE," Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer.",109
4571,KRAMER, So she works at the zoo?,109
4572,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah.",109
4573,KRAMER," Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.",109
4574,ELAINE, So how long have you been a Devils' fan?,109
4575,PUDDY,"  Since I was a kid, I'm from Jersey.",109
4576,ELAINE," Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.",109
4577,PUDDY," Hey, no way, man.",109
4578,ELAINE, Yes.,109
4579,PUDDY, We're primed.,109
4580,ELAINE," Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.",109
4581,ELAINE, What the--,109
4582,PUDDY, So what do you think?,109
4583,ELAINE, What is that?,109
4584,PUDDY, I painted my face.,109
4585,ELAINE,  You painted your face?,109
4586,PUDDY, Yeah.,109
4587,ELAINE, Why?,109
4588,PUDDY," You know, support the team.",109
4589,ELAINE," Well, you can't walk around like that.",109
4590,PUDDY, Why not?,109
4591,ELAINE, Because it's insane?,109
4592,PUDDY," Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs.",109
4593,KRAMER, Hey.,109
4594,PUDDY, Hey.,109
4595,ELAINE," Dave, um, painted his face.",109
4596,KRAMER," Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.",109
4597,PUDDY," Ok, ready to go?",109
4598,KRAMER, Yeah.,109
4599,PUDDY,  LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!,109
4600,PUDDY," You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!",109
4601,PUDDY," Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team.",109
4602,ELAINE, Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!,109
4603,PUDDY," Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads.",109
4604,PUDDY, Go Devils!!,109
4605,RADIO ANNOUNCER, Devils goal! Stephan Richer scores from just inside the blue line! And the Devils take-- ,109
4606,GEORGE," You know, I could have actually gone to that.",109
4607,SIENA, So why didn't you?,109
4608,GEORGE," Well, I didn't want to break our date.",109
4609,SIENA," Oh, well.",109
4610,GEORGE, Because I... I love you.,109
4611,SIENA," You know, I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.",109
4612,PUDDY," Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate!",109
4613,KRAMER," Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over.  Watch out!",109
4614,PUDDY,"  Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man!  Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!!",109
4615,FATHER HERNANDEZ, El Diablo! Dios mio! El Diablo!!,109
4616,JERRY," ""I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.""",109
4617,GEORGE, Yup.,109
4618,JERRY, Big matzoh ball.,109
4619,GEORGE, Huge matzoh ball.,109
4620,JERRY, Those damn 'I love you' returns.,109
4621,GEORGE," Well, it's all over. I slipped up.",109
4622,JERRY," Oh, you don't know.",109
4623,GEORGE," You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, ""I love you"", and the other says, ""I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."".",109
4624,JERRY, Unless you're married.,109
4625,GEORGE," I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.",109
4626,JERRY," No, people hate that.",109
4627,GEORGE, You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.,109
4628,JERRY, Ideally.,109
4629,GEORGE, I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.,109
4630,WAITRESS, Matzoh ball soup?,109
4631,GEORGE, That'd be me.,109
4632,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry? You're a smart guy, right?",109
4633,JERRY, No question about it.,109
4634,KRAMER," Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.",109
4635,JERRY, At the zoo?,109
4636,KRAMER," Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.",109
4637,JERRY," Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?",109
4638,KRAMER," Well, he started it!",109
4639,JERRY," It's a monkey, Kramer!",109
4640,KRAMER," Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.",109
4641,JERRY," Well, I still think it's wrong.",109
4642,KRAMER," Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.",109
4643,JERRY, I'm not taking anyone's side.,109
4644,KRAMER,"  Cause I know what happened, Jerry.  Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?",109
4645,JERRY, No.,109
4646,KRAMER," Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?",109
4647,JERRY," What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?",109
4648,KRAMER," Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.",109
4649,JERRY," No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.",109
4650,KRAMER," Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.",109
4651,JERRY," Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.",109
4652,KRAMER," Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.",109
4653,JERRY," Ah, you're out of your mind.",109
4654,KRAMER," Alright, where you going?",109
4655,JERRY," I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.",109
4656,KRAMER, Who died?,109
4657,JERRY, Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?,109
4658,KRAMER, So he actually had it?,109
4659,JERRY," No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.",109
4660,ELAINE, That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.,109
4661,JERRY, The one Puddy screamed at in the car?,109
4662,ELAINE, Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.,109
4663,JERRY," Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.",109
4664,ELAINE," I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?",109
4665,JERRY, Gotta support the team.,109
4666,ELAINE, You know I really hate my clothes.,109
4667,JERRY, Hm.,109
4668,ELAINE," I open up my closet, there's just nothing.",109
4669,JERRY, Hm.,109
4670,ELAINE," Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it.  I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.",109
4671,JERRY, Hm.,109
4672,ELAINE, It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.,109
4673,JERRY,"  Hey, Alec!",109
4674,JERRY, Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?,109
4675,MR. PLESS," Ah, Mr. Kramer?",109
4676,KRAMER, Yes.,109
4677,MR. PLESS, Thanks for coming.,109
4678,KRAMER," So, uh, what did you want to see me about?",109
4679,MR. PLESS," Well, Mr. Kramer, to get right to it, we're having a bit of a problem with Barry.",109
4680,KRAMER, Barry?,109
4681,MR. PLESS, The chimpanzee.,109
4682,KRAMER," Oh. Well, uh, what's the problem?",109
4683,MR. PLESS," Well, he's not functioning the way he normally does. He seems depressed. He's lost his appetite. He's even curtailed his autoerotic activities. And we think this is directly related to the altercation he had with you the other day.",109
4684,KRAMER," So, so what do you want me to do?",109
4685,MR. PLESS," Well, frankly we'd like you to apologize.",109
4686,KRAMER," Yeah, well he started it.",109
4687,MR. PLESS," Mr. Kramer, he is an innocent primate.",109
4688,KRAMER," So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--",109
4689,SIENA," Hey, that's ok. Well, I've gotta go feed the marmosets.",109
4690,KRAMER,  You know George really likes you.,109
4691,MR. PLESS, She doesn't hear too well out of her left ear.,109
4692,KRAMER, Oh.,109
4693,JERRY," I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?",109
4694,GEORGE," Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?",109
4695,JERRY, Yeah.,109
4696,GEORGE," Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this  That's the biggest.",109
4697,JERRY," Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.",109
4698,GEORGE," Hey, they can't go, ""Hey! You look fabulous!""",109
4699,JERRY, Hey.,109
4700,KRAMER," Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.",109
4701,GEORGE," Girlfriend, yeah, right.",109
4702,KRAMER," Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.",109
4703,GEORGE, Barry?,109
4704,KRAMER, The monkey.,109
4705,JERRY, Well?,109
4706,KRAMER," Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.",109
4707,JERRY," Well, I don't think that's gonna happen.",109
4708,KRAMER," Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?",109
4709,GEORGE, What?,109
4710,KRAMER," Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?",109
4711,GEORGE, Oh my god.,109
4712,JERRY, What?,109
4713,GEORGE, She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!,109
4714,JERRY, Are you gonna say it again?,109
4715,GEORGE," That's the question, Jimmy.",109
4716,GEORGE, I'm gonna do it.,109
4717,JERRY," What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.",109
4718,GEORGE, I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!,109
4719,KRAMER, What's going on?,109
4720,JERRY, He's gonna talk into her other ear.,109
4721,KRAMER," Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?",109
4722,JERRY," Yeah, I saw him.",109
4723,KRAMER," Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?",109
4724,JERRY," Well, not exactly.",109
4725,KRAMER," He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.",109
4726,JERRY, I don't know if he's mad.,109
4727,KRAMER," Alright, so what happened when you saw him?",109
4728,JERRY," Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.",109
4729,KRAMER, Uh huh.,109
4730,JERRY," See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.",109
4731,KRAMER," See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!",109
4732,JERRY," Look, what do you want me to do?",109
4733,KRAMER, I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!,109
4734,JERRY," No. No, I can't!",109
4735,KRAMER," Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!",109
4736,JERRY," Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.",109
4737,KRAMER," You stubborn, stupid, silly man!",109
4738,PUDDY," Hey, great dip. You made this?",109
4739,ELAINE," No, it's from the store.",109
4740,PUDDY," Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.",109
4741,ELAINE," David? David, I think we aught to talk.",109
4742,PUDDY," Alright, that's cool.",109
4743,ELAINE," David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.",109
4744,PUDDY," You gotta be kidding, how come?",109
4745,ELAINE," Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.",109
4746,PUDDY," Yeah, that's right.",109
4747,ELAINE," Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.",109
4748,PUDDY," Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore.",109
4749,ELAINE," Yeah, but you like the face painting.",109
4750,PUDDY," Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything.",109
4751,ELAINE, Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?,109
4752,PUDDY," Yeah, that's right.",109
4753,ELAINE," That's so, that's so sweet.",109
4754,PUDDY," Ah, c'mere.  Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before the game. I'll be back, we'll make out.",109
4755,GEORGE," Siena, I love you.",109
4756,SIENA," Yeah, I know. I heard you the first time.",109
4757,GEORGE, Yeah. Just confirming.,109
4758,JERRY," Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.",109
4759,KRAMER," Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?",109
4760,ELAINE, What is that?,109
4761,PUDDY, That's the letter 'D'.,109
4762,ELAINE, Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?,109
4763,PUDDY," Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'.",109
4764,ELAINE, But you said no more painting.,109
4765,PUDDY," No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face.",109
4766,ELAINE," Yeah, that's right.",109
4767,KRAMER, Well? Did he call?,109
4768,JERRY, No.,109
4769,KRAMER," Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!",109
4770,JERRY," Alright!  Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?",109
4771,ALEC," What can I do for you, Jerry?",109
4772,JERRY," Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.",109
4773,ALEC," I wish you'd called me earlier, I could have given you my tickets for tonight.",109
4774,JERRY," Oh, you already gave them away?",109
4775,ALEC," Yeah, but you know what? I have a friend, he's got a couple of seats. If you don't mind the nose bleed section, they're yours.",109
4776,JERRY," No, we don't care, we just want to go.",109
4777,ALEC," There is one little catch, though.",109
4778,PUDDY," Hey, great game, huh?",109
4779,PRIEST, Father Hernandez?,109
4780,FATHER HERNANDEZ, Huh?,109
4781,PRIEST," Una senora que te vino a ver. Ella dice que tiene informacion muy importante, y que te puede ayudar. ",109
4782,FATHER HERNANDEZ, Bueno.,109
4783,PRIEST, Al fini finalmente paró el llover. ,109
4784,FATHER HERNANDEZ," Aha, bueno.",109
4785,ELAINE, Hello father.,109
4786,FATHER HERNANDEZ, Oh. La Madonna! Madre de Christo! Yo estoy lista!,109
4787,JERRY," I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I don’t know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because it’s really not a definite thing yet.  Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that I’ve received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes.  Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn’t even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, that’s what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, “You may have already won.” I’d like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, “You have definitely lost!” You turn it over, giant printing, “Not even close!” You open it up, there’s this whole letter of explanation, “Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.”",11
4788,JERRY,  To the right.,11
4789,GEORGE, That took awhile.,11
4790,JERRY, Don’t get up.,11
4791,GEORGE," I’d like to help, but my neck..",11
4792,GEORGE, So how long has it been in the basement?,11
4793,JERRY," Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didn’t want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it’s been sitting down there for three years until he saw it.  All right, so, just take what you want and let’s get it out of here.",11
4794,GEORGE, What’s in it?,11
4795,JERRY," Grandpa clothes, I can’t wear ‘em.",11
4796,KRAMER, You want these? Knee socks. You don’t wear knee socks.,11
4797,JERRY," No, go ahead. Look at this place. I can’t wait to get it cleaned.",11
4798,GEORGE, I know someone who’ll do it. She’s good. She’s honest.,11
4799,JERRY," No, Elaine’s got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and he’s suppose to do it.",11
4800,GEORGE, Students can’t clean. It’s anathema.  They don’t like it.,11
4801,JERRY, How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?,11
4802,KRAMER, Now this I like.,11
4803,GEORGE, Wait a second.  I can’t believe this! Let me see this.,11
4804,KRAMER," Wait, wait, wait...",11
4805,GEORGE, Let me just see it.,11
4806,KRAMER, Come on...,11
4807,GEORGE, Let me just see it for a second.,11
4808,GEORGE," Oh my God, it’s exactly the same!",11
4809,JERRY, What?,11
4810,GEORGE," When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, “MacArthur Park”, and I got to the part about, “I’ll never have that recipe again,” and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.",11
4811,KRAMER," C’mon, George. I saw it first.",11
4812,GEORGE," No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.",11
4813,KRAMER," No, I got dibs!",11
4814,GEORGE," What? No dibs! I need this statue. C’mon, give it!",11
4815,JERRY," Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don’t you just settle it like mature adults?",11
4816,KRAMER, Potato man!,11
4817,GEORGE," No, no, no potato man. Inka-dink.",11
4818,KRAMER, Okay...yea well uh start with me.,11
4819,GEORGE," Yeah, good, good.",11
4820,JERRY," Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.",11
4821,JERRY," Not because you’re dirty, not because you’re clean – just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...",11
4822,JERRY, And you are it!,11
4823,KRAMER," What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. He’s out. I get it.",11
4824,GEORGE," No, no, no, no, I’m It. I win.",11
4825,JERRY," No, he’s It. He wins. It is good.",11
4826,KRAMER, Do over – start with him.,11
4827,JERRY," No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.",11
4828,KRAMER," All right, you can have it. ",11
4829,GEORGE,  Dit.,11
4830,KRAMER," Okay, I’m gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.",11
4831,JERRY," All right, c’mon. Let’s go.",11
4832,KRAMER," Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.",11
4833,GEORGE, I can’t believe I won at Inka-dink.,11
4834,JERRY," Come on, let’s go.",11
4835,GEORGE, Yea.,11
4836,JERRY, Aren’t you gonna take it?,11
4837,GEORGE," No, no, no, I don’t want to carry it around all night. I’ll pick it up later.",11
4838,GEORGE,  What about your stuff?,11
4839,KRAMER," Oh, uh, well - okay.",11
4840,JERRY," All right, let’s go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.",11
4841,GEORGE, What?,11
4842,JERRY, The Inka-dink.. You were It.,11
4843,GEORGE, It’s bad?,11
4844,JERRY, It’s very bad.,11
4845,RAVA," Well, if they don’t let you be my editor on this book, I’ll go to another publisher. It’s that simple.",11
4846,ELAINE, You told them that?,11
4847,RAVA, Of course.,11
4848,ELAINE,  This is so fantastic. I don’t know how to thank you.,11
4849,JERRY,"  So, where’s this boyfriend of yours? I can’t wait much longer. I’ve got a flight.",11
4850,ELAINE," Oh, probably caught in traffic.",11
4851,RAVA, Or maybe he’s dead.,11
4852,JERRY," So what do you write, children’s books?",11
4853,RAVA, That’s Ray.,11
4854,RAY," Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you.",11
4855,JERRY, All right...,11
4856,RAVA, And we have to get back to work.,11
4857,JERRY, I gotta get to the airport.,11
4858,RAY," Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.",11
4859,JERRY, The uh toilet brush is under the sink.,11
4860,JERRY," I don’t really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there’s that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, you’re sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, “I’m really sorry about this. I don’t know why I left that stuff over there.” And that’s why I could never be a maid, because I’d have an attitude. I’d find them, wherever they are in the house, “Oh, I suppose you couldn’t do this? No, don’t get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldn’t dust. No, this is too tough, isn’t it?”",11
4861,JERRY," He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid!  He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this.  He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!",11
4862,ELAINE, There’s no Rubber Man.,11
4863,JERRY, Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There’s Elastic Man... Plastic Man...,11
4864,ELAINE, I’m leaving.,11
4865,JERRY, Where are you going?,11
4866,ELAINE, To Rava’s house. I’ve gotta pick up her manuscript.,11
4867,JERRY, Oh wait. I’ll go with you.,11
4868,JERRY," Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole!",11
4869,ELAINE,"  So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He’s the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-",11
4870,RAVA, Demand.,11
4871,ELAINE, They're going to promote me to editor.,11
4872,RAVA, Daantotin.  There’s Ray... late as usual.,11
4873,RAY," Well, this is an unexpected surprise – and delight! The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the First, gracing our humble abode. Rava, we’re in the presence of royalty.",11
4874,JERRY," Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.",11
4875,RAY," But I didn’t just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.",11
4876,JERRY, Shouldn’t you be out on a ledge somewhere?,11
4877,RAVA, The water is boiling. Are you having tea?,11
4878,ELAINE, Jerry? Jerry!,11
4879,JERRY, What?,11
4880,RAVA,"  Ray, would you give me a hand?",11
4881,RAY," Yeah, I’m coming!",11
4882,JERRY, I think that’s the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!,11
4883,ELAINE, What statue?,11
4884,JERRY, I had a statue!,11
4885,ELAINE, You have a statue? I never saw a statue.,11
4886,JERRY, My grandfather gave me a statue!,11
4887,ELAINE, Since when?,11
4888,JERRY, What’s the difference?! That’s the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!,11
4889,RAY, Do you take sugar?,11
4890,JERRY, I can’t believe it! This guy ripped me off!,11
4891,ELAINE, Do you realize what you’re saying?,11
4892,JERRY, Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!,11
4893,RAY, Lemon?,11
4894,ELAINE, Are you sure?,11
4895,JERRY, Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.,11
4896,ELAINE, Ninety-nine percent sure?!,11
4897,RAY," Ah, sweet elixir. It’s fragrant nectar a soothing balm for the soul.",11
4898,RAVA," Ah those are the pastries, Ray take care of that, I'm going to get Elaine the manuscript.",11
4899,RAY," Ah, the pastries!",11
4900,ELAINE, Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it’s just a coincidence.,11
4901,JERRY," Coincidence? This guy’s in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment?",11
4902,ELAINE, I never saw the statue.,11
4903,JERRY, I had a statue! What should I do?,11
4904,ELAINE, I don’t know.,11
4905,JERRY, I’ll call Kramer. He can check my house.,11
4906,ELAINE," Oh Jerry, don’t blow this for me.",11
4907,JERRY," Don’t worry.  Kramer! Kramer!... It’s Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!...",11
4908,JERRY," Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye.  My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are.",11
4909,RAVA, My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. We never heard from her again. I hope she’s rotting in an alley somewhere!,11
4910,JERRY, My mom’s down in Florida. She’s got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?,11
4911,RAY," I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.",11
4912,JERRY," Listen, uh I just remembered... I’m... uh, getting a facial.",11
4913,ELAINE," Oh, see you tomorrow morning.",11
4914,RAY, How about dinner?,11
4915,JERRY," No, I don’t eat dinner. Dinner’s for suckers.",11
4916,JERRY," Uh huh... Yeah... Okay, thanks anyway... Bye.",11
4917,JERRY," Nope, the cop says it’s my word against his. There’s nothing they can do.",11
4918,KRAMER, Let’s go get him.,11
4919,JERRY," Yeah, right.",11
4920,GEORGE, We can’t just let him get away with this.,11
4921,JERRY," Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know it’s missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He’s crazy.",11
4922,KRAMER, You wanna go get him?,11
4923,ELAINE," Well, then, if he’s crazy you should just forget it.",11
4924,GEORGE, Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mother’s making her roasted potatoes!,11
4925,ELAINE," George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?",11
4926,GEORGE, Who is this Rava?,11
4927,KRAMER, I say we get him.,11
4928,ELAINE, No!,11
4929,GEORGE, Let me just call him.,11
4930,JERRY," I’ll call him.  Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Rava’s friend, Elaine’s friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady?  Would you shut up?!  Yeah, you don’t want to talk about it over the phone?.. You don’t want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monk’s?... All right, tomorrow... One o’ clock... Great, okay, bye.",11
4931,ELAINE," All right, look, look, look. Let’s say he stole it.",11
4932,GEORGE," Oh, he stole it!",11
4933,ELAINE," C’mon, you can’t do anything about it. The cops won’t do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why don’t you just forget it?",11
4934,GEORGE, I thought you said one o’clock.,11
4935,JERRY," Relax, he’s late. He’s always late. It’s part of his M.O.",11
4936,GEORGE," Remember, don’t take any crap.",11
4937,JERRY," Yeah, yeah. Don’t worry about it.",11
4938,GEORGE, I’ll be right here.,11
4939,JERRY, That’s comforting. Shh. He’s coming.  Ray?,11
4940,RAY," Oh, Jerry. I can’t believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could’ve got me into?",11
4941,JERRY," Well, I didn’t...",11
4942,RAY, Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.,11
4943,GEORGE,  I wonder why.,11
4944,JERRY," Well, just give it back, and I won’t say anything.",11
4945,RAY, Give it back?,11
4946,JERRY, Yeah.,11
4947,RAY, What are you talking about?,11
4948,JERRY, What are you talking about?,11
4949,GEORGE, What is he talking about?,11
4950,RAY, I’m talking about the statue.,11
4951,JERRY," Yeah, me too.",11
4952,RAY, Give it back to whom?,11
4953,JERRY, Me.,11
4954,GEORGE," Yeah, him.",11
4955,RAY, You?,11
4956,JERRY, Yeah. Me.,11
4957,RAY, I’m not getting this.,11
4958,GEORGE, You already got it.,11
4959,JERRY," Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house – and then I saw it in your house.",11
4960,RAY, What are you saying?,11
4961,JERRY, What am I saying?,11
4962,GEORGE, Take a wild guess.,11
4963,RAY, Are you saying I stole your statue?,11
4964,GEORGE, What a mind.,11
4965,JERRY," Well, I...",11
4966,RAY, I can’t believe what I’m hearing.,11
4967,JERRY, I can’t believe what I’m hearing.,11
4968,GEORGE, I can’t believe what I’m hearing.,11
4969,RAY," For your information, I got that statue in a pawn shop.",11
4970,GEORGE, Pawn shop?,11
4971,JERRY, A pawn shop?,11
4972,RAY, Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning people’s apartments.,11
4973,GEORGE, Cleaning them out.,11
4974,JERRY," Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.",11
4975,RAY," What’s behind this? It’s Rava, isn’t it?",11
4976,GEORGE, Again with the Rava.,11
4977,RAY, You want her.,11
4978,JERRY," No, she’s a little too cheery for me.",11
4979,RAY," She’s from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!",11
4980,JERRY, I know Finland. They’re neutral.,11
4981,RAY, Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?,11
4982,JERRY," No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...",11
4983,GEORGE," “Oh, I find you so charming.” You wuss.",11
4984,JERRY,  Did you call me a wuss?,11
4985,RAY, What did you say?,11
4986,JERRY, I said luss. I’m at a luss.,11
4987,RAY, I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.,11
4988,JERRY," That’s not necessary.  You know, maybe it’s not that bad an idea.",11
4989,RAY," And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.",11
4990,GEORGE, Singapore?! Do you hear this?,11
4991,RAY," If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore and have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.",11
4992,GEORGE, That’s it! That’s it! I can’t take it. I can’t take it anymore! You stole the statue! You’re a theif! You’re a liar!,11
4993,JERRY, George...,11
4994,RAY, Who is this?,11
4995,GEORGE," I’m the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty!",11
4996,RAY, What’s going on here?,11
4997,GEORGE, GUILTY!,11
4998,RAY, Your friend is crazy.,11
4999,GEORGE," Oh, I’m crazy!",11
5000,JERRY," George, george...",11
5001,RAY, I’ve got to get going. I have a class.,11
5002,GEORGE," Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrar’s office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!",11
5003,RAY," Well, that’s because I’m registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.",11
5004,GEORGE, You mean alias.,11
5005,RAY, You are starting to make me angry!,11
5006,GEORGE," Well, that was bound to happen.",11
5007,RAY,"  I hope you think about what you’ve done here today. And if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me.",11
5008,JERRY," Hey, Ray.",11
5009,RAY, Yes?,11
5010,JERRY, How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!,11
5011,ELAINE, Nervous?,11
5012,RAVA, Why should I be?,11
5013,ELAINE, Yeah. Right.,11
5014,RAVA, Your notes are very insightful.,11
5015,ELAINE, The book is great. Did you go out last night?,11
5016,RAVA, No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.,11
5017,ELAINE, They all are.,11
5018,RAVA, Was Jerry?,11
5019,ELAINE, I can’t remember.,11
5020,RAVA," You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations.",11
5021,ELAINE," Oh, well, I’m staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.",11
5022,RAVA, So you think he stole it?!,11
5023,ELAINE," Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence...",11
5024,RAVA, I admit nothing!,11
5025,MAN," Will you put that cigarette out, please?",11
5026,ELAINE," Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it’s gone and it’s in your apartment.",11
5027,RAVA, Maybe you think we’re in cahoots.,11
5028,ELAINE," No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.",11
5029,RAVA," Yes, that’s all",11
5030,ELAINE, A big coincidence.,11
5031,RAVA, Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!,11
5032,ELAINE," No, that’s a big coincidence.",11
5033,RAVA, That’s what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences!,11
5034,ELAINE," No, there are degrees of coincidences.",11
5035,RAVA," No, there are only coincidences! Ask anyone!",11
5036,RAVA," Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? Well?! Well?!",11
5037,MAN, Will you put that cigarette out?!,11
5038,RAVA, Maybe I put it out on your face!  It’s just like Ray said. You and Jerry are jealous of our love. You’re trying to destroy us.,11
5039,ELAINE, Shouldn’t you be out on a ledge somewhere?,11
5040,GEORGE," Ma, will you stop?... It’s just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didn’t even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I don’t see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye.  She doesn’t react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.",11
5041,KRAMER, I’m not happy about this.,11
5042,ELAINE, Why don’t we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?,11
5043,GEORGE," There’s just no justice. This experience has changed me. It’s made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.",11
5044,JERRY, Really?,11
5045,GEORGE,"  Sure, why not.",11
5046,ELAINE," Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.",11
5047,JERRY, Can’t you talk to your boss?,11
5048,ELAINE," I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think you’re funny at all.",11
5049,KRAMER,  I’m not happy about this.,11
5050,JERRY," Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..",11
5051,GEORGE," Yeah, he’ll have my parents.",11
5052,KRAMER,  Police! Open up!,11
5053,RAY, Police?,11
5054,KRAMER," Freeze, mother!",11
5055,RAY, Hey.,11
5056,KRAMER," Shut up. Spread ‘em. I said spread ‘em!  You’re in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder.",11
5057,RAY, Murder?!,11
5058,KRAMER," Shut up! Keep ‘em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!",11
5059,RAY, I think you have me confused with somebody else.,11
5060,KRAMER, Is your name Ray?,11
5061,RAY, Yeah.,11
5062,KRAMER," Yeah, you’re the punk I’m looking for!",11
5063,RAY," Hey, hey, are you a cop?",11
5064,KRAMER," Yeah, I’m a cop. I’m a good cop. I’m a damn good cop!  Today’s your lucky day, junior, ‘cause I’m gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and you’ll be sorry. You got me?",11
5065,RAY, Got you? I don’t even know what the hell you’re talking about.,11
5066,KRAMER," Good, good. Let’s uh keep it that way.",11
5067,JERRY," All right, all right. What’s the big hubbub, bub?",11
5068,GEORGE," Kramer, I can’t believe it. Oh, you’re my hero!",11
5069,KRAMER, Yeah.,11
5070,JERRY," Kramer, what did you do?",11
5071,KRAMER," Well, let’s just say I didn’t take him to People’s Court.",11
5072,GEORGE," I feel like a huge weight’s been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I don’t know how to thank you!",11
5073,KRAMER," Well, I’ll think of something.",11
5074,JERRY," People are going to steal from you. You can’t stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, who’s gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They can’t get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.",11
5075,GENNICE,  ,110
5076,JERRY,"  Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's ""Beaches"" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.",110
5077,JERRY," She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was ""Beaches"" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?",110
5078,GEORGE, Where were you?,110
5079,JERRY, I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.,110
5080,GEORGE," Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.",110
5081,JERRY, Of course.,110
5082,GEORGE," When you're talking about a movie like ""Beaches"", moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage.",110
5083,JERRY," yeah,",110
5084,KRAMER, Hey.,110
5085,GEORGE, Hey. I gotta go.,110
5086,KRAMER, Where you going?,110
5087,JERRY," The Improv is playing ""Rochelle Rochelle"" The musical.",110
5088,KRAMER, Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?,110
5089,JERRY, She might be. She's the star of the show.,110
5090,KRAMER," Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.",110
5091,GEORGE, I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.,110
5092,KRAMER," So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe.",110
5093,GEORGE, Gennice palying today?,110
5094,JERRY," Yeah, maybe.",110
5095,KRAMER, Who's Gennice?,110
5096,JERRY, That's the understudy. I'm dating her.,110
5097,KRAMER," Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?",110
5098,JERRY, Yeah.,110
5099,KRAMER," Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world.",110
5100,JERRY, I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.,110
5101,GEORGE, Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.,110
5102,JERRY, Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thing…real bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.,110
5103,RUBY, You late.,110
5104,ELAINE, I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus,110
5105,RUBY," ""That's a shame"". You'll have to wait for Lotus now.",110
5106,ELAINE, How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.,110
5107,RUBY," ""Mustn't keep the princess waiting. Princess in a big hurry."" ""No change for bus"" ""Poor princess.""",110
5108,ELAINE," What?, uh?",110
5109,RUBY," Nothing, won't be long.",110
5110,LOTUS," ""Princess wants a manicure.""",110
5111,SUNNY," ""Oh lucky me.""",110
5112,LOTUS," ""Oh, you got the princess.""",110
5113,ELAINE, What is so funny?,110
5114,RUBY, …tell knock-knock joke.,110
5115,ELAINE, The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.,110
5116,JERRY, How would you know? You don't speak Korean.,110
5117,ELAINE, Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at me…ge ge ge,110
5118,KRAMER," You know, maybe in Korean ""dog"" isn't an insult. Could be like the word ""fox"" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!",110
5119,JERRY, Why don't you go to another nail shop?,110
5120,ELAINE," Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.",110
5121,JERRY, What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.,110
5122,ELAINE," Yeah, who speaks Korean?",110
5123,JERRY, You know who speaks Korean?,110
5124,ELAINE," No, who?",110
5125,JERRY, George's father.,110
5126,ELAINE, You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?,110
5127,JERRY, He used to go there a lot on business.,110
5128,ELAINE, What did he do?,110
5129,JERRY," He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.",110
5130,ELAINE," Uh,",110
5131,JERRY," George, does your father speak Korean?",110
5132,GEORGE," Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.",110
5133,JERRY," Oh, hi Gennice.",110
5134,GENNICE, Hi Jerry.,110
5135,JERRY," This is George, this is Kramer.",110
5136,GENNICE, Nice to meet you.,110
5137,JERRY, Playing today?,110
5138,GENNICE, No. I'm on the bench today.,110
5139,JERRY, They really stick to that understudy rule.,110
5140,KRAMER, So she's coming?,110
5141,GENNICE," Oh, yeah, she'll be here. . . . Oh no, my frankfurter, my frankfurter fell  . It was really good. I can't believe that I dropped it. ",110
5142,JERRY," It's okay…it's just a hot dog,  everything is going to be okay.",110
5143,GENNICE, No it  was really good.,110
5144,KRAMER," Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi.",110
5145,BETTE, Hi.,110
5146,KRAMER," Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful.",110
5147,BETTE," Uh, thank you.",110
5148,KRAMER," Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done.",110
5149,BETTE, Really?,110
5150,KRAMER, Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.,110
5151,BETTE, What flavours do they have?,110
5152,KRAMER," Chocolate, Lemon, and uh, Cherry.",110
5153,BETTE, How about Pineapple?,110
5154,KRAMER," Pineapple, sure, alright, I'll be right back.",110
5155,KRAMER," Oh, uh, uh. ",110
5156,ELAINE," Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?",110
5157,FRANK, I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy.,110
5158,ELAINE," uh, ha.",110
5159,FRANK, Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.,110
5160,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want.",110
5161,FRANK," No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think I've got a foot odour problem.",110
5162,GEORGE," I watched ""Beaches"" on cable last night. … … Give me a break.",110
5163,BETTE, Get some talent then you can mouth off.,110
5164,UMPIRE, Strike three.,110
5165,BETTE, What? Are you blind?,110
5166,UMPIRE, What?,110
5167,BETTE," Nothing, nothing.",110
5168,FRANK, I had an affair with a Korean woman.,110
5169,ELAINE," Uh, Mr. Costanza, I …",110
5170,FRANK," No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me.",110
5171,ELAINE," Mr. Costanza, I, …",110
5172,FRANK," Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, "" eno enoa juang "". Which means, ""this guy - this is not my kind of guy"".",110
5173,BETTE, Move it in. Move in everybody. Get your shrimp here. Shrimp on special today!,110
5174,JERRY," Come on George, just loosen up.",110
5175,JERRY, Come on George.,110
5176,KRAMER, I GOT THE PINEAPPLE. ,110
5177,JERRY,  Keep going.,110
5178,GEORGE, Aaaaaah,110
5179,UMPIRE, SAFE!,110
5180,GEORGE, come on it's just a game.,110
5181,KRAMER,"  Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time  ""You are the wind…""",110
5182,TV, the show will go on but not Bette Midler. While playing softball in the park Ms. Midler was injured when another player thoughtlessly rammed her at home plate. All captured on amateur video tape. She will be out for two weeks from her Broadway show; Rochelle Rochelle - The Musical.,110
5183,GENNICE, . . . Thank you. ,110
5184,JERRY, Well we…,110
5185,GENNICE," No, please. This is the first time in my life  that anyone has ever done anything like this for me. I've always had to struggle so hard for everything I ever got.  and I know this is going to be my big break. ",110
5186,JERRY,  It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.,110
5187,KRAMER," Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!",110
5188,JERRY, Come back another time.,110
5189,KRAMER, SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.,110
5190,KRAMER," So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... ",110
5191,ELAINE," Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.",110
5192,RUBY," What would you like today? Manicure, Pedicure?",110
5193,FRANK, I'll take a manicure. I don't take my shoes off for anyone.,110
5194,RUBY," ""That's the least of his problems.""",110
5195,FRANK, What was that?,110
5196,ELAINE, What'd they say? What'd they say?,110
5197,FRANK, They made a derogatory comment about me.,110
5198,RUBY," ""She's with a man twice her age."" ""He doesn't look like he's got much money either.""",110
5199,LOTUS," ""Check out that sweater"". ",110
5200,RUBY," ""I think I saw a moth fly out of a pocket.""",110
5201,LOTUS," ""What happened to his tail?""",110
5202,FRANK," Okay, THAT'S IT! ""oki on awa"" Where's my tail? I heard every word you said. You got some nerve.",110
5203,KIM, That voice? It sounds so familiar. It reminds me of when I was ayoung girl in Korea and I met an American businessman. He was a very unusual man. Quick temperd with a strange halting way of speaking. We fell in love but when I brought him home to meet my father? He refused to take his shoes off. And there was a terrible fight.,110
5204,LOTUS, That man also refuses to take his shoes off.,110
5205,FRANK,  I never seen people treated like this!,110
5206,RUBY, You brought in a spy! . . . Get Out!,110
5207,KIM, Frank?,110
5208,FRANK, Kim?,110
5209,KRAMER,"  A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw, … you want whit e meat or dark?",110
5210,BETTE, White meat.,110
5211,KRAMER," Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. It's your ass buster.",110
5212,BETTE, Get me one of those Black and White cookies.,110
5213,KRAMER," yeah, all right, yeah….  They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.",110
5214,BETTE, Good. Because if I don't get a Black and White cookie I'm not going to be very pleasant to be around.,110
5215,KRAMER, Now that's impossible.,110
5216,ELAINE,   … I don't even know where I'm going.,110
5217,PETERMAN, That's the best way to get someplace you've never been.,110
5218,ELAINE," yes,  I suppose, …",110
5219,PETERMAN, Have you been crying?,110
5220,ELAINE," Yes,  you see this  woman, this manicurist,…",110
5221,PETERMAN," Oh no, that doesn’t matter now. That's a very nice jacket.",110
5222,ELAINE," Uh,  thanks.",110
5223,PETERMAN," Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola.",110
5224,ELAINE, How do you know all that?,110
5225,PETERMAN, That's my coat.,110
5226,ELAINE, You mean..?,110
5227,PETERMAN," Yes, I'm J. Peterman.",110
5228,ELAINE, Oh!,110
5229,JERRY," I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.",110
5230,GENNICE," Hey, I didn't do anything. I was never informed. … YOU CAN ALL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL…. You see that? You see what I am going through?",110
5231,GEORGE, So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.,110
5232,JERRY," Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.",110
5233,GENNICE, I'm having a little trouble with all this. I mean all I ever wanted to do is sing. Now I'm the focus of this big media frenzy.  Nobody in the show will even talk to me.,110
5234,JERRY, Stop your crying will ya?,110
5235,GENNICE, What?,110
5236,GEORGE, You heard him.,110
5237,GENNICE," Oh, don't you you're the reason this whole thing happened.",110
5238,GEORGE," Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?",110
5239,CABBIE, Wait. Wait. I know you. You knocked Bette Midler out of Rochelle Rochelle the Musical. I want you creeps out of my cab.,110
5240,JERRY," Hey, I had nothing to do with it.",110
5241,CABBIE," Get out of my cab. You should go to prison. You should be in prison for the rest of your life. Get out, each of you. Each and every one of you get out of my cab.",110
5242,PETERMAN, Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00.,110
5243,ELAINE," Oh, that's not too expensive.",110
5244,PETERMAN, That shirt. Where did you get it?,110
5245,ELAINE," Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.",110
5246,PETERMAN, That's NOT bad!,110
5247,KIM," Oh, Frank. So many years. If only you had taken your shoes off.",110
5248,FRANK, I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem.,110
5249,KIM, I thought maybe you had a hole in your socks.,110
5250,FRANK, I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your father had to make a federal case out of it.,110
5251,KIM, Anyway that is all in the past. We have our whole future ahead of us.,110
5252,FRANK, Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal.,110
5253,KIM, You short stop me? We don't do that in Korea! Take me home. Inever want to see you again.,110
5254,KRAMER," Hi, here. I made this for your. ",110
5255,BETTE, … What is it?,110
5256,KRAMER, It's macaroni Midler.,110
5257,BETTE, Macaroni Midler?,110
5258,KRAMER," Yeah, see how you're singing?",110
5259,BETTE, … yeah …ha ha. Well you made a long journey from Milan to Minsk.,110
5260,KRAMER," oh, what's that from?",110
5261,BETTE," Oh, that's one of the songs from my show. Bette sings",110
5262,KRAMER, Oh You are so freaking talented.,110
5263,KRAMER," Oh, so look who's here. What do you want.",110
5264,JERRY, We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.,110
5265,KRAMER," No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question.",110
5266,JERRY, What?,110
5267,KRAMER, Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.,110
5268,GEORGE, Who are you to decide?,110
5269,KRAMER, I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS!,110
5270,GEORGE," Hey, look, Kramer,…",110
5271,KRAMER, AH! I don't want her disturbed.,110
5272,RUBY," hello, Elaine.",110
5273,ELAINE, Hello,110
5274,LOTUS, We're so excited.,110
5275,ELAINE, You're welcome.,110
5276,RUBY, We'll see you inside.,110
5277,JERRY, What happened?,110
5278,ELAINE," Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.",110
5279,JERRY," Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.",110
5280,ELAINE," Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job.",110
5281,JERRY, Where?,110
5282,ELAINE, Writing for the J. Peterman catalogue.,110
5283,JERRY,  How did you get that?,110
5284,ELAINE, I met him.,110
5285,JERRY, You met J. Peterman?,110

5592,ELAINE," I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.",111
5593,JERRY, Very strange.,111
5594,ELAINE, I know.,111
5595,JERRY," So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?",111
5596,ELAINE," Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.",111
5597,JERRY, All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.,111
5598,ELAINE, News? What news?,111
5599,JERRY, Sorry!,111
5600,ELAINE, What? What?,111
5601,JERRY," All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.",111
5602,ELAINE," Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!",111
5603,JERRY, George Costanza...,111
5604,ELAINE, Yeah?,111
5605,JERRY, Is getting married!,111
5606,ELAINE, Get out!,111
5607,KRAMER, Hi.,111
5608,COP, You Cosmo Kramer?,111
5609,KRAMER," Uh, yes. Yeah.",111
5610,COP, You recognize this piece of fabric?,111
5611,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, that's...",111
5612,COP, What?,111
5613,KRAMER, What?,111
5614,COP, You're under arrest.,111
5615,KRAMER, Arrest?,111
5616,COP, I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature. Including a report with some damage to the rear seat. It seems the spring was so compressed it completely collapsed the right side..,111
5617,JERRY, Newman.,111
5618,NEWMAN, What took you so long?,111
5619,KRAMER," Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?",111
5620,NEWMAN," Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.",111
5621,ELAINE, I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?,111
5622,ELAINE," Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.",112
5623,JERRY, Really? What happened?,112
5624,ELAINE," Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.",112
5625,JERRY, Isn't he the one with the show on cable?,112
5626,ELAINE," Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.",112
5627,JERRY, That's great.,112
5628,ELAINE, I know.,112
5629,JERRY, That looks pretty good.,112
5630,ELAINE, He's in.,112
5631,JERRY," Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.",112
5632,ELAINE, What's to discuss?,112
5633,JERRY, Come on! GEORGE,112
5634,ELAINE, Is he happy?,112
5635,GEORGE, I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?,112
5636,SUSAN," Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.",112
5637,GEORGE, Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?,112
5638,SUSAN," Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.",112
5639,GEORGE, A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.,112
5640,SUSAN," Can we change the subject, please?",112
5641,GEORGE, Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?,112
5642,SUSAN," No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.",112
5643,GEORGE, It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.,112
5644,SUSAN," Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.",112
5645,GEORGE,  How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.,112
5646,JERRY," Yeah, he seems pretty happy.",112
5647,ELAINE," Well, that's all that counts, I guess.",112
5648,JERRY, What's the matter?,112
5649,ELAINE," Oh, nothin'.",112
5650,JERRY," Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.",112
5651,ELAINE," Well, what do you want me to do?",112
5652,JERRY," Well, at least have some reaction to it.",112
5653,ELAINE," …Well, I don't.",112
5654,JERRY, Maybe you're a little jealous.,112
5655,ELAINE," Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?",112
5656,JERRY," No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.",112
5657,ELAINE," Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.",112
5658,JERRY," Oh, yeah. Right.",112
5659,ELAINE," Yeah, right.",112
5660,JERRY, Lainy!,112
5661,ELAINE, Jerry!,112
5662,JERRY, You don't wanna get married?,112
5663,ELAINE," Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.",112
5664,JERRY," Oh, come on!",112
5665,ELAINE," Oh, you come on.",112
5666,JERRY, You're such...,112
5667,KRAMER," Oh, hey!",112
5668,JERRY, Hey.,112
5669,KRAMER," Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?",112
5670,ELAINE," Oh, dear.",112
5671,KRAMER," It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?",112
5672,JERRY, We're gonna change the system.,112
5673,KRAMER, Yes!,112
5674,ELAINE," Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.",112
5675,ELAINE," Oh, hello, Rabbi Krischma.",112
5676,RABBI, ELAINE,112
5677,ELAINE, Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.,112
5678,RABBI," Elaine, often times in life there are problems, and just as often there are solutions.",112
5679,ELAINE," Yeah, I suppose.",112
5680,RABBI," Elaine, you don't seem yourself today. You seem, if I may say, troubled.",112
5681,ELAINE," No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.",112
5682,RABBI, Come upstairs. We'll have a talk.,112
5683,JERRY, Hey!,112
5684,GEORGE, I want your honest opinion about something.,112
5685,JERRY, Have I ever been less than forthright?,112
5686,GEORGE," No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.",112
5687,JERRY," Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?",112
5688,GEORGE," All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea",112
5689,JERRY, Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.,112
5690,GEORGE," It's good, right?",112
5691,JERRY, I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.,112
5692,GEORGE, You do?,112
5693,JERRY," Yes, I do.",112
5694,GEORGE," Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.",112
5695,JERRY, Hmm.,112
5696,GEORGE," Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, ""Can we change the subject?""",112
5697,JERRY," See, now that I don't care for.",112
5698,GEORGE," Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?",112
5699,JERRY, It should resolve of its own volition.,112
5700,GEORGE," That's exactly what I said, except I used the word ""momentum"".",112
5701,JERRY, Momentum - same thing.,112
5702,GEORGE," Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?",112
5703,JERRY," Yeah, I know.",112
5704,GEORGE," Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.",112
5705,JERRY, You're turning.,112
5706,GEORGE," Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.",112
5707,JERRY," If you need more time, you should have more time.",112
5708,GEORGE," What, you think I could postpone it?",112
5709,JERRY, Sure you can. Why not?,112
5710,GEORGE, That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?,112
5711,JERRY, I don't see why not.,112
5712,GEORGE," So, I could do that?",112
5713,JERRY," Sure, go ahead.",112
5714,GEORGE," All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.",112
5715,JERRY, Spring. Of course.,112
5716,GEORGE, Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.,112
5717,JERRY, Beautiful.,112
5718,GEORGE, She's not gonna like it.,112
5719,JERRY," No, she's not.",112
5720,GEORGE," You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.",112
5721,JERRY," Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.",112
5722,GEORGE," Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.",112
5723,JERRY," Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.",112
5724,KRAMER," Hey, hey.",112
5725,GEORGE," March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?",112
5726,JERRY," Oh, all the way.",112
5727,GEORGE, You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.,112
5728,JERRY, Is that so?,112
5729,JERRY," Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?",112
5730,KRAMER, Definitely.,112
5731,JERRY, You're kidding?,112
5732,KRAMER," No, no, I would turn you in.",112
5733,JERRY, You would turn me in?,112
5734,KRAMER," Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it.",112
5735,JERRY, I can't believe your a friend of mine.,112
5736,KRAMER, What kind of person are you going around killing people?,112
5737,JERRY," Well, I am sure I had a good reason.",112
5738,KRAMER," Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?",112
5739,JERRY, But you know me!,112
5740,KRAMER, I thought I DID!,112
5741,ELAINE, I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.,112
5742,RABBI, Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories,112
5743,ELAINE," Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .",112
5744,RABBI, How wonderful.,112
5745,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.",112
5746,RABBI, Doesn't it give you any joy to see your friend enter into this holiest of unions?,112
5747,ELAINE," No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.",112
5748,RABBI," You know, Elaine, very often we cannot see the forest for the trees.",112
5749,ELAINE," Yeah, I don't know what that means.",112
5750,RABBI," Well, for example, say there's a forest, . . .",112
5751,ELAINE," You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.",112
5752,RABBI, You know my temple has many single functions.,112
5753,ELAINE," No, no, it's okay.",112
5754,RABBI, My nephew Alex is someone who is also looking perhaps …,112
5755,ELAINE, I don't think so.,112
5756,RABBI, He owns a flower store. Very successful.,112
5757,JERRY, So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.,112
5758,KRAMER," Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.",112
5759,JERRY, Another Café Latte?,112
5760,KRAMER, You better believe it.,112
5761,KRAMER, Since when are you so trendy?,112
5762,JERRY," Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Café Latte?",112
5763,JERRY, I don't recall you drinking Café Latte.,112
5764,KRAMER, I've been drinking Café Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.,112
5765,JERRY," Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.",112
5766,KRAMER, I've always wanted to see this.,112
5767,JERRY, You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.,112
5768,KRAMER," Well, yeah, lets do it uh?",112
5769,JERRY," Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.",112
5770,JERRY, Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.,112
5771,KRAMER, Maybe I will.,112
5772,GEORGE," Hi,",112
5773,SUSAN, How was your day?,112
5774,GEORGE," Good, good day. How was your day?",112
5775,SUSAN, Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?,112
5776,GEORGE," Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.",112
5777,SUSAN," Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.",112
5778,GEORGE," The Lowers, really?",112
5779,SUSAN, You don't want to go?,112
5780,GEORGE," No, I want to go.",112
5781,SUSAN, So what did Jerry have to say?,112
5782,GEORGE," Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!",112
5783,SUSAN," Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.",112
5784,GEORGE," Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?",112
5785,SUSAN, Yeah.,112
5786,GEORGE," Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.",112
5787,SUSAN, What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?,112
5788,GEORGE," No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the …",112
5789,SUSAN," If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so.  Say so.",112
5790,GEORGE," Still marry , still marry.",112
5791,SUSAN, You don't love me.,112
5792,GEORGE, Sstill love. Still love.,112
5793,SUSAN, My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.,112
5794,GEORGE," No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I …It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.",112
5795,SUSAN, Are you sure?,112
5796,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.",112
5797,JERRY, Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.,112
5798,GEORGE, How did you know that?,112
5799,JERRY, I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.,112
5800,GEORGE, I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.,112
5801,JERRY," tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.",112
5802,GEORGE, You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.,112
5803,JERRY," Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.",112
5804,GEORGE, I didn't have any sex.,112
5805,JERRY, You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.,112
5806,GEORGE, I didn't have make-up sex.,112
5807,JERRY, In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.,112
5808,GEORGE," Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!",112
5809,WOMAN, ,112
5810,MAN, I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin',112
5811,GEORGE, Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.,112
5812,MAN, Are you going to eat thoise fries?,112
5813,GEORGE, This is amazing.  Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better ,112
5814,JERRY, . . . Poor bastard.,112
5815,JERRY," Good evening, Rabbi.",112
5816,RABBI, Good evening. And how does this evening find you?,112
5817,JERRY," Well, Rabbi, well.",112

5819,JERRY," Yeah, that's right.",112
5820,RABBI, I hope she's feeling better.,112
5821,JERRY, What do you mean?,112
5822,RABBI, She didn't tell you?,112
5823,JERRY, No.,112
5824,RABBI, Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her feeling bitter and hostile.,112
5825,JERRY, is that so?,112
5826,RABBI," Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married.",112
5827,JERRY, Really?,112
5828,RABBI, She came off as pretty desperate.,112
5829,JERRY, I didn't know any of this.,112
5830,RABBI, Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation.,112
5831,JERRY," Hum, well it all comes as news to me.",112
5832,GEORGE,  Hi.,112
5833,SUSAN," Hi, how was your day?",112
5834,GEORGE," Good, good day. How was your day?",112
5835,SUSAN," Ah, it was okay. What's going on?",112
5836,GEORGE," Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?",112
5837,SUSAN," Yeah, sure.",112
5838,GEORGE," You see this is the thing. . . .  I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, ",112
5839,SUSAN," George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.",112
5840,GEORGE, Yeah?,112
5841,SUSAN," Oh, don't worry your head. Of course.",112
5842,GEORGE, All right. ,112
5843,ELAINE, I've got that magazine article for you.,112
5844,JERRY, You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.,112
5845,ELAINE, Are you,112
5846,JERRY, Understand you had a little talk with him too.,112
5847,ELAINE," Yeah, talked earlier.",112
5848,JERRY," Yes I know, I know.",112
5849,ELAINE,. . . What does that mean?,112
5850,JERRY," Nothing, nothing.",112
5851,ELAINE, He didn't mention . . .,112
5852,JERRY, Yes he did.,112
5853,ELAINE, He told you about our conversation?,112
5854,JERRY, We had quite a little chat.,112
5855,ELAINE, He told you about . . .,112
5856,JERRY," Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.",112
5857,ELAINE, He told you all that? How could he?,112
5858,JERRY," It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.",112
5859,ELAINE, Can he do that?,112
5860,JERRY, He did it.,112
5861,ELAINE, But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?,112
5862,JERRY, That's what's so fascinating.,112
5863,JERRY, You better finish your little café latte there. They won't let you in with it.,112
5864,KRAMER, Why not?,112
5865,JERRY, Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.,112
5866,KRAMER, Well that's stupid,112
5867,JERRY, That's the rule.,112
5868,KRAMER," Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.",112
5869,RABBI," Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again.",112
5870,ELAINE, Yeah…,112
5871,RABBI, Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas?,112
5872,ELAINE," No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?",112
5873,RABBI, Was that a problem for you?,112
5874,ELAINE," Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?",112
5875,RABBI," Well, let's see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston in 1F.",112
5876,ELAINE, Mrs. Winston?,112
5877,RABBI," Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going ""to happen"" for you.",112
5878,ELAINE, What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?,112
5879,RABBI, Don Ramsey?,112
5880,ELAINE," You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.",112
5881,RABBI, Oh him! Well this morning I found myself in the elevator with him…,112
5882,ELAINE," my god, you didn't.",112
5883,JERRY," Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me",112
5884,KRAMER," Oh, yow, oow Ah!",112
5885,USHER," Hey, hey, what's going on? What just happened here?",112
5886,KRAMER, Nothing Nothing.,112
5887,USHER, Whatya got? One of those Café Latte's in your shirt?,112
5888,KRAMER, I don't have anything. Ask him.,112
5889,USHER," All right, come on Coffee Boy, bring it out.",112
5890,KRAMER, What?!,112
5891,USHER, Here you go.,112
5892,KRAMER, Ow,112
5893,ELAINE, But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.,112
5894,JERRY," Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.",112
5895,ELAINE," You didn't say this to George, did you?",112
5896,JERRY," No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?",112
5897,ELAINE," Yeah that! So, . . .",112
5898,GEORGE, Hey oh.,112
5899,ELAINE," GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.",112
5900,GEORGE," Alright, thanks a lot.",112
5901,ELAINE," Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.",112
5902,GEORGE," Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...",112
5903,ELAINE," Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.",112
5904,GEORGE," Well, I guess I'm getting older.",112
5905,ELAINE," Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.",112
5906,GEORGE, Yeah.,112
5907,ELAINE," My most, just heartfelt congratulations.",112
5908,GEORGE," Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.",112
5909,ELAINE," Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.",112
5910,GEORGE," Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.",112
5911,ELAINE," Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.",112
5912,GEORGE," Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?",112
5913,JERRY," Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh…",112
5914,GEORGE, Nope. I wept like a baby.,112
5915,JERRY, What?,112
5916,GEORGE," Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.",112
5917,JERRY, You cried?,112
5918,GEORGE," I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.",112
5919,JERRY, Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.,112
5920,KRAMER," Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.",112
5921,JERRY, Suing? What for?,112
5922,KRAMER, The coffee was too hot.,112
5923,JERRY, It's supposed to be hot.,112
5924,KRAMER, Not THAT hot.,112
5925,RABBI,  The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless.,112
5926,GEORGE, Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.,112
5927,RABBI," A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm.",112
5928,GEORGE," And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.",113
5929,ELAINE," I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.",113
5930,GEORGE," Ya know, I was just a little surprised.",113
5931,JERRY, Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?,113
5932,GEORGE, What about all the loser stuff?,113
5933,ELAINE," I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said ""I've never seen you looser"".",113
5934,JERRY," I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.",113
5935,GEORGE,"  Well, scintillating as always.",113
5936,JERRY, Where you going?,113
5937,GEORGE, I'm going shopping with Susan.,113
5938,ELAINE, What kind of shopping?,113
5939,GEORGE, Clothes shopping.,113
5940,ELAINE, Where are you going?,113
5941,GEORGE, Ross'.,113
5942,ELAINE, Oh that's a nice store.,113
5943,GEORGE," Yeah, it's her uncle's.",113
5944,JERRY, Discount?,113
5945,GEORGE,  One would hope.,113
5946,KRAMER," So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte.",113
5947,JACKIE,  Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?,113
5948,KRAMER, Yeah that's right.,113
5949,JACKIE," Half milk, half coffee?",113
5950,KRAMER, Yeah.,113
5951,JACKIE, Hm Hm. You take a sip?,113
5952,KRAMER, Yes I did.,113
5953,JACKIE," Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip it in your normal fashion?",113
5954,KRAMER, No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.,113
5955,JACKIE," Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?",113
5956,KRAMER, Well I think I take a normal sip.,113
5957,JACKIE, O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?,113
5958,KRAMER," Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.",113
5959,JACKIE," Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.",113
5960,KRAMER," Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?",113
5961,JACKIE," Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them. This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous.",113
5962,KRAMER, It's definitely preposterous.,113
5963,JACKIE, So. Then what happened?,113
5964,KRAMER, Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.,113
5965,JACKIE, Was there a top on it?,113
5966,KRAMER, Yeah.,113
5967,JACKIE, Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?,113
5968,KRAMER, No. They put the top on.,113
5969,JACKIE, And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?,113
5970,JACKIE,  Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World. Get me a cafe latte with a top.  We're gonna run some test on that top. Have you been to the doctor?,113
5971,KRAMER," Ah No no, I haven't.",113
5972,JACKIE,  Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me.,113
5973,KRAMER," So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.",113
5974,JACKIE, Jackie.,113
5975,KRAMER," Jackie. I mean, we have a chance?",113
5976,JACKIE," Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you gonna walk outta there a rich man.",113
5977,GEORGE," I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.",113
5978,SUSAN, Well you could use a little flash.,113
5979,GEORGE, All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.,113
5980,SUSAN, Name one.,113
5981,MR ROSS," So, you find anything?",113
5982,SUSAN," Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.",113
5983,MR ROSS, I'm going on vacation to Costa Rica. Maybe I'll see you in a couple of weeks.,113
5984,SUSAN, O.K.,113
5985,SALESMAN, Excuse me Mr Ross.,113
5986,GEORGE, See now this I don't get.,113
5987,SUSAN, What?,113
5988,GEORGE, The security guard.,113
5989,SUSAN, What about him?,113
5990,GEORGE, Why does he have to stand?,113
5991,SUSAN, Because he's a security guard.,113
5992,GEORGE, But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.,113
5993,SUSAN," George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.",113
5994,GEORGE, Aren't you concerned about the security guard?,113
5995,SUSAN, Not really. ,113
5996,GEORGE,  She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.,113
5997,SUSAN, All right George.  What do you think?,113
5998,JERRY," So ah, what did you do last night?",113
5999,ELAINE, Nothing.,113
6000,JERRY," I know nothing, but what did you actually do?",113
6001,ELAINE, Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.,113
6002,JERRY, Wow. That really is nothing.,113
6003,ELAINE, I told ya.,113
6004,KRAMER, Hey.,113
6005,JERRY, Hey.,113
6006,ELAINE, Hey.,113
6007,JERRY, What are you all dressed up for?,113
6008,KRAMER, Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.,113
6009,JERRY," Oh yeah, how's that looking?",113
6010,KRAMER," Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury,  I'm gonna be a rich man.",113
6011,ELAINE, That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.,113
6012,KRAMER," Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.",113
6013,JERRY, Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.,113
6014,KRAMER, Oh I can be quite litigious.,113
6015,ELAINE, What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.,113
6016,KRAMER, Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.,113
6017,ELAINE,  Jackie says the top was faulty.,113
6018,KRAMER, Hey Maestro!,113
6019,MAESTRO," Ah, Kramer.",113
6020,KRAMER, I'm in here. How's it going.,113
6021,MAESTRO, Fine.,113
6022,JERRY, Hi Bob.,113
6023,JERRY,"  Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro.",113
6024,KRAMER," Well, this is a surprise ha?",113
6025,MAESTRO, I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. It's supposed to be great stuff. It's all herbal.,113
6026,KRAMER," Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?",113
6027,MAESTRO, It's nothing.,113
6028,KRAMER," Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.",113
6029,MAESTRO," Oh yeah, I've been at my house in Tuscany.",113
6030,KRAMER, Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.,113
6031,JERRY, I hear it's ah beautiful there.,113
6032,MAESTRO, Well if you're thinking of getting a place there don't bother. There's really nothing available.,113
6033,JERRY,  Huh?,113
6034,MAESTRO,  Oh!,113
6035,ELAINE, Hello.,113
6036,MAESTRO, Well Hello. And who might you be?,113
6037,ELAINE, I might be Elaine.,113
6038,JERRY," This is a, Bob Cobb.",113
6039,KRAMER, Maestro.,113
6040,ELAINE," Oh, Maestro.",113
6041,MAESTRO, It is my very great pleasure. ,113
6042,ELAINE, Enchante.,113
6043,MAESTRO, Well I have to be going.,113
6044,ELAINE, Well I have to be going.,113
6045,ELAINE, Jinx buy me a coke.,113
6046,MAESTRO, Oh. Love it when that happeneds.,113
6047,ELAINE, I know I know. That is so ahh ......,113
6048,MAESTRO, Coincidental.,113
6049,ELAINE," Yeah, thanks. O.K. Bye you guys.",113
6050,MAESTRO, Ciao.,113
6051,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.",113
6052,KRAMER, You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.,113
6053,JERRY," Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?",113
6054,KRAMER, That's right.,113
6055,JERRY, Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.,113
6056,KRAMER, Why?,113
6057,JERRY, Because it's a stupid thing to be called.,113
6058,KRAMER, Jerry he's a conductor.,113
6059,JERRY, Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.,113
6060,KRAMER," Well, he's still a conductor.",113
6061,JERRY, Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.,113
6062,KRAMER," Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.",113
6063,JERRY, New shirt?,113
6064,GEORGE, Yeah. You like it.,113
6065,JERRY," No, not particularly.",113
6066,GEORGE," Why, the color?",113
6067,JERRY, Yeah.,113
6068,GEORGE, Too flashy?,113
6069,JERRY," Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?",113
6070,GEORGE,  No.,113
6071,JERRY,  All right what's it going to be here.,113
6072,GEORGE," Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?",113
6073,JERRY, No.,113
6074,GEORGE," See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.",113
6075,JERRY, Are you sensing anything right now?,113
6076,GEORGE," Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?",113
6077,JERRY," Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.",113
6078,GEORGE," What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this.  Here, watch.  Criminals. Boom. I'm up.  Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!",113
6079,JERRY, Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.,113
6080,GEORGE, Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.,113
6081,JERRY, I know you will.,113
6082,KRAMER," Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.",113
6083,GEORGE, Who?,113
6084,JERRY, His lawyer.,113
6085,KRAMER," Yeah, Java World wants to settle.",113
6086,JERRY, What?,113
6087,KRAMER," Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.",113
6088,JERRY, Why are they settling?,113
6089,KRAMER, Cause their afraid of bad publicity.,113
6090,JERRY, All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?,113
6091,KRAMER, Yeah that's right.,113
6092,GEORGE,  I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!,113
6093,MAESTRO, And then about four years ago I was on holiday in Tuscany.,113
6094,ELAINE, Uh ha.,113
6095,MAESTRO, And I fell in love with this house.,113
6096,WAITER, Are you ready to order?,113
6097,ELAINE, Oh God. What are you getting Bob?,113
6098,MAESTRO, Good question.  We'll need a few minutes.,113
6099,MAESTRO," You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I preferred to be called Maestro.",113
6100,ELAINE, Excuse me?,113
6101,MAESTRO," Well, ya know I am a conductor.",113
6102,ELAINE," Yeah, so?",113
6103,MAESTRO, Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called Maestro and I don't.,113
6104,ELAINE," Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.",113
6105,MAESTRO," I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said ""Hello Maestro, how about a beer"". O.K. So that's a fact.",113
6106,ELAINE, Maestro huh? O.K. ,113
6107,KRAMER, Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look..,113
6108,JERRY, What do you mean?,113
6109,KRAMER," Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it.",113
6110,JERRY, So?,113
6111,KRAMER, So? My lawsuit. I'm finished.,113
6112,JERRY, I thought they wanted to settle.,113
6113,KRAMER, Well what happens if they want to see it?,113
6114,JERRY, Then you're in a lot of trouble.,113
6115,KRAMER, Yeah!!,113
6116,GEORGE,  Tired?,113
6117,GUARD, No.,113
6118,GEORGE," How come uh, no chair?",113
6119,GUARD, What?,113
6120,GEORGE," I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.",113
6121,GUARD, I don't need a chair.,113
6122,GEORGE," No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?",113
6123,GUARD, Nope.,113
6124,GEORGE, Would you like a chair?,113
6125,GUARD, I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down.,113
6126,GEORGE," Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?",113
6127,GUARD," Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking.",113
6128,GEORGE, That's exactly my point.,113
6129,GUARD, Well who wouldn't?,113
6130,GEORGE," Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down.  That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.",113
6131,JACKIE," You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on.",113
6132,KRAMER, I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?,113
6133,JACKIE, Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway?,113
6134,KRAMER, The Maestro.,113
6135,JACKIE, The who? What are you talking about Maestro?,113
6136,KRAMER, My friend he's a conductor.,113
6137,JACKIE," Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?",113
6138,KRAMER, Well my stomach was burning.,113
6139,JACKIE, I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.,113
6140,KRAMER, Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.,113
6141,JACKIE, Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read the instructions?,113
6142,KRAMER, Well I ...,113
6143,JACKIE,  No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.,113
6144,KRAMER, I'm sorry Jackie.,113
6145,JACKIE,  Pull over here driver this is it.,113
6146,KRAMER,"  Yeah, get over.",113
6147,JERRY, Did you have a good time?,113
6148,ELAINE," Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.",113
6149,JERRY,"  Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.",113
6150,ELAINE, Really?,113
6151,JERRY," So what about the ""Maestro"" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.",113
6152,ELAINE," Yeah, I called him Maestro.",113
6153,JERRY, You didn't mind?,113
6154,ELAINE," Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.",113
6155,JERRY," O.K. from now on I want you to call me ""Jerry the Great"".",113
6156,ELAINE," I am not calling you ""Jerry the Great"".",113
6157,JERRY, Why not you call him Maestro.,113
6158,ELAINE, He is a Maestro.,113
6159,JERRY," Well, I'm great.",113
6160,ELAINE, So you say.,113
6161,JERRY," What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?",113
6162,ELAINE, Yeah.  I'm invited.,113
6163,JERRY," You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.",113
6164,ELAINE, Why?,113
6165,JERRY, I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.,113
6166,ELAINE," Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.",113
6167,JERRY, In all of Tuscany? I wonder.,113
6168,MR STAR," I say we offer him $50,000 that's it, take it or leave it.",113

6181,KRAMER, Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.,113
6182,JACKIE, Free coffee?,113

6195,JERRY, No. I'm not really looking.,113
6196,MAESTRO, Nor should you.,113
6197,JERRY, So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?,113
6198,MAESTRO," The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard.",113
6199,JERRY," I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?",113
6200,MAESTRO, It's booked solid!,113
6201,ELAINE, It's BOOKED Jerry!,113
6202,JERRY, How'd you get yours?,113
6203,MAESTRO," Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some Verdi.",113
6204,JERRY, Maybe I'll check out France.,113
6205,JERRY," Hey George, do you believe this guy?",113
6206,GEORGE, Who?,113
6207,JERRY, Bob Cobb.,113
6208,GEORGE, Bob Cobb?,113
6209,JERRY," You know, the Maestro.",113

6211,JERRY," Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.",113
6212,GEORGE, Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?,113
6213,JERRY, No.,113
6214,GEORGE, So what do you care?,113
6215,JERRY, I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.,113
6216,GEORGE, Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?,113
6217,JERRY, I have no idea.,113
6218,GEORGE, It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.,113
6219,JERRY," Oh, no way it's that big.",113
6220,GEORGE, It's a big region.,113
6221,JERRY, Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?,113
6222,GEORGE, I don't know why I bother even talking to you.,113
6223,JERRY," Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.",113
6224,GEORGE, All right.,113
6225,GEORGE, So I spoke to the security guard.,113
6226,JERRY, Yeah and?,113
6227,GEORGE," Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.",113
6228,JERRY, So are you gonna get him a chair?,113
6229,GEORGE, Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.,113
6230,JERRY," Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.",113
6231,GEORGE, Oh I think I'd go for the back.,113
6232,JERRY, Swivel?,113
6233,GEORGE, I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.,113
6234,JERRY, I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.,113
6235,GEORGE, You mean one of those vinyl things?,113
6236,JERRY, Yes.,113
6237,GEORGE," Vinyl yeah, maybe.",113
6238,JERRY, How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.,113
6239,GEORGE," Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.",113
6240,JERRY," Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.",113
6241,GEORGE, What do you think about a rocking chair?,113
6242,KRAMER,"  You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.",113
6243,JERRY," Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?",113
6244,KRAMER," Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.",113
6245,JERRY, That's it?,113
6246,KRAMER," That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.",113
6247,JERRY, You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.,113
6248,KRAMER, Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.,113

6258,GEORGE, I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.,113
6259,CLERK," I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.",113
6260,GEORGE, Innocent mistake.,113
6261,GEORGE," Well, here you go. What do you think?",113
6262,GUARD, Mr. Ross says this is O.K.?,113
6263,GEORGE," Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.",113
6264,GUARD, Not bad. Not bad at all.,113
6265,JERRY," Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.",113
6266,GIGGIO," Si, Si, imma Giggio.",113

6272,GIGGIO, Si. Two million lira. You give me the check.,113

6274,GIGGIO," The keys, here are the keys. You give me the check. Two million lira. Seventeen hundred Americana. Molto generoso.",113
6275,GIGGIO,"  Si, Si.",113
6276,JERRY," So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.",113
6277,GIGGIO, Si.  Thissa one!. Capiche?,113
6278,ELAINE," It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.",113
6279,MAESTRO," I told you, it's paradise.",113
6280,ELAINE, You're right Maestro.,113
6281,KRAMER," Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.",113
6282,JERRY, You didn't have to push me.,113
6283,KRAMER, I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?,113
6284,JERRY," 75,000 lira.",113
6285,KRAMER," 75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?",113
6286,JERRY, Kramer you don't under the conversion rate.,113
6287,KRAMER," Oh, conversion rate, oh.",113
6288,JERRY, You know I don't even know why I brought you.,113
6289,KRAMER, Nobody put a gun to your head.,113
6290,JERRY, Not bad!,113
6291,KRAMER, Yeah!,113
6292,ELAINE, Hello,114
6293,JAMES, This is your wake up service. It's 7,114
6294,ELAINE," Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.",114
6295,JAMES, Hot date last night?,114
6296,ELAINE, I wish.,114
6297,JAMES, A woman with a sexy voice like yours its hard to believe your waking up alone.,114
6298,ELAINE," Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.",114
6299,JAMES, Call me James.,114
6300,ELAINE," Oh, all right, James. He he he",114
6301,GEORGE, Your wake up guy asked you out?,114
6302,ELAINE," Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,",114
6303,JERRY, I don't know. Blind date?,114
6304,ELAINE, What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.,114
6305,JERRY," Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.",114
6306,ELAINE, At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.,114
6307,JERRY, I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.,114
6308,ELAINE," Ah, . . .",114
6309,GEORGE, Now you're off on a topic.,114
6310,JERRY," You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.",114
6311,ELAINE, Uh hu.,114
6312,JERRY, Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.,114
6313,GEORGE, You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.,114
6314,ELAINE, I think she'd figure it out.,114
6315,ELAINE, What? What is this?,114
6316,JERRY, Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.,114
6317,ELAINE, Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?,114
6318,JERRY, A healthy person.,114
6319,GEORGE,"  Ow, Ow you squirted me.",114
6320,JERRY," Oh, sorry",114
6321,GEORGE," Boy, it stings.",114
6322,WILHELM," George, have you seen Morgan?",114
6323,GEORGE, No.,114
6324,WILHELM, He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?,114
6325,GEORGE," No, not that I know of. ",114
6326,WILHELM," Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.",114
6327,GEORGE, Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. ,114
6328,WILHELM, I understand.,114
6329,JERRY," I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.",114
6330,ELAINE, I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.,114
6331,JERRY, You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?,114
6332,ELAINE, I think I can tell.,114
6333,JERRY," Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?",114
6334,ELAINE, Twenty-five percent.,114
6335,JERRY," Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.",114
6336,ELAINE, You're way off.,114
6337,JERRY, Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.,114
6338,ELAINE, So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?,114
6339,JERRY, UNDATEABLE!,114
6340,ELAINE, Then how are all these people getting together?,114
6341,JERRY, Alcohol.,114
6342,ELAINE,  What is your problem?,114
6343,GEORGE, No problem here.,114
6344,ELAINE, You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.,114
6345,GEORGE, I had no idea.,114
6346,ELAINE, Right there. Right there. You just did it again.,114
6347,GEORGE, Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.,114
6348,ELAINE, You're eye still hurts?,114
6349,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.",114
6350,JERRY, Pulp couldn't make it across the table.,114
6351,GEORGE," Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?",114
6352,JERRY," Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.",114
6353,GEORGE, Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.,114
6354,ELAINE," What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?",114
6355,GEORGE," Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.",114
6356,KRAMER, Hi guys.,114
6357,JERRY," Hi,",114
6358,KRAMER," Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?",114
6359,GEORGE, Yeah.,114
6360,KRAMER, And Buck Showalter's?,114
6361,GEORGE, It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.,114
6362,KRAMER," Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.",114
6363,GEORGE," Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. ",114
6364,KRAMER," No, of course not. ",114
6365,KRAMER," You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.",114
6366,STEINBRENNER, I don't know. An envelope doesn't really cut it.,114
6367,KRAMER, Why?,114
6368,STEINBRENNER, What is this? A birthday card. Ha ha . . . signed by the ENTIRE Yankee organization! . . . This could be worth something.,114
6369,GEORGE, Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?,114
6370,MORGAN, Hello.,114
6371,MORGAN," Oh, by the way, have you got that birthday card?",114

6380,JERRY," Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.",114
6381,HOLLY, . . . You don't eat meat? Are you one of those. . .,114
6382,JERRY," Well, no, I'm not one of those.",114
6383,HOLLY, When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee and then dinner here.,114
6384,JERRY, Grandma Memma?,114
6385,HOLLY, Elaine must have mentioned Grandma Memma.,114
6386,JERRY," No, I think I would have remembered Memma.",114
6387,HOLLY," Oh well, that's typical. Elaine never liked Grandma Memma.",114
6388,WAITER, Ready?,114
6389,HOLLY," I'll have the porterhouse medium rare, baked potato with sour cream,",114

6403,GEORGE," Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?",114
6404,MORGAN, I had to cancel it. For some reason my wife got it into her head that it was more than just a massage.,114

6406,MORGAN," Yeah, we had this big fight at lunch it looks like tonight I will be sleeping on the couch.",114
6407,GEORGE," Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.",114

6412,MORGAN, Just make sure Steinbrenner doesn't get it until I sign it.,114
6413,GEORGE, Yes sir!,114
6414,ELAINE, I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.,114
6415,JERRY, Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?,114
6416,ELAINE, Huh huh.,114
6417,JERRY, Did she mention anything about our lunch?,114
6418,ELAINE," Uh, kind of.",114
6419,JERRY," What do you mean, ""kind of.""?",114

6462,BOBBY, Would he? Paul O'Neill would do that?,114
6463,KRAMER, For you he would.,114
6464,BOBBY, Would he hit two home runs?,114
6465,KRAMER," Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.",114
6466,BOBBY, I know. Get out of this bed one day and walk again.,114
6467,KRAMER," Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.",114
6468,ELAINE, What about this candelabra?,114
6469,HOLLY," Yeah, that was grandma Memma's also. She bought it on her trip to Europe in 1936. Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton. I was afrais you only ate . . . salad.",114
6470,JERRY," Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.",114
6471,HOLLY, That is so funny. Did you just make that up?,114
6472,JERRY, I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? ,114
6473,HOLLY, That was in Grandma's study.,114
6474,ELAINE," What did you do, ransack the place after she died?",114
6475,JERRY, This is some FINE mutton.,114
6476,ELAINE, I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?,114
6477,JERRY," Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . ",114
6478,ELAINE," It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.",114
6479,ELAINE," Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.",114
6480,HOLLY, Where are the napkins?,114
6481,JERRY, What?,114
6482,HOLLY, Grandma Memma's napkins. There's two missing. Elaine took them didn't she?,114
6483,JERRY, I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?,114
6484,HOLLY, You heard her. She coveted them. I bet she took them just to spite me. She's probably having a good laugh about it right now.,114
6485,ELAINE, Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a,114
6486,JERRY," Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?",114
6487,ELAINE, Did you do with the dogs?,114
6488,JERRY," Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?",114
6489,ELAINE, These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.,114
6490,JERRY, Why were dogs chasing you?,114
6491,ELAINE, They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.,114
6492,JERRY, I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.,114
6493,ELAINE, We'll have to sleep head to toe.,114
6494,JERRY, Head to toe?,114
6495,ELAINE, Head to toe.,114
6496,ELAINE," Hey, wake up. It's 8",114
6497,JERRY, I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.,114
6498,ELAINE, You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?,114
6499,JERRY, I'll make them later. Uh.,114
6500,WILHELM, Have you seen Morgan?,114
6501,GEORGE, He's not here?,114
6502,WILHELM," No, He's late.",114
6503,GEORGE, It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.,114
6504,WILHELM," Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job.",114
6505,GEORGE, . . . gone?,114
6506,JERRY, It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.,114
6507,GEORGE," I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.",114
6508,ELAINE," Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.",114
6509,GEORGE, Napkins?,114
6510,ELAINE," I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.",114
6511,JERRY, Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.,114
6512,ELAINE, They were?,114
6513,JERRY, Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.,114
6514,ELAINE, Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.,114
6515,GEORGE, What exactly is mutton?,114
6516,JERRY, I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?,114
6517,ELAINE," Oh, I must have left it at Jame's",114
6518,JERRY, You spent the night at James's? Did we?,114
6519,ELAINE, Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.,114
6520,JERRY, Reversed positions?,114
6521,ELAINE," Yeah, you know, head to toe.",114
6522,JERRY, So what your genitals are still lined up.,114
6523,ELAINE," No, because I slept with my back to him.",114
6524,KRAMER, Mr. O'Neill?,114
6525,KRAMER," Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me.",114
6526,KRAMER," No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.",114
6527,KRAMER," Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.",114
6528,KRAMER," You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers.",114
6529,KRAMER," Yeah, well, no good?",114
6530,KRAMER, Two is better than one.,114
6531,KRAMER," Well, Babe Ruth did it.",114
6532,KRAMER," Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?",114
6533,KRAMER," Well, maybe I did overextend myself.",114
6534,JAMES,"  Oh, hi Elaine. You know I lost all of my 6",114
6535,TV, The Yankees take the field on a beautiful afternoon.,114
6536,KRAMER," It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?",114
6537,BOBBY, After Paul O'Neill hits his first home run.,114
6538,HOLLY,  It's Holly.,114
6539,JERRY, Yeah. Come on up.,114
6540,TV, And the two and one pitch to O'Neill. A towering shot back to deep right field and it's gone.,114
6541,KRAMER, Yeah.,114
6542,TV, A home run for Paul O'Neill. The Yanks lead one nothing.,114
6543,KRAMER, OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT!,114
6544,BOBBY, One more to go.,114
6545,JERRY, Hey. What's all this?,114
6546,HOLLY, I decided I was going to make you dinner.,114
6547,JERRY, I thought we were going out.,114
6548,HOLLY," Well, after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge to make pork chops for you. I said hello to Franco for you.",114
6549,JERRY, Franco?,114
6550,HOLLY," Your butcher, down the street.",114
6551,JERRY, I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.,114
6552,HOLLY, A little.,114
6553,JERRY, That is so Franco.,114
6554,TV," Bottom of the eighth, score tied at one apiece. Two and one to Paul O'Neill.",114
6555,KRAMER," You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.",114
6556,KRAMER," He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.",114
6557,TV," ""Klick! Long fly ball into deep left field over Bell's head . . . O'Neill's rounding second O'Neill going for third, O'Neill rounding . . .",114
6558,KRAMER, Come on Come on!,114
6559,TV, . . . third being waived in.,114
6560,KRAMER, GO! GO!!,114
6561,TV, . . . Martinez throws it over Alomar's head. O'Neill is safe at home. And the Yankees take the lead.,114
6562,KRAMER, An In The Park Home Run!,114
6563,BOBBY, Yeay!,114
6564,KRAMER," All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way ",114
6565,TV, That's being scored a triple for Paul O'Neill with a throwing error charged to Martinez.,114
6566,BOBBY," Hey, …",114
6567,KRAMER, Huh?,114
6568,BOBBY, … that's not a home run. ,114
6569,KRAMER," Yeah, maybe not technically, but …",114
6570,BOBBY, You said he'd hit two home runs.,114
6571,KRAMER," Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!",114
6572,BOBBY," Well, you're not taking that card.",114
6573,KRAMER," Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that …",114
6574,HOLLY," So, is the chop the way you like it?",114
6575,JERRY, I usually like mine with an angioplasty.,114
6576,ELAINE, You know something really stinks to high h… Holly! What are you doing here?,114
6577,JERRY, What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.,114
6578,ELAINE," I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.",114
6579,HOLLY, What about the napkins?,114
6580,ELAINE, I didn't take your napkins.,114
6581,HOLLY, Then who did?,114
6582,ELAINE, Ask Jerry.,114
6583,JERRY, We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.,114
6584,WILHELM," I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?",114
6585,MORGAN," No sir, George never gave it to me.",114
6586,GEORGE," No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .",114
6587,KRAMER," Hi,",114
6588,WILHELM, What's this?													KRAMER,114
6589,KRAMER,"  Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.",114
6590,WILHELM," George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going to have it mounted like this?",114
6591,KRAMER, And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.,114
6592,WILHELM," Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work.",114
6593,MORGAN," Ha ha, uh, well you screwed me again, Costanza. How am I supposed to sign the card now when it's already under glass?",114
6594,ELAINE," Uh, this is,…",114
6595,HOLLY, Excuse me. What are those dogs wearing?,114
6596,JAMES," Oh, bandanas, aren't they cute?",114
6597,HOLLY, You gave Memma's napkins to some dogs?!,114
6598,JERRY," Hey, what happened to my jacket?",114
6599,JAMES," Oh, the dogs did that but it wasn't their fault, somebody stuffed some strange meat in the pocket.",114
6600,HOLLY, Was it mutton?,114
6601,JAMES, Could have been.,114
6602,HOLLY, Do you always stuff meat in your pocket?,114
6603,JERRY," Uh, sometimes I use the sofa.",114
6604,GEORGE," You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?",114
6605,STEINBRENNER," Yes, George, please, come in, come in.",114
6606,STEINBRENNER," Thanks for the card. I loved it. Gosh it made me feel good. You know, word has it that you were the brains behind the whole thing.",114
6607,GEORGE," Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.",114
6608,STEINBRENNER," Morgan, Morgan, you know his name is conspicuously absent from this card. Almost like he went out of his way not to sign it.",114
6609,GEORGE," Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.",114
6610,STEINBRENNER," You can stop kowtowing to Morgan. Congratulations, you got his job.",114
6611,GEORGE," Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.",114
6612,STEINBRENNER," Stop it George, he's out, you're in.",114
6613,STEINBRENNER, A lot more work you know.,114
6614,GEORGE, I know.,114
6615,STEINBRENNER, A lot more responsibility. Long long hours.,114
6616,GEORGE, I know.,114
6617,STEINBRENNER, Not much more money. But you'll finally get the recognition you deserve.,114
6618,GEORGE," That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .",114
6619,STEINBRENNER," You know as painfull as it is I had to let a few people go over the years. Yogi Berra, Lou Pinella, Bucky Dent, Billy Martin, Dallas Green, Dick Houser, Bill Virdon, Billy Martin, Scott Marrow, Billy Martin, Bob Lemmon, Billy Martin, Gene Michael, Buck Showalter, … uh, tut!, . . .George, you didn't hear that from me.  . . . George!",114

I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!... And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver......gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.",115
6621,JERRY,  I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog.  Get this one,115
6622,GEORGE, This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.,115
6623,ELAINE, Yeah. What do you do all day?,115
6624,GEORGE, Not that much.,115
6625,ELAINE, uh-uh.,115
6626,JERRY, I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.,115
6627,GEORGE," Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.",115
6628,JERRY, How do you pull that off?,115
6629,GEORGE," I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... .",115
6630,ELAINE," Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!",115
6631,JERRY," Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!",115
6632,GEORGE, I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right.  Back to work. ,115
6633,ELAINE, ,115
6634,JERRY, So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?,115
6635,ELAINE," No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.",115
6636,JERRY, What marathon runner?,115
6637,ELAINE," You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...",115
6638,JERRY," Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!",115
6639,ELAINE," Yeah, that's him.",115
6640,JERRY," He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?",115
6641,ELAINE," Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. ",115
6642,JERRY, How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?,115
6643,ELAINE," Ah, I know. I know...!",115
6644,JERRY," I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...",115
6645,ELAINE," Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.",115
6646,JERRY, Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.,115
6647,ELAINE, What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.,115
6648,JERRY, You gotta wake him up!,115
6649,ELAINE, Eh...he'll get up...,115
6650,ELAINE," Hi, Judy.",115
6651,JUDY," Hi, Elaine. How are you?",115

6654,ELAINE, Yeah.,115
6655,JERRY, I didn't know she was married.,115
6656,ELAINE,  She's not... and the guy just took off.  Don't say anything to anybody.,115
6657,JERRY, Whom I gonna tell?,115
6658,ELAINE," I know, it's just something you have to say...",115
6659,WILHELM," George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items, but I don't think there's gonna be a problem.  I'll let you get back to work, George. ",115
6660,JERRY, He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?,115
6661,GEORGE, I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.,115
6662,JERRY, My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on.  Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.,115
6663,KRAMER, Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.,115
6664,JERRY, What do you do?,115
6665,KRAMER, I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and...  ...I get up!,115
6666,JERRY, Always works?,115
6667,KRAMER," It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.",115
6668,GEORGE, uh-uh. What's with the bucket?,115
6669,KRAMER," Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.",115
6670,JERRY, Hot tub?,115
6671,KRAMER," Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. ",115
6672,GEORGE, You put a hot tub... in your living room?,115
6673,KRAMER," Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! ",115
6674,GEORGE, Is that tolerable?,115
6675,KRAMER, Oh...it's tolerable...! ,115
6676,JERRY, Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?,115
6677,KRAMER," Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... ",115
6678,GEORGE, He uh...doesn't have any running water?,115
6679,JERRY, I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.,115
6680,ELAINE," Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.",115
6681,JERRY," Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you.",115
6682,JERRY, Sorry about the Olympics.,115

6685,ELAINE," Yeah, that's funny. ",115
6686,JERRY,"  So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?",115
6687,JERRY, AM/PM.,115
6688,JERRY, Ah...the volume.,115
6689,JERRY," Ah, separate knob.",115
6690,JERRY, Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.,115
6691,JERRY," Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.",115
6692,JERRY," Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?",115
6693,ELAINE, Jerry...,115
6694,JERRY, It's a simple question...,115
6695,ELAINE," I've got an alarm, ok?",115
6696,JERRY, That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?,115
6697,ELAINE, It works.,115
6698,JERRY, Elaine...,115
6699,ELAINE, It... works!,115
6700,GEORGE, Eh...come oooon...,115
6701,WILHELM, George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.,115
6702,GEORGE, Well...I've got a lot to do!,115
6703,WILHELM," George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.",115
6704,WILHELM, I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a good time.,115
6705,ELAINE, Hey. Sorry I'm late.,115
6706,JERRY, You're 40 minutes late. What happened?,115
6707,ELAINE, I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?,115
6708,JERRY, No.,115
6709,ELAINE, What?  What is the problem?,115
6710,JERRY," Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.",115
6711,ELAINE, uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?,115
6712,JERRY," Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!",115
6713,ELAINE, Oh are you?!,115
6714,JERRY, Yes I am.,115
6715,ELAINE," Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!",115
6716,JERRY," Yeah, I know that!",115
6717,ELAINE," Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!",115
6718,JERRY, I'm not talking about upside down.  I'm talking about waking him up!,115
6719,ELAINE," Hey, Jean-Paul.",115
6720,JERRY," Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?",115
6721,KRAMER,  What's burning?,115
6722,ELAINE," Oh!  My muffin!  Oh, shoot! ",115
6723,JERRY, What happened?,115
6724,ELAINE, Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.,115
6725,KRAMER, This was set for 2 minutes. See?,115
6726,ELAINE,  Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!,115
6727,ELAINE,"  Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.",115
6728,ELAINE,"  All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?",115
6729,JERRY, Yeah. I hope so ?!,115
6730,ELAINE, Oh that's cute! ,115

6745,GEORGE, Well...maybe not as much as this bastard...  I can hold my own! ,115
6746,JERRY," Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...",115
6747,JERRY," I'm saying ""get the hell outta there""! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!",115

6750,JERRY," Hey, how was the meeting?",115
6751,GEORGE, I really like those sons of bitches.,115
6752,JERRY, Sons of bitches?,115
6753,GEORGE," Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh...""boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!"" ",115
6754,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. ",115

6758,GEORGE, What's goin'on?,115
6759,KRAMER, I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!,115

6806,JERRY," I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.",115
6807,MAN, Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important than any of our guests.,115

6813,JERRY,"  No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!",115
6814,JERRY, What if he doesn't call now out of spite?,115
6815,JERRY,  Not comfortable... ,115

6819,JUDY," You have got some nerve, Elaine! I told you about that baby in confidence!",115
6820,ELAINE, Oh I didn't tell anyone.,115
6821,JUDY, Well your friend certainly seemed to know all about it. ,115
6822,ELAINE, ... Jerry! ,115
6823,JERRY," Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.",115
6824,JERRY," Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. ",115
6825,JERRY," That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. ",115
6826,JERRY,  Man that thing is noisy!,115
6827,KRAMER,"  Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!",115
6828,JERRY," Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 6",115
6829,KRAMER," Yeah, ok. Wait.  Done! ",115
6830,JERRY, He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.,115
6831,JERRY," Frankly, I'm a little concerned.",115
6832,ELAINE," Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet  ...my feet are resilient!  Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!!  Yes!",115
6833,JERRY, 4,115

6836,KRAMER," Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!",115
6837,JERRY, What happened to your mental alarm?!,115
6838,KRAMER, I guess I hit the snooze... ,115
6839,JERRY," Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! ",115
6840,GUAD," Hey, hold it!",115
6841,GUARD, Go ahead.,115
6842,JERRY," All right, go, it's a race! Come on!",115
6843,GEORGE," You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?",115
6844,STEINBRENNER," Yes, George, come in, come in. George, word up's you've been cracking under the pressure. Can't cope, can't stand the heat. Spit the bit.",115
6845,GEORGE," Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...",115
6846,STEINBRENNER," Oh we all get a little cuckoo sometimes George, I used to be like you. Rating personnel 'till they cried, calling managers on the field during a game, threatening to move the team to New Jersey, just to upset people. Then I found a way to relax. I've got two words to say to you, George hot tub. ",115
6847,JERRY," I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!",115
6848,ELAINE," Then how did she find out, Jerry?!",115
6849,JERRY, Maybe you should check with the rabbi.,115
6850,KRAMER,  You want some hot tea?,115
6851,ELAINE," Oh no, thank you.",115
6852,KRAMER, Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!,115
6853,ELAINE, There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading!  Go Jean-Paul!,115
6854,KRAMER, Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on! ,115
6855,JERRY," Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!",115
6856,ELAINE, Go Jean-Paaaaaul!,115
6857,STEINBRENNER," How're you enjoying it, George? Melts that tension away, doesn't it? You gotta get that jet on the good spot. Oh. Oh. Uh. Uh. Yes, that feels good. Yes, that's real good. Oh yeah, that's where I keep all my tension. Right down to that chicken bone. Sometimes I get my wife to just stuck her thumb right in there like a screwdriver. Ya know, the Phillips head, not the flat one. Oh God, those flat ones frustrate me. You got it in, but it slips out. You put it in again, slips out again. You a single man, George?",115
6858,GEORGE,"  Well, I-I just recently uh...",115
6859,STEINBRENNER," I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild goin'on in your life, you get a girl and bring her to one o'these things. Just like 4 shots a wild turkey.  She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy.  A show, about that Mickey Mantle, wasn't it? You know we used to talk. I don't think he liked me very much, you know.",115
6860,GEORGE," All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.",116
6861,JERRY, Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?,116
6862,SHEILA, You called me shmoppy. You're a shmoopy.,116
6863,JERRY, You're a shmoopy!,116
6864,SHEILA, You're a shmoopy!,116
6865,JERRY, You're a shmoopy!,116
6866,GEORGE," All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.",116
6867,JERRY," Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?",116
6868,SHEILA, No. You have a good lunch. But I'll meet you back here for the movie.,116
6869,GEORGE, Hey.,116
6870,ELAINE, Hey.,116
6871,SHEILA, Hi Elaine.,116
6872,ELAINE, Hi Sheila.,116
6873,JERRY," All right, then. I'll see you later.",116
6874,SHEILA, Bye shmoopy.,116
6875,JERRY, Bye shmoopy.,116
6876,ELAINE, Okay. We ready to go?,116
6877,GEORGE," Yes. Please. Please, let's go.",116
6878,ELAINE," Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.",116
6879,JERRY, No. We gotta go to the soup place.,116
6880,ELAINE, What soup place?,116
6881,GEORGE," Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.",116
6882,JERRY," He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.",116
6883,ELAINE, Stunned by soup?,116
6884,JERRY," You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.",116
6885,ELAINE, Huh. All right. Come on.,116
6886,JERRY," There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.",116
6887,ELAINE, Why? What happens if you don't order right?,116
6888,JERRY, He yells and you don't get your soup.,116
6889,ELAINE, What?,116
6890,JERRY, Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.,116
6891,GEORGE, All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.,116
6892,JERRY, All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.,116
6893,ELAINE, What?,116
6894,JERRY, The main thing is to keep the line moving.,116
6895,GEORGE," All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.",116
6896,JERRY, Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.,116
6897,ELAINE," Oh, boy, I'm really scared!",116
6898,JERRY, Elaine.,116
6899,ELAINE," All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.",116
6900,JERRY, Ar-moire.,116
6901,ELAINE, How much is this?,116
6902,FURNITURE GUY," I was asking 250, but you got a nice face. 2 even.",116
6903,ELAINE," Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.",116
6904,JERRY, He gave you the nice face discount.,116
6905,ELAINE, Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.,116
6906,JERRY, What about the soup?,116
6907,ELAINE," I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.",116
6908,JERRY, [in French accent] Pardon.,116
6909,GEORGE, This line is huge.,116
6910,JERRY, It's like this all the time.,116
6911,GEORGE, Isn't that that Bania guy?,116
6912,JERRY," Oh, no. It is. Just be still.",116
6913,GEORGE, Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.,116
6914,BANIA," Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.",116
6915,JERRY, Hard to believe.,116
6916,BANIA," This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.",116
6917,JERRY," Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.",116
6918,BANIA, Why not?,116
6919,JERRY," Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.",116
6920,BANIA, Okay. Okay.,116
6921,GEORGE, Medium turkey chili.,116
6922,JERRY, Medium crab bisque.,116
6923,GEORGE, I didn't get any bread.,116
6924,JERRY, Just forget it. Let it go.,116
6925,GEORGE," Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.",116
6926,SOUP NAZI, Bread -- $2 extra.,116
6927,GEORGE, $2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.,116
6928,SOUP NAZI, You want bread?,116
6929,GEORGE," Yes, please.",116
6930,SOUP NAZI, $3!,116
6931,GEORGE, What?,116
6932,SOUP NAZI, No soup for you! [snaps fingers],116
6933,ELAINE, What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.,116
6934,SUPER," Its Sunday, Elaine. There's no moving on Sunday. That's the rule.",116
6935,ELAINE," But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.",116
6936,SUPER," Tomorrow, okay? You can move it in tommorrow. I'll even give you a hand, all right?",116
6937,ELAINE," Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.",116
6938,FURNITURE GUY, I'm a guy on the sidewalk. I don't have layaway.,116
6939,ELAINE," Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.",116
6940,JERRY," Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?",116
6941,GEORGE," You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?",116
6942,JERRY, I gave you a taste. What do you want?,116
6943,GEORGE, Why can't we share?,116
6944,JERRY," I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!",116
6945,GEORGE, Do you hear yourself?,116
6946,JERRY, I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.,116
6947,GEORGE," Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.",116
6948,SHEILA, Hi. Hi shmoopy.,116
6949,JERRY, Hi shmoopy.,116
6950,SHEILA," No, you're a shmoopy!",116
6951,JERRY, You're a shmoopy!,116
6952,GEORGE, I'm going.,116
6953,JERRY," Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?",116
6954,GEORGE," You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.",116
6955,JERRY, Why?,116
6956,GEORGE, I just don't feel like it anymore.,116
6957,JERRY, Just like that?,116
6958,GEORGE, Just like that.,116
6959,SHEILA," Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?",116
6960,KRAMER, Hey.,116
6961,JERRY, Hey.,116
6962,KRAMER, [taking Jerry's couch cushion] Yeah.,116
6963,JERRY, Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?,116
6964,KRAMER," Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.",116
6965,JERRY," Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.",116
6966,KRAMER," Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!",116
6967,ELAINE," Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.",116
6968,KRAMER," Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.",116
6969,ELAINE, Do you need anything?,116
6970,KRAMER," Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.",116
6971,ELAINE, Mulligatawny?,116
6972,KRAMER, Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.,116
6973,ELAINE, Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?,116
6974,KRAMER, He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.,116
6975,ELAINE, All right. I'll be back.,116
6976,KRAMER, Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.,116
6977,ELAINE," Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.",116
6978,KRAMER," No. No, Elaine!",116
6979,ELAINE," Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?",116
6980,GEORGE, No. I didn't get it.,116
6981,ELAINE, Why? What happened?,116
6982,GEORGE, I made a mistake.,116
6983,ELAINE, [laughing],116
6984,GEORGE," All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.",116
6985,ELAINE," Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.",116
6986,GEORGE," Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?",116
6987,ELAINE," Oh, I know! It is awful!",116
6988,GEORGE, Why do they have to do that in front of people?,116
6989,ELAINE, I don't know.,116
6990,GEORGE, What is that with the shmoopy?,116
6991,ELAINE, Ohh!,116
6992,GEORGE," The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!",116
6993,ELAINE, Ohh! Stop it! I know.,116
6994,GEORGE, I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.,116
6995,ELAINE, Ugh!,116
6996,GEORGE, And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.,116
6997,ELAINE," You know, we should say something.",116
6998,GEORGE," You know, we absolutely should.",116
6999,ELAINE," I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?",116
7000,GEORGE, I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.,116
7001,ELAINE, Yeah.,116
7002,GEORGE, I still haven't figured him out.,116
7003,ELAINE, No. Me neither.,116
7004,GEORGE, All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.,116
7005,ELAINE," Oh, God!",116
7006,GEORGE, Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.,116

7010,SOUP NAZI, Yes.,116
7011,ELAINE," Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, "" Scent Of A Woman."" Who-ah! Who-ah!",116
7012,SOUP NAZI, Very good. Very good.,116
7013,ELAINE," Well, I --",116

7023,KRAMER, Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?,116
7024,BOB, What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.,116
7025,KRAMER, You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.,116
7026,BOB," Look, you wanna get hurt?",116
7027,KRAMER, Huh?,116
7028,BOB," I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can hurt you. Now, just back off.",116
7029,RAY, Bob.,116
7030,BOB, Just pick it up.,116
7031,KRAMER," What is this, huh?",116
7032,BOB, You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding? We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay?,116
7033,ELAINE," I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.",116
7034,GEORGE," Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.",116
7035,ELAINE," All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?",116
7036,KRAMER," Well, b -- it was stolen.",116
7037,ELAINE, Wha--?,116
7038,KRAMER," These street toughs, they robbed me.",116
7039,ELAINE, Street toughs took my armoire?,116
7040,KRAMER, Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.,116
7041,ELAINE, I can't believe this!,116
7042,KRAMER," Well, where's the soup?",116
7043,ELAINE, Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.,116
7044,KRAMER, Oh...yeah!,116
7045,JERRY, What are you gonna get?,116
7046,SHEILA, I'll decide at the last minute.,116
7047,JERRY," You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!",116
7048,JERRY, Uh-oh.,116
7049,SOUP NAZI," Hey, what is this? You're kissing in my line? Nobody kisses in my line!",116
7050,SHEILA, I can kiss anywhere I want to.,116
7051,SOUP NAZI, You just cost yourself a soup!,116
7052,SHEILA," How dare you? Come on, Jerry, we're leaving. Jerry?",116
7053,JERRY, Do I know you?,116
7054,ELAINE," So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?",116
7055,JERRY, It was a bisque.,116
7056,ELAINE," Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.",116
7057,JERRY, Really?,116
7058,ELAINE," Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.",116
7059,JERRY, Have you tastes the soup?,116
7060,ELAINE, Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.,116
7061,JERRY," See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.",116
7062,JERRY, Hey.,116
7063,KRAMER, Yeah.,116
7064,ELAINE, Hey.,116
7065,KRAMER, Yeah.,116
7066,JERRY," Oh, thanks.",116
7067,ELAINE, There he is.,116
7068,KRAMER," Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.",116
7069,ELAINE," Yeah. I know. Me, too.",116
7070,JERRY," So, did these thieves want any money?",116
7071,KRAMER, No.,116
7072,JERRY, They just wanted the armoire?,116
7073,KRAMER, Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.,116
7074,JERRY, Yeah?,116
7075,GEORGE, Hup! Hup!,116
7076,JERRY," Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?",116
7077,ELAINE, No. In what way?,116
7078,JERRY," I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.",116
7079,ELAINE, I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.,116
7080,GEORGE, Hello.,116
7081,JERRY, Hello.,116
7082,KRAMER, Hey.,116
7083,GEORGE, Hello.,116
7084,ELAINE, Hello.,116
7085,GEORGE, Were you just talking about me? What's going on?,116
7086,JERRY, Absolutely not.,116
7087,GEORGE, Something's going on here.,116
7088,KRAMER," All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.",116
7089,ELAINE, One of these days that guy is gonna get his.,116
7090,GEORGE," So, how was the movie?",116
7091,JERRY," Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.",116
7092,GEORGE," Oh, yeah?",116
7093,JERRY," Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?",116
7094,GEORGE, Happy? Why should I be happy?,116
7095,JERRY," I don't know, but you look like you're happy.",116
7096,GEORGE, Why should I care?,116
7097,JERRY," You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.",116
7098,GEORGE," All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?",116
7099,JERRY, Is that so?,116
7100,GEORGE," Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!",116
7101,JERRY, Disgusting?,116
7102,GEORGE, People who do that should be arrested.,116
7103,JERRY," Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.",116
7104,GEORGE," Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.",116
7105,JERRY, What?,116
7106,GEORGE, You shook my hand in that coffee shop.,116
7107,JERRY, You're still with the pact?,116
7108,GEORGE, Mmm-hmm. You reneged.,116
7109,JERRY, All I did was shake your hand.,116
7110,GEORGE, Ah-ha!,116
7111,KRAMER," And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.",116
7112,SOUP NAZI, Ohh! This city.,116
7113,NEWMAN," One large jambalaya, please.",116
7114,SOUP NAZI," So, continue.",116
7115,KRAMER," Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.",116
7116,NEWMAN, Thank you. [inhaling deeply] Jambalaya!,116
7117,SOUP NAZI," All right, now listen to me. You have been a good friend. I have an armoire in my basement. If you want to pick it up, you're welcome to it. So, take it, it's yours.",116
7118,KRAMER, How can I possibly thank you?,116
7119,SOUP NAZI, You are the only one who understands me.,116
7120,KRAMER, You suffer for your soup.,116
7121,SOUP NAZI, Yes. That is right.,116
7122,KRAMER," You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.",116
7123,SOUP NAZI, How can I tolerate any less from my customer?,116
7124,CUSTOMER," Uh, gazpacho, por favor.",116
7125,SOUP NAZI, Por favor?,116
7126,CUSTOMER," Um, I'm part Spanish.",116
7127,SOUP NAZI, Adios muchacho!,116
7128,KRAMER, Git.,116
7129,JERRY, It was stupid of me.,116
7130,SHEILA," Well, it was very insulting.",116
7131,JERRY, No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.,116
7132,SHEILA," Well, behind every joke there's some truth.",116
7133,JERRY," What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says "" Aw, I'll just have some coffee."" There's no truth to that.",116
7134,SHEILA," Well, I guess you're right.",116
7135,JERRY," So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?",116
7136,SHEILA," Yes, shmoopy.",116
7137,JERRY, Aw!,116
7138,SUSAN," Hey, Jerry!",116
7139,JERRY," Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.",116
7140,GEORGE," Oh, yes. Hello.",116
7141,SHEILA, Hello. Won't you join us?,116
7142,GEORGE," No, thanks.",116
7143,SUSAN, Of course.,116
7144,GEORGE," Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?",116
7145,JERRY, Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?,116
7146,GEORGE," I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.",116
7147,JERRY," Well, we're changing the rules.",116
7148,GEORGE, Ahh. Good for you.,116
7149,SUSAN," Aw, what are you getting George?",116
7150,GEORGE," I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?",116
7151,SUSAN," Oh, George, you're so sweet.",116
7152,GEORGE," Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.",116
7153,SUSAN, Aww!,116
7154,JERRY," What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?",116
7155,SHEILA, Yeah.,116
7156,JERRY, Yum yum little tuna fishy?,116
7157,GEORGE, Come here.,116
7158,KRAMER, And..voila!,116
7159,ELAINE, [gasps],116
7160,KRAMER, Yeah.,116
7161,ELAINE," Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!",116
7162,KRAMER, Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?,116
7163,ELAINE, The K Man did it!,116
7164,KRAMER, Yeah!,116
7165,ELAINE, [laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?,116
7166,KRAMER, How 'bout zero?,116
7167,ELAINE, What?,116
7168,KRAMER, Yeah.,116
7169,ELAINE, What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?,116
7170,KRAMER, I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.,116
7171,ELAINE, Get out!,116
7172,ELAINE, The Soup Nazi gave it to you?,116
7173,KRAMER, Yeah.,116
7174,ELAINE, Why?,116
7175,KRAMER," Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.",116
7176,ELAINE, [gasps],116
7177,KRAMER," Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....",116
7178,ELAINE," Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!",116
7179,KRAMER," Yeah. Well, he's a dear.",116
7180,GEORGE, How much tip do you leave on $8.15?,116
7181,SUSAN," You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.",116
7182,GEORGE, Huh?,116
7183,SUSAN, [in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?,116
7184,CUSTOMER, How is he today?,116
7185,BANIA, I think he's in a good mood.,116
7186,ELAINE," Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.",116
7187,SOUP NAZI," You? If I knew it was for you, I never would have given it to him in the first place! I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it to pieces! Now, who wants soup? Next! Speak up!",116
7188,JERRY, I'm heading over to Elaine's.,116
7189,KRAMER," Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.",116
7190,JERRY, Those two?,116
7191,KRAMER, Yeah.,116
7192,JERRY, Are you sure?,116
7193,KRAMER, Yeah. That's them.,116
7194,JERRY," Well, let's confront 'em.",116
7195,KRAMER, No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.,116
7196,JERRY, There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.,116
7197,KRAMER, No!,116
7198,JERRY, Let's go.,116
7199,BOB," Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one.",116
7200,RAY," Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.",116
7201,BOB," Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.",116
7202,KRAMER, Excuse me.,116
7203,RAY, Are you talking to me?,116
7204,KRAMER," Uh, well, uh, we --",116
7205,RAY," I said, are you talking to me?",116
7206,BOB," Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?!",116
7207,KRAMER," Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?",116
7208,ELAINE," I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?",116
7209,JERRY," I don't know. "" 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley...""",116
7210,ELAINE," Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!",116
7211,JERY, So?,116
7212,ELAINE," So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.",116
7213,JERRY," Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?",116
7214,ELAINE, What do you care?,116
7215,JERRY," Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.",116
7216,ELAINE," Get out of my way, Jerry.",116
7217,JERRY," Elaine, let the man make his soup!",116
7218,ELAINE," Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.",116
7219,SUSAN," Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?",116
7220,GEORGE," Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.",116
7221,JERRY, Well. Well.,116
7222,SUSAN," Hi, Jerry.",116
7223,JERRY," Hey, Susan, George.",116
7224,SUSAN," You know, I really like Sheila a lot.",116
7225,JERRY," Oh, really?",116
7226,SUSAN, Mmm-hmm.,116
7227,JERRY, Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.,116
7228,SUSAN," Oh, no! That's too bad.",116
7229,JERRY," Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.",116
7230,GEORGE, Really?,116
7231,JERRY," Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.",116
7232,SUSAN, Mmm-hmm.,116
7233,GEORGE, You did?,116
7234,JERRY," Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.",116
7235,GEORGE, Yeah. See ya.,116
7236,SOUP NAZI, Go on! Leave! Get out!,116
7237,WOMAN, But I didn't do anything.,116
7238,SOUP NAZI, Next!,116
7239,ELAINE, Hello.,116
7240,SOUP NAZI, You. You think you can get soup? Please. You're wasting everyone's time.,116
7241,ELAINE," I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. "" 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery.""",116
7242,SOUP NAZI, That is my recipe for wild mushroom.,116
7243,ELAINE," Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.",116
7244,SOUP NAZI, Mulliga...tawny?,116
7245,ELAINE, You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!,116
7246,NEWMAN, [panting] Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!,116
7247,JERRY, What is it?,116
7248,NEWMAN, Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!,116
7249,JERRY, Wha - wha - what's the matter?,116
7250,NEWMAN," Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!",116
7251,JERRY," Well, where are you going?",116
7252,NEWMAN, He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!,116
7253,SUSAN," Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM.",117
7254,GEORGE," Yeah, I better grab some too.",117
7255,SUSAN, I'll get it for you; just give me your card.,117
7256,GEORGE, You sure?,117
7257,SUSAN," Yeah, just tell me your code.",117
7258,GEORGE, My code?,117
7259,JERRY, So why didn't you tell her the code?,117
7260,GEORGE, No. No way.,117
7261,JERRY," George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.",117
7262,GEORGE," It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'",117
7263,JERRY, So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?,117
7264,GEORGE, Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?,117
7265,JERRY," Actually, that's the definition of selfish.",117
7266,GEORGE, Have you ever given your code to anyone?,117
7267,JERRY, No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.',117
7268,GEORGE, Superman's father on Krypton.,117
7269,JERRY," Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.",117
7270,GEORGE, No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.,117
7271,JERRY, What if my life depended on it?,117
7272,GEORGE," If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.",117
7273,GEORGE, What's the matter with your leg?,117
7274,JERRY, My foot fell asleep.,117
7275,GEORGE, How'd your foot fall asleep?,117
7276,JERRY," I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.",117
7277,FRED, Hey Jerry.,117
7278,JERRY, Hey Fred.,117
7279,GEORGE, Hey Fred.,117
7280,JERRY, My foot fell asleep.,117
7281,FRED," You're lucky, at least you got something to do.",117
7282,JERRY," Fred, do you know Elaine?",117
7283,FRED," No, it's nice to meet you. Well, I'm outta here, see you guys.",117
7284,GEORGE," Alright, bye.",117
7285,JERRY, Seeya.,117
7286,ELAINE," Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'",117
7287,JERRY, So?,117
7288,ELAINE," So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.",117
7289,JERRY, And he didn't remember you?,117
7290,JERRY," Where are you going, you just got here?",117
7291,ELAINE, I gotta go talk to him.,117
7292,ELAINE," Excuse me, excuse me, Fred?",117
7293,FRED, Yeah?,117
7294,ELAINE," You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.",117
7295,FRED, We have?,117
7296,ELAINE," Yeah, at Katie Ash's party?",117
7297,FRED, What was your name again?,117
7298,ELAINE, Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?,117
7299,FRED, Not ringing a bell.,117
7300,ELAINE," When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?",117
7301,FRED," Mmm, no.",117
7302,ELAINE, That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.,117
7303,FRED," The bathroom door. I remember someone had played tic-tac-toe on it, and the X's won; they went diagonally from the top left to the bottom right.",117
7304,JERRY," Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.",117
7305,JERRY," Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.",117

7309,JERRY," Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.",117
7310,KRAMER," When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.",117
7311,JERRY, You're lucky they let you drive a car.,117
7312,KRAMER," No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.",117
7313,ELAINE, What was that?,117
7314,JERRY,  Eh.,117
7315,ELAINE," Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.",117
7316,JERRY," Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.",117

7329,SUSAN," I want you to tell me, George.",117
7330,GEORGE, Why? Why is my code so important?,117
7331,SUSAN," Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another.",117
7332,GEORGE, Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.,117
7333,SUSAN, My cycles?,117

7343,EMPLOYEE, That is a great impression!,117
7344,JERRY," Larry, wait, you don't understand!",117
7345,KRAMER," I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?",117
7346,JERRY," I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.",117
7347,KRAMER," Oh, oh your foot fell asleep.",117
7348,JERRY," Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.",117
7349,KRAMER," Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?",117
7350,JERRY, Yup.,117

7353,JERRY," Wow, the whole building burned down.",117
7354,KRAMER, They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?,117
7355,JERRY, Of course.,117
7356,KRAMER," It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.",117

7360,GEORGE, Peterman? Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman.,117
7361,JERRY," Of course not, if I did would you have gone?",117
7362,GEORGE, No way.,117
7363,JERRY, There you go.,117
7364,GEORGE," I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.",117
7365,JERRY," Trust me, you're off.",117
7366,ELAINE," Oh, hi Fred.",117
7367,FRED," Um, hello?",117

7369,FRED," Oh yeah, yeah, right.",117
7370,ELAINE, How ya doin'?,117

7378,ELAINE, Hmm. Tonight.,117
7379,FRED," What, you have other plans?",117
7380,ELAINE," No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.",117
7381,JERRY," ...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.",117
7382,GEORGE, Call the Embassy.,117
7383,JERRY, They're closed.,117
7384,GEORGE, Why?,117
7385,JERRY, Bomb threat.,117
7386,GEORGE, We're in Turkey?,117
7387,JERRY," Midnight Express, my friend.",117
7388,GEORGE, My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.,117

7392,GEORGE,  J. Crew.,117
7393,JERRY," Well, is Elaine here?",117

7395,GEORGE, What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?,117
7396,JERRY, Without Elaine? What for?,117
7397,GEORGE," What, is he crazy?",117
7398,JERRY," We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.",117
7399,GEORGE," I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank.",117
7400,JERRY," George, what's the matter with you?",117
7401,GEORGE, I'm choking!,117
7402,PETERMAN," Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?",117
7403,JERRY," Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.",117
7404,PETERMAN," I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.",117
7405,ELAINE,"  I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?",117
7406,PETERMAN," ...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars.",117
7407,GEORGE, Howbout sports? Do you follow sports?,117
7408,TV ANNOUNCER, It's fourth and inches and the Giants are going for it! You gotta love sports!,117
7409,GEORGE," You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.",117
7410,PETERMAN," Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.",117
7411,PETERMAN," Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there.  It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make it there in time.",117
7412,JERRY, I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.,117
7413,ELAINE," Well, Fred asked me out.",117
7414,JERRY, Fred?,117
7415,ELAINE," Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.",117
7416,JERRY, You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.,117
7417,ELAINE, I am? But that's so sick.,117
7418,JERRY, That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.,117
7419,ELAINE," Anyway, so how was the dinner?",117
7420,JERRY," Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.",117
7421,ELAINE, What about Georgie?,117
7422,JERRY," Nah, he didn't make it.",117
7423,PETERMAN," Doctor, how is she?",117
7424,DOCTOR, She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.,117
7425,PETERMAN," Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.",117
7426,GEORGE," I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.",117
7427,PETERMAN," Shake off the dew, my friend.",117
7428,GEORGE, Yeah. What time is it?,117
7429,PETERMAN," It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?",117
7430,GEORGE, Who?,117
7431,PETERMAN," Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it helps.",117
7432,GEORGE," Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fiancé, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!",117
7433,MRS. PETERMAN, Bosco. Bosco.,117
7434,GEORGE," Oh, shhh.",117
7435,MRS. PETERMAN,  Bosco!,117
7436,MRS. PETERMAN, Bosco! Bosco! Bosco!,117
7437,GEORGE, Shut up! Shut up!,117
7438,PETERMAN, Momma! What are you trying to say?,117
7439,MRS. PETERMAN, Bosco.,117
7440,PETERMAN, She's gone. Bosco?,117
7441,GEORGE, You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.,117
7442,JERRY, I did not bail out on you.,117
7443,GEORGE, Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?,117
7444,JERRY, Why didn't you come up with your own?,117
7445,GEORGE, I froze. I think I'm losing it.,117
7446,JERRY," Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?",117
7447,GEORGE," No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.",117
7448,GEORGE, Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.,117
7449,JERRY," Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?",117
7450,GEORGE, I am not giving you my code.,117
7451,KRAMER, I'll bet I can guess it.,117
7452,GEORGE, Pssh. Yeah. Right.,117
7453,KRAMER," Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?",117
7454,GEORGE, Huh?,117
7455,KRAMER," You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.",117
7456,GEORGE, Get out of here.,117
7457,KRAMER," Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.",117
7458,GEORGE, I'm leaving.,117
7459,KRAMER,"  No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!",117
7460,GEORGE, I gotta go.,117
7461,KRAMER, If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!,117
7462,GEORGE, Shut up!,117
7463,KRAMER, Nestlé's Quik!,117
7464,GEORGE, Shut up!,117
7465,GEORGE, What was that?,117
7466,ELAINE, What?,117
7467,GEORGE, You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?,117
7468,ELAINE, I got a date.,117
7469,ELAINE," Oh, Mr. Peterman.",117
7470,PETERMAN," Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.",117
7471,GEORGE, Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.,117
7472,ELAINE," Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.",117
7473,PETERMAN, You do?,117
7474,GEORGE," Uh, yes, actually we-we both do.",117
7475,ELAINE, I have a personal commitment.,117
7476,GEORGE," Well, personal, I mean, we both uh...",117
7477,PETERMAN, What is it?,117

7479,GEORGE," Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.",117
7480,PETERMAN," I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.",117
7481,ELAINE, My pleasure.,117
7482,PETERMAN," Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this.",117
7483,PETERMAN," You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.",117
7484,KRAMER," Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?",117
7485,JERRY, Fire station?,117
7486,KRAMER," Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!",117

7488,KRAMER," Oh, so he took you back.",117
7489,JERRY," Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.",117
7490,KRAMER," Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.",117
7491,JERRY, No I didn't.,117
7492,CAPTAIN," Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of short cuts is most impressive.",117
7493,KRAMER," Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.",117
7494,CAPTAIN," Mr. Kramer, just about every week some brash young hothead like yourself saunters in here talking about faster routes and snazzier colors for the trucks, well, fact is we feel things are fine the way they are.",117
7495,JERRY," Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.",117

7501,KRAMER," Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?",117
7502,KRAMER," Well, you'd better take it easy.",117
7503,FRED," Sorry about the other night but my mother called, she couldn't find her pills. I had to go into Brooklyn to help her find her pills, and they were right there in the medicine cabinet. Could you believe that?",117
7504,ELAINE, Huh.,117
7505,FRED, The worst part is getting from the subway station to the house. There's no transportation...,117
7506,ELAINE,"  What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...",117
7507,FRED," ...I could have taken a cab but if my mother saw me pull up in a cab, she'd start yelling at me, ""Freddy! What are taking a cab for? It's so expensive!"" She's out of her mind. Eventually, you'll meet her.",117

7517,CAPTAIN," Kramer, get the hell off of there. You're not trained to operate this equipment!",117
7518,MAN ON THE STREET," Hey, Kramer!",117
7519,CAPTAIN," What are you doing, Kramer?! You're all over the road!",117
7520,KRAMER," Don't worry, Cap, I can handle it!",117

7545,JERRY,"I’d like to know when Tic-Tac-Toe became the Pound sign, that's what I’d like to know. Why don't they call it what it really is -- “Leave your numeric message now and then press Archie’s head.” And what is that redial button? Let's face it -- you're either going to get the person, the machine or they have call waiting. Who is redialing and redialing? This is like the harassment key for people in a fight, you know.																										“Hey I’m not through --” CLICK. Blulululululu.													“You can't do that to me --” CLICK. Blulululululu.													“And another thing --” CLICK. Blulululululu.",118

7548,GEORGE," Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?",118
7549,JERRY, Well I think that's pretty obvious.,118
7550,GEORGE, Yeah. Me too.,118
7551,JERRY, Hey Elaine.,118

7890,JERRY,"I have a friend, wears eyeglasses, no prescription in the glasses because he thinks it makes him look more intelligent, now why? Why do we think that glasses makes us look more intelligent? Is it from the endless hours of reading and studying and researching that this person supposedly blew out their eyeballs, and that's why they need the glasses? It's just a corrective device. If you see someone with a hearing aid, you don't think, 'Oh, they must have been listening real good...yeah, to a lot of important stuff...' No, they are deaf . They can't hear.",119
7891,KRAMER," Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.",119

7912,ELAINE, You're buying a speedboat?,119

7914,ELAINE, I don't know about that.,119
7915,JERRY," So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?",119

7935,SUSAN, What are you talking about?,119
7936,GEORGE, He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.,119

That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go ""isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one.

8096,KRAMER," I said "" Jump."" Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said "" Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me."" At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something. ",12

8115,VIC, I'll have to charge you for another machine. ,12
8116,JERRY," Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across. ",12

8130,GEORGE, Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible. ,12
8131,JERRY, So what are you gonna do? ,12
8132,GEORGE, I like sports. I could do something in sports. ,12
8133,JERRY, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity? ,12
8134,GEORGE," You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something. ",12
8135,JERRY," Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get. ",12
8136,GEORGE," Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game. ",12
8137,JERRY, Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments. ,12
8138,GEORGE, What about that? ,12
8139,JERRY," Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting. ",12

8147,JERRY, But you gotta know how to work the projector. ,12
8148,GEORGE, Right. ,12
8149,JERRY, And it's probably a union thing. ,12
8150,GEORGE,"  Those unions.  Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host? ",12
8151,JERRY, Talk show host. That's good. ,12
8152,GEORGE, I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host. ,12
8153,JERRY, Really? ,12
8154,GEORGE," Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start? ",12
8155,JERRY," Well, that's where it gets tricky. ",12
8156,GEORGE," You can't just walk into a building and say "" I wanna be a talk show host."" ",12
8157,JERRY, I wouldn't think so. ,12
8158,GEORGE, It's all politics. ,12
8159,JERRY," All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else? ",12
8160,GEORGE, This could have been a huge mistake. ,12
8161,JERRY," Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through. ",12
8162,GEORGE,  Guess not. What should I do? ,12
8163,JERRY, Maybe you can just go back. ,12
8164,GEORGE, Go back? ,12
8165,JERRY, Yeah. Pretend like it never happened. ,12
8166,GEORGE, You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened? ,12
8167,JERRY, Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously. ,12
8168,GEORGE, Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened. ,12
8169,JERRY, Never happened. ,12
8170,GEORGE, I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what? ,12
8171,JERRY, So what? You're entitled. ,12
8172,GEORGE, I'm emotional. ,12
8173,JERRY, That's right. You're emotional. ,12
8174,GEORGE, Never happened. ,12
8175,JERRY, Never happened. ,12
8176,JERRY," To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in ""morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine"" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, ""How ya doin'?"" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow ""Hey"" You start coming up with nicknames for them. ""Jimbo.""",12
8177,GEORGE, How ya doin'? ,12
8178,GLENDA, What are you doing here? ,12
8179,GEORGE, What? I work here. ,12
8180,GLENDA, I thought you quit. ,12
8181,GEORGE, What quit?  Who quit? ,12
8182,DAN," Bill, how was your weekend? ",12
8183,BILL," Oh, excellent weekend. What about your weekend? ",12
8184,DAN, Fine weekend. ,12
8185,GEORGE, Yeah. Good weekend. ,12
8186,DAN," Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing.  Lisa was a little scared at first, but that kids' gonna be a good sailor someday. ",12
8187,GEORGE," Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor. ",12
8188,LEVITAN," Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon? ",12
8189,AVA," Oh, I got a little tied up. ",12
8190,LEVITAN, I'll bet you did. ,12
8191,LEVITAN," I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party for Rick Barr Properties is gonna be Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock in Lasky's Bar, on Madison 48th. I want all of you to be there. This really means a lot to me. Is that Costanza over there? What are you doing here? ",12
8192,GEORGE, What? ,12
8193,LEVITAN," Am I crazy, or didn't you quit? ",12
8194,GEORGE, When? ,12
8195,LEVITAN, Friday. ,12
8196,GEORGE," Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously? ",12
8197,LEVITAN," You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff? ",12
8198,GEORGE, Come on. Will you stop it. ,12
8199,LEVITAN, No brains? No ability? ,12
8200,GEORGE, Teasing. ,12
8201,LEVITAN, Okay. I want you outta here. ,12
8202,GEORGE," I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh,  you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?",12
8203,DAN, I wouldn't say all the time.,12
8204,LEVITAN, You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're there. Because I'm a winner. I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser. ,12
8205,GEORGE," "" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser."" This is what he said to me. ",12
8206,JERRY," Well, so that's that. ",12
8207,GEORGE, No. That's not that. ,12
8208,JERRY, That's not that? ,12
8209,GEORGE, No. ,12
8210,JERRY," Well, if that's not that, what is that? ",12
8211,GEORGE, I've got some plans. I got plans. ,12
8212,JERRY, What kind of plans? ,12
8213,GEORGE, What's the difference? ,12
8214,JERRY, You don't wanna tell me? ,12
8215,GEORGE, I'm gonna slip him a mickey. ,12
8216,JERRY, What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre? ,12
8217,GEORGE, You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing. ,12
8218,JERRY, What if you destroy him? ,12
8219,GEORGE, No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over. ,12
8220,JERRY," Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal. ",12
8221,GEORGE, This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey! ,12
8222,JERRY, You've really gone mental. ,12
8223,GEORGE, Nah. ,12
8224,JERRY," Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying ""mickey""! ",12
8225,GEORGE, I got a source. ,12
8226,JERRY, You got a mickey source? ,12
8227,GEORGE, And Elaine is gonna keep him busy. ,12
8228,JERRY, Elaine? How did you rope her into this? ,12
8229,GEORGE, I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife. ,12
8230,JERRY, She knew that. ,12
8231,GEORGE, But she didn't know he doesn't recycle. ,12
8232,JERRY, What is the point of all this? ,12
8233,GEORGE, Revenge. ,12
8234,JERRY," Oh, the best revenge is living well. ",12
8235,GEORGE, There's no chance of that. ,12
8236,JERRY, Did you get your laundry? ,12
8237,KRAMER, Yeah. ,12
8238,JERRY, What's with you? ,12
8239,KRAMER, He jumped. ,12
8240,JERRY, What? ,12
8241,KRAMER, Yeah. Newman jumped. ,12
8242,JERRY, Did he call you last night? ,12
8243,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. ",12
8244,JERRY, What did you say? ,12
8245,KRAMER," I said "" Wave to me when you pass my window."" ",12
8246,JERRY, Whew. Did he wave? ,12
8247,KRAMER," No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me. ",12
8248,JERRY,"  Oh, my god! ",12
8249,KRAMER, What's the matter? ,12
8250,JERRY,"  Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go. ",12
8251,KRAMER, Where? Where? ,12
8252,JERRY, To the Laundromat. ,12
8253,VIC, I never saw it. ,12
8254,KRAMER, Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing? ,12
8255,VIC," Hey, you see that sign right there? (Points to a sign saying ""Not Responsible for Valuables""",12
8256,JERRY," Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society. ",12
8257,VIC," Yea that's right, 'cuz this place is my country and I'm the president, and that's my constitution. I'm not responsible. ",12
8258,JERRY," So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry? ",12
8259,VIC, You ever hear of a bank? ,12
8260,JERRY, Come on. Let's go. ,12
8261,KRAMER, No. You can't let him get away with this. ,12
8262,ELAINE, Which one is he? ,12
8263,GEORGE, That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish. ,12
8264,ELAINE," Oh, yeah. I see him. ",12
8265,GEORGE," Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this. ",12
8266,ELAINE, Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison? ,12
8267,GEORGE, This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done. ,12
8268,ELAINE, Yeah. It is kind of cool. ,12
8269,GEORGE, First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone. ,12
8270,ELAINE, I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies. ,12
8271,GEORGE, That's exactly what I told Jerry! ,12
8272,ELAINE, Really? ,12
8273,GEORGE," Yes!  God, I've never felt so alive! ",12
8274,JERRY, Maybe we should call this off. ,12
8275,KRAMER, Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine. ,12
8276,JERRY, And what's gonna happen? ,12
8277,KRAMER," Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block! ",12
8278,JERRY, If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor. ,12
8279,KRAMER, You keep him busy. ,12
8280,KRAMER, Whoa! ,12
8281,GEORGE, You go over there - ,12
8282,ELAINE, Yeah. ,12
8283,GEORGE," You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink. ",12
8284,ELAINE, Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth? ,12
8285,LEVITAN, Come on! They're terrible. They got no infield. ,12
8286,ELAINE, Oops!  'Scuse me. ,12
8287,LEVITAN, Yeah. ,12
8288,GREENY, I'm gonna get some food. You want some? ,12
8289,LEVITAN, Nah. ,12
8290,ELAINE, Hi. ,12
8291,LEVITAN, Hi. ,12
8292,ELAINE,  ,12
8293,LEVITAN, God bless you. ,12
8294,ELAINE," Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much.  Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou! ",12
8295,LEVITAN,  You're welcome. ,12
8296,ELAINE," People don't say "" God bless you "" as much as they used to. Have you noticed that? ",12
8297,LEVITAN, No. ,12
8298,ELAINE,"  So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week. ",12
8299,LEVITAN,  Nudist colony? ,12
8300,ELAINE," Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah! ",12
8301,LEVITAN,  I'd never been to a nudist colony. ,12
8302,ELAINE," Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked. ",12
8303,LEVITAN, Seriously? ,12
8304,ELAINE," Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day. ",12
8305,GEORGE,"  Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat? ",12
8306,GLENDA,  What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats. ,12
8307,GEORGE,  I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here. ,12
8308,GLENDA,  What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired. ,12
8309,GEORGE,  Okay. Okay. Fine. ,12
8310,ELAINE," I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked. ",12
8311,LEVITAN, Who are you? ,12
8312,ELAINE," Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble. ",12
8313,JERRY,  What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that? ,12
8314,JERRY, Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle? ,12
8315,JERRY, What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament? ,12
8316,JERRY, What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks? ,12
8317,KRAMER, I didn't realize it was a full box. ,12
8318,GEORGE,"  I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off. ",12
8319,GLENDA, I don't' wear a wig. ,12
8320,GEORGE, One... ,12
8321,ELAINE," No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around. ",12
8322,ELAINE, I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra. ,12
8323,GEORGE," Hello, Rick. ",12
8324,LEVITAN, Heh heh heh hey! Look who's here! ,12
8325,GEORGE," That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me! ",12
8326,LEVITAN," You know something, Costanza? I'm a very lucky man. ",12
8327,GEORGE, Oh! ,12
8328,LEVITAN, I've always been lucky. Things just seem to fall right in my lap. ,12
8329,GEORGE, Boom! ,12
8330,LEVITAN," You wouldn't believe it if I told you. In fact, uh, I'm glad you're here. You know, maybe I've been a little rough on ya, huh? ",12
8331,GEORGE, Oh. ,12
8332,LEVITAN," Why should we let petty, personal differences get in the way of business? I, uh, I want you to come back.  You can use my bathroom anytime you want. ",12
8333,GEORGE, You want me to come back? Uh... ,12
8334,LEVITAN," Hey! How about a toast, huh? Everybody, a toast! ",12
8335,GEORGE, Rick. ,12
8336,LEVITAN," Everyone, I wanna propose a toast to ten great years at Rick Barr Properties. ",12
8337,GEORGE," Uh, Rick.. ",12
8338,LEVITAN," And all the people in this room,  that made that possible.. ",12
8339,GEORGE, Rick. ,12
8340,LEVITAN," I'd also like to welcome back into the fold our..our little shrimpy friend, George Costanza who, although he didn't really have a very good year -- how you blew that McConnell deal, I'll never know. But, hey, what the hell, huh? We've always enjoyed his antics around the office. Heh heh. Anything you wanna add to this? ",12
8341,GEORGE, Drink up. ,12
8342,GEORGE," I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something. ",12
8343,ELAINE," Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree. ",12
8344,JERRY, Yeah. That's true. ,12
8345,KRAMER,  Oh.,12
8346,JERRY," What?  My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it? ",12
8347,KRAMER, It was in my laundry. ,12
8348,JERRY, In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be? ,12
8349,KRAMER, It was about 1200 bucks. ,12
8350,NEWMAN, Kramer! ,12
8351,KRAMER, Oh! That's Newman. ,12
8352,NEWMAN, I'm on the roof! ,12
8353,KRAMER,"  Well, what are you waiting for? ",12
8354,JERRY," Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money.. ",12
8355,GEORGE,  I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy. ,12
8356,KRAMER, You wanna shoot some pool tonight? ,12
8357,NEWMAN, I can't. I'm goin' to a movie. ,12
8358,GEORGE,  Nah. It's probably a union thing. ,12
8359,JERRY," People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'",12
8360,JERRY," I think gum is, is one of the weirdest human inventions.  It's not a liquid, 's not a solid, 's not a food. What is it? It isn't really anything, you know. I mean, it's like a stationary bike for your jaw. Like, remember when you were in school, and teachers would get all riled up if they caught you with gum? And when you were a kid, you'd think 'What is the big deal?' But, as an adult, I can understand it, because when you're chewing gum, you don't look like you're too thrilled with anything anyone has to say.  'Oh, World War Two. That was an important historical event? Yeah, I'm sure.' 'They landed a man on the moon, nineteen sixty-nine? Yeah, right. Yeah, I buy that, teach.'",120
8361,GEORGE, You think she's happy?,120
8362,JERRY, Who?,120
8363,GEORGE,  The cashier.,120
8364,JERRY, Ruthie Cohen?,120
8365,GEORGE,  You know her name?,120
8366,JERRY, Sure.,120
8367,GEORGE, I don't think I've ever spoken to her.,120
8368,JERRY, Maybe that's why she's happy.,120
8369,KRAMER,"  Good morning, gentlemen.",120
8370,JERRY, What is this?,120
8371,KRAMER,"  Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.",120
8372,JERRY, That stinky old movie-house?,120
8373,KRAMER,"  Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.",120
8374,GEORGE,  With Spartacus?,120
8375,KRAMER,"  Well, it's a rare archival print.  Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.",120
8376,JERRY, Geoffrey who?,120
8377,KRAMER," Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.",120
8378,GEORGE, Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?,120
8379,KRAMER," Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill?  Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.",120
8380,GEORGE, Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?,120
8381,KRAMER," Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.",120
8382,JERRY, I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.,120
8383,KRAMER," Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.",120
8384,GEORGE, Really?,120
8385,KRAMER," Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.",120
8386,JERRY," Oh, then I'm not worried.",120
8387,KRAMER," But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.",120
8388,GEORGE,"  Breakdown, huh?",120
8389,LLOYD, Hey Kramer.,120
8390,KRAMER," Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. ",120
8391,LLOYD, How you doing?,120
8392,KRAMER,  Sit down. ,120
8393,LLOYD, Hi Jerry.,120
8394,JERRY, Lloyd.,120
8395,LLOYD, George.,120
8396,GEORGE," Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?",120
8397,KRAMER," Yeah well, he's doing fine, George.",120
8398,LLOYD,  Gum?,120
8399,JERRY,  That's an interesting package.,120
8400,LLOYD," Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted.",120
8401,KRAMER," Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. ",120
8402,LLOYD, George?,120
8403,GEORGE, I don't chew gum.,120
8404,JERRY,"  Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?",120
8405,LLOYD, Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.,120
8406,JERRY," Nah, don't bother.",120
8407,LLOYD," No, it's no problem.",120
8408,JERRY, I don't want it.,120
8409,KRAMER," Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.",120
8410,JERRY, Alright.,120
8411,KRAMER," Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm.",120
8412,GEORGE, You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.,120
8413,ELAINE, Hey.,120
8414,GEORGE, Hey.,120
8415,JERRY, I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. ,120
8416,ELAINE, What kind is that?,120
8417,JERRY," It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.",120
8418,ELAINE, Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?,120
8419,GEORGE,"  After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.",120
8420,ELAINE," You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?",120
8421,JERRY," You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.",120
8422,ELAINE," Yeah? Well, I got news for you.",120
8423,GEORGE," The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'",120
8424,JERRY, And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.,120
8425,GEORGE," Right, gotta get going.",120
8426,JERRY, Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?,120
8427,GEORGE," Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.",120
8428,JERRY, I thought your parents were outta town?,120
8429,GEORGE, Why d'you think I'm going now?,120
8430,POP, Georgie!,120
8431,GEORGE," Hey, Mr Lazzari.",120
8432,POP," Back in the old neighborhood, ah?",120
8433,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.",120
8434,POP," Oh, snazzy car. Le Baron?",120
8435,GEORGE," Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.",120
8436,POP," The actor, right?",120
8437,GEORGE, Something like that.,120
8438,POP, Mind if I look under the hood?,120
8439,GEORGE," Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.",120
8440,POP," Oh, Deena! Deena, Deena, l... look who's here.",120
8441,DEENA," George Costanza, is that you?",120
8442,GEORGE," Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug.  Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.",120
8443,DEENA," Boy, those were some crazy times.",120
8444,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?",120
8445,KRAMER," The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.",120
8446,ELAINE," Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?",120
8447,KRAMER," Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.",120
8448,JERRY," Oh, can Lloyd really do that?",120
8449,KRAMER," Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry.  And you should say hello to him, Elaine.",120
8450,ELAINE,  What? Lloyd is here?,120
8451,ELAINE," What? No, no, I'd rather...",120
8452,LLOYD, Hi Elaine.,120
8453,ELAINE,"  Lloyd, yes. Hello.",120
8454,LLOYD," Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit together.",120
8455,ELAINE,"  Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm,  because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards.",120
8456,LLOYD," That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?",120
8457,KRAMER,"  You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all.  Not crazy.",120
8458,JERRY, We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?,120
8459,ELAINE," I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.",120
8460,JERRY," Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.",120
8461,DEENA, Poor Lloyd.,120
8462,GEORGE, I know. Completely bonkers!,120
8463,DEENA," Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after what happened to Pop.",120
8464,GEORGE, Pop? What happened to Pop?,120
8465,DEENA, I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm taking care of him.,120
8466,POP," Oh, I tell you, they don't build 'em like this any more.",120
8467,GEORGE,"  He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?",120
8468,DEENA," Uhn, it was too much for him.",120
8469,GEORGE,"  Uhm, I, I gotta go.",120
8470,DEENA, What?,120
8471,GEORGE," I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.",120
8472,GEORGE, Pop! POP!!,120
8473,LLOYD," 's a great movie, huh?",120
8474,KRAMER, Yeah.,120
8475,LLOYD, Sorry you forgot those glasses.,120
8476,JERRY, I don't know what I was thinking.,120
8477,LLOYD, How'd you like that gum?,120
8478,JERRY,  Errh.,120
8479,KRAMER,"  Ah, he loved it.",120
8480,ELAINE," Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.",120
8481,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired.",120
8482,ELAINE, Oh. Oh God.,120
8483,LLOYD, You alright?,120
8484,ELAINE," Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.",120
8485,ELAINE," Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?",120
8486,COP," Lady, you sold me.  Hey, you with the hose.",120
8487,KRAMER," Yeah, put these glasses on.",120
8488,JERRY,"  Well, what's this for?",120
8489,KRAMER," Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.",120
8490,JERRY, So what?,120
8491,KRAMER," Well, he thinks you wear those.",120
8492,KRAMER, They're from the lost and found at the Alex.,120
8493,JERRY," Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.",120
8494,KRAMER," Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.",120
8495,GEORGE," 'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill,  but you only gave me change for a ten.",120
8496,CASHIER, I don't think so.,120
8497,GEORGE," Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well,  that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?",120
8498,CASHIER, Not unless you buy something.,120
8499,GEORGE," Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.",120
8500,LLOYD, Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?,120
8501,GEORGE, I don't.,120
8502,CASHIER, Take a look.,120
8503,GEORGE, I know I gave it to you.,120
8504,LLOYD," George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry.",120
8505,GEORGE,  Fine. Fine.  Excuse me.  Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!,120
8506,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry, look who's here.",120
8507,JERRY," Ah, Lloyd.",120
8508,LLOYD, Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.,120
8509,JERRY,"  Oh, the gum.",120
8510,KRAMER," Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?",120
8511,JERRY,"  Uh, alright. ",120
8512,KRAMER," Oh, boy.",120
8513,KRAMER," Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.",120
8514,JERRY," Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.",120
8515,LLOYD," Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him, you can get it whenever you want.",120
8516,JERRY, 's not necessary.,120
8517,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.",120
8518,JERRY," I know that, Kramer.",120
8519,LLOYD," Well, if you don't want to...",120
8520,KRAMER," No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?",120
8521,JERRY," Yes I do, Kramer.",120
8522,LLOYD, So...,120
8523,KRAMER, Yeah?,120
8524,LLOYD," How about that Elaine today, huh?",120
8525,KRAMER," Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?",120
8526,LLOYD,  She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.,120
8527,JERRY, I didn't see anything.,120
8528,KRAMER," Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.",120
8529,DEENA, You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again.,120
8530,GEORGE," Well, you know.  It's understandable.",120
8531,DEENA," I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown I uh, become very sensitive to the warning signs.",120
8532,GEORGE, Warning signs?,120
8533,DEENA," Nervousness, irritability, paranoia.",120
8534,GEORGE,"  What?  Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem.  Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.",120
8535,DEENA," Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others.",120
8536,GEORGE, All my friends do that.,120
8537,DEENA," George, I'm only trying to help...",120
8538,DEENA," I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?",120
8539,GEORGE, You see that woman on the horse? ,120
8540,GEORGE," She stole twenty dollars from me.  Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!",120
8541,DEENA, So again it all comes back to Lloyd.,120
8542,GEORGE,"  Hey! Hey, you!  Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!",120
8543,JERRY, So you say she was on a horse?,120
8544,GEORGE," I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.",120
8545,JERRY," Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.",120
8546,ELAINE, Hey.,120
8547,JERRY," Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.",120
8548,ELAINE,  What?,120
8549,JERRY," I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.",120
8550,ELAINE,"  Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.",120
8551,JERRY, Maybe it's in the lost and found.,120
8552,ELAINE," Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.",120
8553,JERRY," You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.",120
8554,KRAMER," Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.",120
8555,HAARWOOD," Well I, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've misplaced my spectacles.",120
8556,KRAMER," Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?",120
8557,HAARWOOD, They're half-glasses.,120
8558,KRAMER, Brown?,120
8559,HAARWOOD," Mmm, yes, yes.",120
8560,KRAMER," Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.",120
8561,HAARWOOD, Certainly.,120
8562,HAARWOOD, Oh my goodness. What a spanking button.,120
8563,GEORGE,  Alright. Alright.,120
8564,GEORGE,"  Hang on, it's warming up!",120
8565,GEORGE,  Oh you mother...,120
8566,GEORGE, Hey! What is your problem?,120
8567,GEORGE," Oh, hello, it's you!  Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars.  Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?",120
8568,CASHIER, Your car's on fire.,120
8569,GEORGE, Aah! Fire!,120
8570,CASHIER,  Merry Christmas!,120
8571,GEORGE,  Fire!!,120
8572,GEORGE, Your hose! Where's your hose?!,120
8573,FLORIST, Cop made me disconnect it.,120
8574,KRAMER," Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?",120
8575,GEORGE, The Jon Voight car is no more.,120
8576,KRAMER," Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.",120
8577,GEORGE, No kidding?,120
8578,KRAMER, No kidding.,120
8579,GEORGE," Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.",120
8580,KRAMER," Yeah, merry Christmas.",120
8581,GEORGE,  Whatever.,120
8582,JERRY," Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?",120
8583,KRAMER," What, he's not here yet?",120
8584,JERRY," Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!",120
8585,KRAMER," Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses.",120
8586,JERRY, Why?,120
8587,KRAMER, They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.,120
8588,KRAMER,"  Here, try this pair.",120
8589,JERRY," Aw, these are really strong glasses.",120
8590,LLOYD, Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?,120
8591,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah.",120
8592,KRAMER,"  Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.",120
8593,LLOYD, Anybody see Elaine today?,120
8594,KRAMER," Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.",120
8595,LLOYD," Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing, if you know what I mean.",120
8596,JERRY, Absolutely. Let's just stick around.,120
8597,LLOYD," Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog here.",120
8598,KRAMER," Uh, yeah.",120
8599,LLOYD," I'd like a hotdog, please.",120
8600,ATTENDANT, Are you outta your mind?,120
8601,KRAMER, Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?,120
8602,ATTENDANT, This hotdog's been here since the silent era. You'd have to be insane to eat it.,120
8603,KRAMER," No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.",120
8604,LLOYD," Kramer, maybe...",120
8605,KRAMER," No, no, no, no. I'll show you.  One hotdog please.",120
8606,ATTENDANT,  Okay.,120
8607,KRAMER," Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?",120
8608,KRAMER," Yeah, here we go, yeah.  Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. ",120
8609,KRAMER," Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy.  I gotta get, some air.",120
8610,ELAINE," Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?",120
8611,FLORIST, How would you happen to know that?,120
8612,ELAINE," Well, uhm... I...",120
8613,FLORIST,"  You're that lady that was talking to the cops, aren't you?",120
8614,ELAINE, Uh... I...,120
8615,VOICE ," Hey, Joe!",120
8616,ELAINE," No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!",120
8617,ELAINE, Hey. Hey everybody.,120
8618,LLOYD," Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon Jerry, let's go. Car's out front.",120
8619,JERRY, Lloyd?,120
8620,JERRY, Lloyd?,120
8621,ELAINE,  What is Lloyd's problem?,120
8622,KRAMER," Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.",120
8623,ELAINE," Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose.",120
8624,KRAMER," Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.",120
8625,DEENA," So, you want my father to pay for this?",120
8626,GEORGE, You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.,120
8627,DEENA, And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too.,120
8628,GEORGE," No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.",120
8629,DEENA, What cashier?,120
8630,GEORGE, You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.,120
8631,DEENA, To park her horse?,120
8632,GEORGE," No, she wasn't on the horse.",120
8633,DEENA," So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse?",120
8634,GEORGE, That's right.,120
8635,GEORGE,  And him!,120
8636,DEENA, The man with the flowers?,120
8637,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...",120
8638,GEORGE," I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.",120
8639,DEENA, Who?,120
8640,GEORGE, Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this.  Jerry.,120
8641,GEORGE, Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!,120
8642,GEORGE," Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're...",120
8643,DEENA,  That was your best friend?,120
8644,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.",120
8645,DEENA, That man was wearing glasses.,120
8646,GEORGE, I know. Don't you see.  He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!,120
8647,LLOYD, I'll run in and get the gum.,120
8648,JERRY, Alright.,120
8649,LLOYD, Got any money?,120
8650,JERRY,  Here.,120
8651,LLOYD,  I'll be back.,120
8652,GEORGE," Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.",120
8653,DEENA," I don't know, George. I don't know what to believe.",120
8654,GEORGE," Believe me, I am not crazy.",120
8655,DEENA," Well, I guess it's possible.",120
8656,LLOYD, Here y'go.,120
8657,JERRY,  Got all this?,120
8658,LLOYD, Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.,120
8659,JERRY,  I gave you a hundred dollars?!,120
8660,LLOYD," You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?",120
8661,JERRY, It's a lotta gum!,120
8662,KRAMER, Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses.,120
8663,HAARWOOD," Oh, splendid. Welcome to the Institute for the Preservation of Motion Picture Costumes and Wardrobe.",120
8664,KRAMER," Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W.",120
8665,HAARWOOD," Well eh, we prefer to call it the Institute.",120
8666,KRAMER, Is that from Henry the Eighth?,120
8667,HAARWOOD," Yes, yes, it is.",120
8668,KRAMER," Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?",120
8669,HAARWOOD," Well, I... I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would fit a man of your impressive, Raymond Massey-like, physique. The only person who could really fit into this costume, would have to be a short, stocky, man of somewhat generous proportions.",120
8670,KRAMER,  You don't say.,120
8671,KRAMER," You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.",120
8672,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.",120
8673,KRAMER," Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.",120
8674,GEORGE,"  Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.",120
8675,GEORGE,"  Can I get a pack of gum, please?",120
8676,GUY," I beg your pardon, your majesty, but we don't accept bills with lipstick on the president.",120
8677,GEORGE," What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that?  I guess I owe that cashier an apology.",120
8678,DEENA, Oh my God!,120
8679,GEORGE," No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.",120
8680,GEORGE, Th... this isn't mine.,120
8681,GEORGE, I got it from the Institute. The Institute.,120
8682,GEORGE,  Dee... Deena!,120
8683,KRAMER," Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.",120
8684,HAARWOOD," Well, thank you. Uh, where is your friend King Henry?",120
8685,KRAMER," Oh, he ran away.",120
8686,LLOYD, Hey Kramer.,120
8687,KRAMER, I need to talk to you.,120
8688,ELAINE," You know, that button looks very familiar.",120
8689,HAARWOOD," Yes, it, it, it's antique ivory.",120
8690,ELAINE," I, I think that's my button.  You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?",120
8691,HAARWOOD," Yes, it was in the lost and found.",120
8692,ELAINE, Shall I undo it?,120
8693,HAARWOOD," Oh yes, of course you can.",120
8694,ELAINE," Oh, thank you.",120
8695,HAARWOOD, I'm a little ticklish.,120
8696,ELAINE," Oh.  Tickle, tickle.",120
8697,LLOYD, We've really gotta get that Elaine a boyfriend.,120
8698,KRAMER," Oh, tell me about it.",120
8699,ELAINE,"  I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.",121
8700,ELAINE," Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.",121
8701,JERRY, Maybe he'll write a song about you.,121
8702,ELAINE, Yeah. Right.  Like that really matters.,121
8703,JERRY, So I take it he's spongeworthy?,121
8704,ELAINE," Oh, yeah.",121
8705,JERRY," Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.",121
8706,ELAINE," Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.",121
8707,JERRY," Oh, no?",121
8708,ELAINE," Yeah. In fact, he....",121
8709,JERRY, Come on. Come on.,121
8710,ELAINE, I don't wanna!,121
8711,JERRY," Elaine, you're among friends.",121
8712,ELAINE,"  Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.",121
8713,JERRY, Oh.,121
8714,ELAINE, Yeah. It's surprising.,121
8715,JERRY," Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?",121
8716,ELAINE," No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.",121
8717,JERRY, Sure. Why not? You're there.,121
8718,ELAINE, Exactly.,121
8719,JERRY," But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.",121
8720,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.",121
8721,JERRY, What stuff?,121
8722,KRAMER," I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.",121
8723,JERRY," All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.",121
8724,KRAMER, Course I will. These are staples.,121
8725,JERRY, A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?,121
8726,KRAMER," Lindsay olives, Jerry.",121
8727,JERRY, A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?,121
8728,KRAMER, $17.50. You can't beat that.,121
8729,JERRY, Look...look at this can of tuna!,121
8730,KRAMER," Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.",121
8731,JERRY, This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.,121
8732,KRAMER," Hey, Clyde!",121
8733,CLYDE," Hey, Kramer! What's happening, dude?",121
8734,KRAMER," Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here.",121
8735,CLYDE, How ya doin'?,121
8736,JERRY, Hi.,121
8737,KRAMER," You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.",121
8738,JERRY, John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.,121
8739,CLYDE, Oh yeah?,121
8740,JERRY," Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.",121
8741,CLYDE, Is that right?,121
8742,KRAMER," Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.",121
8743,CLYDE," Oh, sorry Kramer, I got to watch the hands. My hands are my life.",121
8744,ESTELLE," Georgie, can you zip me up?",121
8745,GEORGE," Yeah. Yeah, one second.",121
8746,ESTELLE," Well, come on!",121
8747,GEORGE, All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.,121
8748,ESTELLE," Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.",121
8749,GEORGE," My in-laws. Oh, my....",121
8750,FRANK," So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?",121
8751,ESTELLE, I don't like that tie.,121
8752,FRANK, What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.,121
8753,ESTELLE, It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.,121
8754,FRANK, How do you know what kind of ties they wear?,121
8755,ESTELLE, Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!,121
8756,FRANK," Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.",121
8757,ESTELLE," George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?",121
8758,FRANK, Huh?,121
8759,GEORGE, I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.,121
8760,FRANK, We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.,121
8761,ESTELLE, It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.,121
8762,FRANK, No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste!,121
8763,GEORGE, This is gonna be fun.,121
8764,JERRY," Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.",121
8765,ELAINE, So what did he have to say?,121
8766,JERRY, Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.,121
8767,ELAINE, Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?,121
8768,JERRY, Yeah.,121
8769,ELAINE, What did you do that for?,121
8770,JERRY, What?,121
8771,ELAINE, What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.,121
8772,JERRY, Oh,121
8773,ELAINE," I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.",121
8774,JERRY," Well, Clyde might not tell him.",121
8775,ELAINE, How do you know that?,121
8776,JERRY, I should have helped Kramer with those packages.,121
8777,ELAINE, Ohh!,121
8778,DENNIS," Let me give you a hand. Hey, Kramer. I wonder, could you do me a favor? I'm taking the family to Disneyworld next week. I wonder...",121
8779,KRAMER, Uh-huh.,121
8780,DENNIS," I wonder, could you pick up my mail?",121
8781,KRAMER, Yeah. Sure. Sure.,121
8782,DENNIS," In fact, you know what, how would you like to take my hansom cab for the week?",121
8783,KRAMER, Drive the horse?,121
8784,DENNIS, It'll just be sitting there. You can really clean up. 500 bucks a day. I'll split it with ya.,121
8785,KRAMER," Oh, giddyup. Yeah.",121
8786,GEORGE," This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.",121
8787,MRS. ROSS, Oh.,121
8788,MR. ROSS, What are you complimenting her for? She didn't make it Rowenna did.,121
8789,FRANK, What is this thing anyway?,121
8790,MRS. ROSS, It's Cornish gamehen.,121
8791,FRANK," What is that, like a little chicken?",121
8792,GEORGE," It's, uh, it's not a little chicken.  Little chicken. It's a gamebird.",121
8793,FRANK, Gamebird?,121
8794,GEORGE, Yeah.,121
8795,FRANK," What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?",121
8796,MR. ROSS, Yes.,121
8797,FRANK, How hard could it be to kill this thing?,121
8798,ESTELLE, I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.,121
8799,MRS. ROSS," If I had a dime for every book he's actually read,  I'd be broke.",121
8800,SUSAN, More wine anyone?,121
8801,FRANK, Yeah. I'll take some.,121
8802,SUSAN, Hmmm?,121
8803,FRANK, Thank you.,121
8804,SUSAN, How do you like the Merlot?,121
8805,ESTELLE, Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?,121
8806,MRS. ROSS," Oh, mother.",121
8807,GEORGE," She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot.",121
8808,FRANK," Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?",121
8809,GEORGE, Why don't we talk about it another time.,121
8810,FRANK," But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing!",121
8811,MRS. ROSS, Something's missing all right.,121
8812,MR. ROSS, They're all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them.,121
8813,FRANK, That's perverse.,121
8814,GEORGE, Did anybody see Firestorm?,121
8815,MR. ROSS," Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture.",121
8816,GEORGE, Yeah.,121
8817,MR. ROSS, Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car --,121
8818,FRANK, Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.,121
8819,MR. ROSS, It doesn't have anything to do with the plot!,121
8820,FRANK, Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!,121
8821,GEORGE, Oh mother of God.,121
8822,KRAMER," Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!",121
8823,JOHN," Thank you. Now, I'd like to play something th -- well, actually, it's my latest so it's nice and fresh. It's called "" Hot And Heavy.""",121
8824,GEORGE, Thank God that's over.,121
8825,ESTELLE, The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.,121
8826,FRANK, And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!,121
8827,GEORGE," So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.",121
8828,ESTELLE, It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.,121
8829,FRANK," Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that!",121
8830,ESTELLE, Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!,121
8831,GEORGE, What is this? The marble rye?,121
8832,MRS. ROSS," Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought.",121
8833,ESTELLE, We forgot to bring it in.,121
8834,FRANK," No, I brought it in. They never put it out.",121
8835,MRS. ROSS, Where is it?,121
8836,SUSAN, I don't know. Where'd you put it?,121
8837,MRS. ROSS, Right over there.,121
8838,SUSAN," Well, it's gone.",121
8839,GEORGE, You stole the bread?,121
8840,FRANK, What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?,121
8841,GEORGE, Because we brought it for them!,121
8842,FRANK," Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve.",121
8843,MRS. ROSS, Is it possible they took it back?,121
8844,SUSAN, Who would bring a bread and take it back?,121
8845,MR. ROSS," Those people, that's who. I think they're sick.",121
8846,ESTELLE, People take buses to get that rye.,121
8847,GEORGE, Maybe they forgot to put it out!,121
8848,FRANK," Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I tell ya!",121
8849,JERRY, He stole back the rye?,121
8850,GEORGE, Yeah.,121
8851,JERRY, Why?,121
8852,GEORGE, Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.,121
8853,JERRY," So, do the Ross's know?",121
8854,GEORGE, I don't know. They're all very suspicious.,121
8855,JERRY, Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.,121
8856,GEORGE," Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.",121
8857,JERRY, Bad situation.,121
8858,GEORGE, I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.,121
8859,JERRY, What do you mean replace it?,121
8860,GEORGE," You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.",121
8861,JERRY," Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?",121
8862,GEORGE, What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!,121
8863,JERRY," All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.",121
8864,GEORGE, So?,121
8865,JERRY," Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.",121
8866,GEORGE, And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?,121
8867,JERRY," Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.",121
8868,GEORGE," So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.",121
8869,JERRY, What about Susan?,121
8870,GEORGE, She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.,121
8871,JERRY, Beautiful!,121
8872,GEORGE, You think Kramer'll do it?,121
8873,KRAMER," Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?",121
8874,GEORGE, Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.,121
8875,KRAMER, Hey.,121
8876,JERRY, What the hell are you doing there?,121
8877,KRAMER, It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?,121
8878,JERRY, No. No thanks.,121
8879,KRAMER," Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.",121
8880,GEORGE, Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?,121
8881,JERRY, Just put it under your shirt.,121
8882,GEORGE, Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!,121
8883,JERRY," I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.",121
8884,GEORGE," Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! ",121
8885,ELAINE, Hey. Is that your horse outside?,121
8886,KRAMER, Yeah. That's Rusty.,121
8887,GEORGE, What? He's outside?,121
8888,KRAMER, Uh-huh.,121
8889,GEORGE," Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.",121
8890,KRAMER, You wanna go see him?,121
8891,GEORGE, Yeah. Hey! Hey!,121
8892,KRAMER, I'll show ya Rusty.,121
8893,GEORGE," Hey, Lainey, wanna see the horsey?",121
8894,ELAINE," Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.",121
8895,JERRY," So, you think Clyde told him?",121
8896,ELAINE, He wrote a song about it!,121
8897,JERRY," Well, maybe it's a good thing.",121
8898,ELAINE, No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?,121
8899,JERRY," No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.",121
8900,ELAINE," You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!",121
8901,JERRY," No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.",121
8902,ELAINE," I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.",121
8903,MR. ROSS," Yeah George, I gotta tell ya, this is a very nice gesture. We really appreciate it.",121
8904,GEORGE," Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?",121
8905,MR. ROSS," Oh, we got about twenty minutes. You, uh, seem a little nervous George. Anything wrong?",121
8906,GEORGE," Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?",121
8907,MRS. ROSS," We've got water. I don't think we have any bread, but we've got water.",121

8920,COUNTER WOMAN, That's what I said. Number 54.,121
8921,JERRY," Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.",121
8922,MABEL," Well, I'm sorry, but you should have got here earlier.",121
8923,JERRY," Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.",121

8937,MABEL, Stop thief! Stop him! He's got my marble rye!,121
8938,ELAINE," I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?",121
8939,JOHN," Whoa. Hold on, Elaine I.....I'm kinda disappointed.",121
8940,ELAINE, Disappointed?,121
8941,JOHN," Yeah. I mean, I was excited when Clyde told me that.",121

8943,JOHN, Absolutely.,121
8944,ELAINE, Ohh! Whew! I am so relieved!,121
8945,JOHN," Listen, uh, I've still got a couple of hours to kill before the next show. My place is only a few blocks from here.",121
8946,ELAINE, Really?,121
8947,JOHN, And you know what?,121
8948,ELAINE, What?,121
8949,JOHN," I've been thinking about what we do and I'm thinking..of...adding a new number to my, you know, repertoire.",121
8950,ELAINE, Ohh!,121
8951,KRAMER, Y'aah!,121

8953,MR. ROSS, I think it's the horse.,121
8954,MRS. ROSS," Oh, God.",121
8955,KRAMER," Hey, how's everything? You..you need anything?",121
8956,MRS. ROSS, This is - this is...horrible.,121

8965,MR. ROSS, Ask Rusty.,121

8967,MRS. ROSS," Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs.",121
8968,GEORGE, What the hell happened?,121
8969,KRAMER, The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.,121
8970,GEORGE, Beef-A-Reeno? You fed the horse Beef-A-Reeno?!,121
8971,KRAMER," Well, I overbought!",121

8978,KRAMER," Just a can. But he really liked it, though.",121
8979,GEORGE, Jerry! Up here!,121
8980,JERRY," Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?",121
8981,GEORGE, I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!,121
8982,JERRY, Really?,121
8983,GEORGE," Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?",121
8984,JERRY, Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.,121
8985,KRAMER, I don't wanna go back on there!,121
8986,GEORGE, Come on!,121
8987,JERRY, ,121
8988,GEORGE,"  Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.",121
8989,ELAINE," No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.",121
8990,GEORGE, Come on! Come on!,121

9264,GEORGE, What?,122
9265,JERRY," I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!",122
9266,GEORGE, Dead?  ,122
9267,JERRY," Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, it’s a little crumpled.",122
9268,GEORGE, My car’s a little crumpled?!?,122
9269,JERRY," Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!",122
9270,GEORGE," Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-I’ll -- I gotta figure something out here.",122
9271,JERRY, Well you gotta call your parents.,122
9272,GEORGE," I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!",122
9273,JERRY, Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?,122
9274,GEORGE, OOuuoo!  They could use the break!,122
9275,PETERMAN ," Elaine, do you see this?  Do you see what I'm holding in my hands?",122
9276,ELAINE," Yeah, it's a bra.",122
9277,PETERMAN," I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top.  What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be. Perhaps our paths will cross again some day.",122
9278,ELAINE, w-What is this all about?,122
9279,PETERMAN, I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's fashion.  ,122
9280,ELAINE," Oh-oh, but-",122
9281,PETERMAN, We're gonna sell this as a top. Here's the angle,122
9282,STEINBRENNER," Come in, come in.",122
9283,GEORGE, Mr. Steinbrenner--,122
9284,STEINBRENNER ," Ahhh, Ahhh!  Ah, ah ah!  Is it you?  ",122
9285,GEORGE," Yeah, it's me sir.  It's been a harrowing few days. uuh, After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.",122
9286,STEINBRENNER," Grubs, huh? Gotta admit, I never tasted one of those.  ",122
9287,GEORGE," Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.",122
9288,STEINBRENNER," Well, don't tell it to me George, tell it to the new Assistant to the General Manager.",122
9289,GEORGE, I didn't get the job?,122
9290,STEINBRENNER," Well, once you were dead, we couldn't just sit on our hands.  We had to make a move...",122
9291,STEINBRENNER," But, you still have your old job.  Of course, we'll have to dock you for the time you missed.  We're running a ball club here.  If I give special treatment to you, everyone will want it. Next thing you know its chaos!  And I can tell you this,  chaos does not work for the New York Yankees!  Not as long as I'm running the show!",122
9292,JACKIE," So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?",122
9293,ELAINE ," Yes...ummm,  yes, that's correct.",122
9294,JACKIE," And you have also brought with you, another bra,  exactly like, the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in!",122
9295,ELAINE," Yes, that's correct.",122
9296,JACKIE," Uh, what was you golf score, the last round you played… uh, before you shoulder was injured?",122
9297,KRAMER, Three under par.,122
9298,JACKIE ," Oooohhhh, three under par, Hmm…That's what the professionals shoot, isn't it?",122
9299,KRAMER, Well if they're lucky.,122
9300,JACKIE, Well would you tell this jury exactly what you saw at the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus?,122
9301,JERRY , I...don't remember.,122
9302,JACKIE," Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the bra?",122
9303,JERRY, I don't know.  Maybe.,122
9304,JACKIE," Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath.  Now I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing a bra?!?",122
9305,JERRY," ....Alright, alright, I saw her!…",122
9306,JERRY," And she was beautiful in that bra!  I'm crazy about her!  I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!",122
9307,JUDGE , This court will come to order!,122
9308,JACKIE," No further questions, your honor.",122

9310,JACKIE," Well Kramer, I think we got this wrapped up.",122
9311,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?",122
9312,STAN," You're close, you're on the green. You just have to go for the cup.",122
9313,KRAMER, What do you mean?,122
9314,STAN," Have her try on the bra, see if it fits.",122
9315,JACKIE," No, no, no, no!  ",122
9316,KRAMER," Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.",122
9317,JACKIE, Stan? Who the hell is Stan?  ,122
9318,KRAMER, He's my caddy.,122
9319,JACKIE, You're caddy?!?  This is a big mistake!  ,122
9320,KRAMER, Gu-gu- cada-,122
9321,JACKIE," Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra.",122
9322,JUDGE,"  This court will come to order!  Go ahead Miss Mishke, try it on.",122
9323,SUE ELLEN," Uhhh-Ah, it doesn't fit...I, I-I can't put it on.",122
9324,JACKIE ,"  Damn fools!  Look at that!  We got nothin' now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin' to a caddy!  ",122
9325,KRAMER," OK, OK-",122
9326,JACKIE ," This is a public humiliation!  You can't let the defendant, have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard.  A bra’s gotta fit right up against a person's skin, like a glove!",122
9327,ELAINE," Oh, no, I-I don't think so.",122
9328,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, thanks.",122
9329,ELAINE," Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.",122
9330,ELAINE,"  Oh, look at this!",123

9332,ELAINE,"  Oh, cool! Look at that!",123
9333,JERRY,"  Yeah, I'm right there with ya.",123
9334,ELAINE,"  That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.",123
9335,ELAINE, What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?,123
9336,JERRY,  Huh?,123
9337,ELAINE, What d'you think?,123
9338,JERRY," Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.",123
9339,ELAINE,  I love it. I'm getting it.,123
9340,ELAINE," Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.",123
9341,CHRISTIE, I think your friend needs some help over there.,123
9342,JERRY," You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.",123
9343,ELAINE, Hey!,123

9358,CARRIE, Pamela?,123
9359,GEORGE," Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.",123
9360,KEN, What?,123
9361,GEORGE, Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.,123
9362,CARRIE," I don't know, it sounds a little strange.",123
9363,GEORGE," All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?",123
9364,KEN," Yeah, but uh... Soda?",123
9365,GEORGE," Yeah, that's right. It's working.",123

9368,KRAMER,"  Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.",123

9375,KRAMER, No. That's bush league.,123
9376,JERRY," Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!",123
9377,KRAMER," No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.",123
9378,JERRY,"  Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.",123
9379,KRAMER," Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?",123
9380,JERRY, What arrangement?,123
9381,KRAMER," Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.",123
9382,JERRY,"  Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.",123
9383,KRAMER," Oh, hey.",123

9418,JERRY,  Oh yeah.,124
9419,KRAMER, I didn't know you made that kinda money.  Jeez.,124
9420,JERRY, What?,124
9421,KRAMER, I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.,124
9422,JERRY, I never shoulda told you.,124
9423,KRAMER," You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?",124
9424,JERRY," No, I can't feel anything.",124
9425,KRAMER," Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?",124

9432,JERRY, Maybe a Cadillac.,124
9433,KRAMER,  Cadillac. Ooh-la-la.,124
9434,JERRY," Yeah.  That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it.  I'm gonna do it.",124
9435,KRAMER, You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.,124
9436,JERRY," Oh, isn't that what it's all about?",124
9437,ELAINE, Who was Pippi Longstocking?,124

9470,ELAINE,"  Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.",124

9486,JERRY, How does she know Marisa Tomei?,124
9487,GEORGE," I don't know, I didn't ask.",124
9488,JERRY, You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?,124
9489,GEORGE, Not the point!,124
9490,JERRY, Alright.,124
9491,GEORGE, Can I finish?,124
9492,JERRY," Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.",124
9493,GEORGE," Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.",124
9494,JERRY," What d'you mean, could've?",124
9495,GEORGE," Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.",124

9500,JERRY," You know, she won an academy award?",124
9501,GEORGE,"  Hu-hu, like I don't know that?  My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!",124
9502,JERRY, Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.,124

9512,JERRY,  This is no good.,124
9513,JERRY, Hi.,124
9514,NICK," Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm uh, I'm with Plaza Cable. I'm sorry to bother you. I...I'm looking for the guy who lives over here. Been waiting about uh, heh, two hours. You uh, happen to know where he is?",124

9522,GEORGE,  I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!,124
9523,JERRY, Would you tell Susan about it?,124
9524,GEORGE,  Not necessarily.,124
9525,JERRY," Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.",124
9526,GEORGE,  Of course there's something wrong!  We had a pact!,124
9527,JERRY," Hey, cable guy's looking for you.",124
9528,KRAMER," Oh, yeah?",124
9529,JERRY, Yeah.,124
9530,KRAMER," Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.",124
9531,JERRY," Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.",124
9532,KRAMER," Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.",124
9533,JERRY, You don't seem too bothered by it.,124
9534,KRAMER," You remember what they did to me ten years ago? ""Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one"", or ""We'll be there between two and six""!  And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors.  Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?",124
9535,JERRY," Boy, I've never seen you like this.",124
9536,KRAMER," Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.",124
9537,MARISA," ...positrack, which was not available on the sixty-four Buick Skylark.",124

9540,SUSAN, I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again?,124
9541,GEORGE, I..I..I dunno.,124
9542,SUSAN," Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.",124
9543,SUSAN, Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.,124
9544,GEORGE,"  Hu, ha.",124
9545,ELAINE , Hello.,124
9546,GEORGE,"  Elaine, it's me, George.",124
9547,ELAINE, George. How come you're whispering?,124
9548,GEORGE,"  Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?",124

9573,ELAINE,"  So, when're you getting back from Florida?",124
9574,JERRY," Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?",124

9576,JERRY, Are you okay?,124
9577,ELAINE,"  Sure, sure.",124

9589,GEORGE,  Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!,124
9590,ELAINE, You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?,124
9591,GEORGE,  So what? So what if I do?,124
9592,ELAINE,  You're engaged!,124
9593,GEORGE,"  I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!",124
9594,JERRY, I notice you threw 'stocky' in there.,124
9595,GEORGE," Yeah, what the hell?!",124
9596,ELAINE, George! It's cheating.,124
9597,GEORGE,  It's not cheating if there's no sex!,124
9598,ELAINE, Yes it is!,124
9599,GEORGE,  Ahh!,124
9600,ELAINE,  Jerry!,124

9606,JERRY," Oh, right.",124
9607,ELAINE," So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...",124
9608,JERRY," No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.",124
9609,ELAINE," You sure? You sure? 'Cos, you know...",124
9610,JERRY, Maybe I'll let you pick me up.,124
9611,ELAINE,  Okay.,124
9612,ELAINE," Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there?  Wh...? Uhm, what?  Oh, really?",124
9613,ELAINE," Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.",124
9614,ELAINE," Huh, she's in the hospital.  She has an arrhythmia.",124
9615,GEORGE,  What about Marisa Tomei?!,124
9616,HELEN," Morty, what d'you have to open this box for?  There's already a box of cookies open.",124
9617,MORTY, I wanted a Chip Ahoy.,124
9618,HELEN, I don't like all these open boxes.,124
9619,MORTY," Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.",124
9620,JERRY, Surprise!,124
9621,MORTY,  Jerry!,124
9622,HELEN,"  Oh, my god!",124

9629,JERRY, You wanna know? Come on outside.,124
9630,MORTY, Outside? What's going on?,124
9631,HELEN," Whenever Jerry comes, something exciting happens.",124
9632,MORTY,  Heh hah!,124
9633,JERRY," C'mon, c'mon.",124
9634,JERRY," Well, what d'you think?",124
9635,MORTY, Look at this! Look at this!  You bought a Cadillac?!,124
9636,JERRY, I bought it for you. It's yours.,124
9637,MORTY, You what? You bought me a Cadillac?,124
9638,JERRY, I bought you a Cadillac.  Here you go.,124
9639,HELEN,  Are you out of your mind?,124
9640,JERRY, What?,124
9641,MORTY,  You don't want it? Are you kidding?,124
9642,HELEN, He's not buying us a Cadillac.,124
9643,MORTY," What are you, nuts?",124
9644,HELEN," It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.",124
9645,MORTY,  Can you believe this?!,124
9646,HELEN, I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.,124
9647,JERRY, How d'you know?,124
9648,HELEN," Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.",124
9649,JERRY, Why can't I buy my father a car?,124
9650,HELEN, Your father doesn't need a car.,124
9651,MORTY," Yes, I do!",124
9652,HELEN," Oh, Morty.",124
9653,MORTY, We're keeping it.,124
9654,HELEN, Over my dead body.,124
9655,JERRY,"  Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.",124
9656,MACHINE , Giddyup.,124
9657,NICK ," Yeah, this is Nick Stevens, from Plaza Cable.",124
9658,NICK ," Well, I waited all morning again. You said you were gonna be there from nine to one.",124
9659,NICK ," I was there. Where were you? You think I got nothing better to do than stand outside all morning, waiting for you to show up?!",124
9660,NICK , You're not gonna get away with this!,124
9661,MORTY," Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.",124
9662,JERRY, That's what I was thinking.,124
9663,JACK,"  Hello, Jerry.",124
9664,JERRY," Hiya, Jack.",124
9665,MORTY,"  So, how d'you like this?",124
9666,JACK, Who's car?,124
9667,MORTY, It's mine.,124
9668,JACK, Yours?,124
9669,MORTY, That's right. My son bought it for me.,124
9670,JACK, He what?,124
9671,MORTY, My son bought me the car. It's a present.,124
9672,JACK,  You bought it?,124
9673,JERRY, That's right. I bought it.,124
9674,MORTY, You ever see one so nice?,124
9675,JACK, Some car.,124
9676,MORTY, You wanna take a ride?,124
9677,JACK," No, thank you.",124
9678,MORTY," C'mon, take a ride.",124
9679,JACK, I don't wanna take a ride.,124
9680,MORTY, Why not?,124
9681,JACK, I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?!,124
9682,JERRY, He doesn't wanna take a ride.,124
9683,MORTY, Uh huh.,124
9684,JACK,"  What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.",124
9685,MORTY,  Thousands?!,124
9686,JACK," What? D'you think you're such a big shot now, because you got a Cadillac?",124
9687,MORTY,  Ahh!,124
9688,JACK,  Yaah!,124
9689,MORTY, Could you believe that guy?,124
9690,JERRY, Aahh!,124
9691,GEORGE," Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.",124
9692,GEORGE," You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but  uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say.  Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say.  So, what d'you, what d'you think?",124
9693,GEORGE,"  Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?",124
9694,KRAMER, Y'hello.,124
9695,NICK ,"  Hi, uh ah, Mister Kramer, ah, this is McNab down at the phone company. We've got a report about some trouble on your line.",124
9696,KRAMER," Hmm. Well, I haven't had any trouble.",124
9697,NICK ," Uh, the thing is, we happen to have a man right in your neighbourhood.",124
9698,KRAMER,"  Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.",124
9699,NICK, We can fix that. We can fix that.,124
9700,KRAMER,"  Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.",124
9701,NICK," Oh, right.  I'm sorry, I was looking at the wrong work order.",124
9702,KRAMER, Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.,124
9703,KRAMER," Hey, McNab!",124
9704,KRAMER, Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?,124
9705,MORTY," Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.",124
9706,HERB," C'mon Morty, it's been broken for six months already. What the hell are you doing?",124
9707,MORTY," Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible.",124
9708,JACK,  I'll bet you don't.,124
9709,MORTY, What was that?,124
9710,JACK," C'mon Morty, the jig is up!",124
9711,MORTY, What're you talking about?,124
9712,JACK," I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue. I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer.",124
9713,HERB," What's going on, Jack?",124
9714,JACK, I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury.,124
9715,MORTY, Stealing?!,124
9716,RALPH, What proof do you have?,124
9717,JACK, Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want?,124
9718,MORTY, My son bought me that car!,124
9719,JACK, Your son?,124
9720,MORTY, Yeah.,124
9721,JACK," Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year, at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!",124
9722,HERB, Jack's right! He stinks!,124
9723,RALPH, It's his material.,124
9724,MORTY," I tell you, he bought it for me!",124
9725,HERB,  I move for a full investigation!,124
9726,RALPH, I second.,124
9727,MARISA, ...go introduce myself.,124
9728,SUSAN," Hey! What're you watching?  Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too.  What, d'you have a thing for her?",124
9729,GEORGE,"  Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man.  Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner.  He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?",124
9730,SUSAN, What are you talking about?,124
9731,MARISA, Have I told you how much I love you today?,124
9732,GEORGE, Not in the last fifteen minutes.,124
9733,MARISA," Well, I do love you very much.",124
9734,GEORGE," And I love you, Marisa.",124
9735,MARISA," Well then, c'mon, get dressed. We're going to be late for the premiere.",124
9736,HELEN, Impeachment?,124
9737,MORTY, That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?,124
9738,HELEN, Can they do that?,124
9739,MORTY, If they get the votes.,124
9740,HELEN, I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.,124
9741,JERRY, Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.,124
9742,MORTY, It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.,124
9743,JERRY," You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!",124
9744,MORTY, No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.,124
9745,EVELYN, Hello?,124
9746,JERRY," Oh, hi Evelyn.",124
9747,EVELYN," Hello, Jerry.  I just got off the phone with Saul Brandus.",124
9748,HELEN, What'd he say?,124
9749,EVELYN, He's voting to impeach.,124
9750,EVELYN," Not because he think you stole the money, but mainly because you never thanked him for giving you his aisle seat at Freddy Roman's show.",124
9751,MORTY, I did so thank him!,124
9752,HELEN,"  No, he never heard you.  I told you he didn't hear you.",124
9753,MORTY," Ah, he's deaf anyway.",124
9754,EVELYN," Now, my sources tell me, there's three votes for impeachment, three votes against impeachment, and one undecided.",124
9755,MORTY, Who's that?,124
9756,EVELYN, Mrs Choate.,124
9757,JERRY, Who's she?,124
9758,MORTY," Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.",124
9759,HELEN," Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?",124
9760,MORTY, That's a good idea.,124
9761,EVELYN," Okay. I'll see you at the Lichtenberg's, tonight.",124
9762,HELEN,  The Lichtenberg's?,124
9763,EVELYN," Yes, they're having a party.",124
9764,HELEN, We weren't invited.,124
9765,EVELYN," Oh. Probably they think you're too good for them. You know, because of the car.",124
9766,JERRY ," Last week, on Seinfeld.",125
9767,JERRY , Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed?,125
9768,JERRY, Hello?,125
9769,ELAINE,  Hi Jerry.,125
9770,JERRY, Elaine? Wh..what's going on?,125
9771,ELAINE,"  I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.",125
9772,JERRY,"  You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?",125
9773,ELAINE," Well, it's just two hours by plane...",125
9774,JERRY," Gee, I dunno what to tell you.",125
9775,ELAINE," Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.",125
9776,ELAINE, Yeah?,125
9777,GEORGE,  Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!,125
9778,ELAINE,"  Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.",125
9779,GEORGE, Yeahhh.,125
9780,ELAINE, Goodbye.,125
9781,ELAINE,  Hi.,125
9782,JERRY, Hi.,125
9783,ELAINE," So, what d'you think?",125
9784,JERRY," Uh, I don't think so.",125
9785,ELAINE,  Oh.,125
9786,JERRY, I'll be back on Monday.,125
9787,ELAINE," Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call.  Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.",125
9788,JERRY," Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you.",125
9789,ELAINE,  Jerry? Jerry?,125
9790,JERRY,  Yeah.,125
9791,ELAINE,  Bye.,125
9792,JERRY, Bye.,125
9793,KRAMER, Hello.,125
9794,JOHN," Hello, Mister Kramer? This is John Hanaran, from Con Ed.",125
9795,KRAMER," Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it?",125
9796,JOHN ," Yeah. We've had some reports of power surges in your building. It seems some jokers were up on the roof, and they must've damaged some of the wires.",125
9797,KRAMER," Oh, you don't say.",125
9798,JOHN,"  Yeah. Either way, we need to get into your apartment and do a safety check.",125
9799,KRAMER,"  Ohh, you're good. You are really good.",125
9800,JOHN,  What're you talking about?,125
9801,GEORGE," Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei!  And I wasn't even that nervous.",125
9802,GEORGE," You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...",125
9803,ELAINE,"  Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?",125
9804,GEORGE," Hey, where you going?",125
9805,ELAINE, I got stuff to do.,125
9806,GEORGE, What? You can't leave yet.,125
9807,ELAINE, Why not?,125
9808,GEORGE, We have to discuss my alibi.,125
9809,ELAINE, Alibi? What does that have to do with me?,125
9810,GEORGE," I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.",125
9811,ELAINE," Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?",125
9812,GEORGE, Yes.,125
9813,ELAINE,"  Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.",125
9814,GEORGE," Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?",125
9815,ELAINE, What is the difference?,125
9816,GEORGE," Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?",125
9817,GEORGE," Okay. Now, why do I have to see  you?",125
9818,ELAINE," Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.",125
9819,GEORGE,  It's no good.,125
9820,ELAINE,  Okay. Fine.,125
9821,GEORGE, What?,125
9822,ELAINE, I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.,125
9823,GEORGE," Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.",125
9824,ELAINE," I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.",125
9825,GEORGE,"  Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.",125
9826,ELAINE,  Okay.,125
9827,GEORGE, Alright?,125
9828,ELAINE, Okay.,125
9829,GEORGE, Okay.,125
9830,ELAINE, Fine.,125
9831,GEORGE, Good.,125
9832,ELAINE," Fine, fine, fine.",125
9833,GEORGE, Okay. How about this?,125
9834,ELAINE, What?,125
9835,GEORGE,  You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.,125
9836,ELAINE, I don't have a boyfriend.,125
9837,GEORGE,  She doesn't know that. We say that you do.,125
9838,ELAINE,  Ech.,125
9839,GEORGE, It's good. Believe me.,125
9840,ELAINE, I thought my idea was just as good.,125
9841,GEORGE, The dentist thing?,125
9842,ELAINE,"  Yeah, right. The dentist thing.",125
9843,GEORGE," Alright, the dentist thing was not good.",125
9844,ELAINE," Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?",125
9845,GEORGE,  Art Vandelay.,125
9846,ELAINE,  Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?,125
9847,GEORGE, That's your boyfriend.,125
9848,ELAINE, What does he do?,125
9849,GEORGE, He's an importer.,125
9850,ELAINE, Just imports? No exports?,125
9851,GEORGE,  He's an importer-exporter. Okay?,125
9852,ELAINE," Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?",125
9853,GEORGE,  Yes. Yes.,125
9854,ELAINE,  Yi-yi-yi.,125
9855,ELAINE," Ah!  How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?",125
9856,ELAINE,"  Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?",125
9857,GEORGE, It's very complicated.,125
9858,ELAINE,"  You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?",125
9859,MORTY, What're you doing? Are you making coffee?,125
9860,HELEN, Yeah.,125
9861,MORTY," Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.",125
9862,HELEN," Morty, you're driving me crazy.",125
9863,MORTY," Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock.",125
9864,HELEN, You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.,125
9865,MORTY, There she is.,125
9866,MORTY," Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate.",125
9867,HELEN," Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat.",125
9868,MRS. CHOATE," No, no. I prefer to wear it. Nobody's taking my coat.",125
9869,HELEN," Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?",125
9870,MRS. CHOATE," Coffee? Ach. I'll take hot water with lemon, if you have it.",125
9871,HELEN, I'll see.  Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it?,125
9872,MRS. CHOATE," Ahh, they're a dime a dozen.",125
9873,HELEN," Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate,  this is my son, Jerry.",125
9874,JERRY, Gimme that rye!),125
9875,MRS. CHOATE," Stop it. Let go. Help! Someone, help!",125
9876,JERRY," Shut up, you old bag!",125
9877,MRS. CHOATE,"  Thief! Stop him! Stop him, he's got my rye!",125
9878,JERRY, Nice to meet you.,125
9879,MRS. CHOATE, Hello.,125
9880,MORTY,"  Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?",125
9881,MRS. CHOATE," Yeah. I was visiting my daughter, and I'll never go back. The crime there is just terrible. Do you know I got mugged for a marble rye, right on the street?",125
9882,HELEN,"  Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a rye?",125
9883,MORTY, That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.,125
9884,MRS. CHOATE, They're like savages.,125
9885,JERRY," Yeah, there's some sickos out there.",125
9886,MRS. CHOATE,  You look very familiar. Have we ever met?,125
9887,JERRY, You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?,125
9888,HELEN, Maybe you've seen him on television.,125
9889,MORTY, Jerry's a comedian.,125
9890,MRS. CHOATE," Naw, I don't watch TV.",125
9891,JERRY,"  Well, it was nice meeting you.",125
9892,MORTY," Jerry, don't go.",125
9893,JERRY," Ah, I think I'll go.",125
9894,MRS. CHOATE," So, Morty, what's this all about? What d'you want?",125
9895,SUSAN," Hey, where're you going?",125
9896,GEORGE, Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.,125
9897,SUSAN, Elaine? What for?,125
9898,GEORGE, I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.,125
9899,SUSAN, I didn't even know she was dating anyone.,125
9900,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.",125
9901,SUSAN, So what does he do?,125
9902,GEORGE, He's an importer-exporter.,125
9903,SUSAN, What kind of problems are they having?,125
9904,GEORGE,"  Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.",125
9905,SUSAN, Are you having an affair with Elaine?,125
9906,GEORGE,"  Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.",125
9907,SUSAN, Huh?,125
9908,NICK,  I'll get you! I'll get you Kramer! You won't get away with this!,125
9909,MORTY," Alright, are you ready to eat?",125
9910,HELEN,"  Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner.",125
9911,JERRY,  Dinner? W..What time is it?,125
9912,HELEN,  It's four-thirty.,125
9913,JERRY,  Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?,125
9914,MORTY," By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.",125
9915,JERRY, I don't understand why we have to eat now.,125
9916,HELEN, We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.,125
9917,MORTY," Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?",125
9918,JERRY," Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?",125
9919,HELEN, You're not buying us dinner.,125
9920,JERRY,"  I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!",125
9921,HELEN," Alright,  we'll wait.  But it's unheard of.",125
9922,GEORGE," ...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?",125
9923,MARISA,  You're so right. I never thought of it like that. Manure. 'Ma' and the 'newer'.,125
9924,MARISA, Did you just make that up?,125
9925,GEORGE," What, you think I'm doing material here?",125
9926,MARISA,"  No, no. It's hard to believe anyone could be so spontaneously funny.",125
9927,GEORGE,  And I'm a little tired.,125
9928,MARISA," So, tell me, how is it that a man like you, so bald, and so quirky and funny, how is it you're not taken?",125
9929,GEORGE," Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.",125
9930,MARISA, What?,125
9931,GEORGE," I'm, you know, engaged.",125
9932,JERRY ," Hey look, there's a spot right in front.",125
9933,MORTY," Always, Jerry. Always.",125
9934,DORIS, Was that delicious or what?,125
9935,JACK, Where you gonna get a better meal than that?,125
9936,DORIS, Better than Danny's.,125
9937,JACK, Danny's?  C'mon!,125
9938,MORTY, Hello Jack.,125
9939,HELEN, Doris.,125
9940,DORIS," Hello, hello.",125
9941,JERRY, Jack.,125
9942,DORIS," Hello, Jerry.",125
9943,JERRY, Hi Doris.,125
9944,JACK," Hello Morty.  Well, missed the early bird.",125
9945,MORTY," Yeah, so?",125
9946,JACK,  Must be nice to have that kind of money.,125
9947,JACK," Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock.  Your suddenly well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.",125
9948,MORTY, They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.,125
9949,JACK, That's what you think.,125
9950,MORTY, We'll see.,125
9951,JACK," Yes, we will.",125
9952,JERRY," Awright, let's eat already.",125
9953,ELAINE," Hi, Susan.",125
9954,SUSAN, Hi.,125
9955,ELAINE," Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.",125
9956,SUSAN,"  Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.",125
9957,ELAINE," Oh, sure.",125
9958,SUSAN,  Are you having an affair with George?,125
9959,ELAINE,"  Wha...?!  Ha ha ha. Ha, no.",125
9960,ELAINE,"  Don't be ridiculous!  I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...",125
9961,ELAINE," ...Well, obviously... You know...  Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?",125
9962,SUSAN," Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having.",125
9963,ELAINE,"  Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.",125
9964,SUSAN, Art Vandelay?,125
9965,ELAINE," Yeah, Art Vandelay.",125
9966,SUSAN, I'm sorry.  I feel like an idiot.,125
9967,ELAINE,"  No, no.  Huh-hu-hu. It's okay.",125
9968,SUSAN," Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?",125
9969,ELAINE, It is so forgotten.,125
9970,SUSAN, Alright.,125
9971,ELAINE," Okay.  Okay, no problem.",125
9972,SUSAN," So, was George helpful at all?",125
9973,ELAINE,"  Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful.  Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.",125
9974,SUSAN,  Yeah.,125
9975,ELAINE,"  Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.",125
9976,SUSAN,  Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting.,125
9977,ELAINE, What'd I say?,125
9978,SUSAN, The importing.,125
9979,ELAINE,  I did. Uh...,125
9980,SUSAN," So, what does he uh, import?",125
9981,ELAINE,  Uh... chips.,125
9982,SUSAN, Oh. What kinda chips?,125

9987,ELAINE, Diapers.,125
9988,SUSAN,  I'm sorry for bothering you.,125
9989,ELAINE," Oh, no, it's okay.",125
9990,ELAINE, Okay.,125
9991,ELAINE,"  C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.",125
9992,GEORGE, Hi.,125
9993,SUSAN," Hi.  So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?",125
9994,GEORGE, Matches? Long matches.,125
9995,HERB," ...There she is. Okay, if I can have your attention for a minute here. We're calling this emergency meeting of the board of phase two, to consider a motion of impeachment of our president,  Morty Seinfeld.",125
9996,MORTY," Nervous, Jack?",125
9997,JACK, What for?,125
9998,MORTY, Because I have the votes.,125
9999,MORTY," Nice to see you, Mrs Choate.",125
10000,MRS. CHOATE," Hello, Morty.",125
10001,HERB," Building A. Are you for, or against, the motion to impeach?",125
10002,RALPH, What does that mean?,125
10003,HERB," It means, if you're for the motion, you're against Morty.",125
10004,RALPH, So why don't you say that?,125
10005,HERB," Hey, I'm running the meeting.",125
10006,RALPH, If you think so.,125
10007,HERB, Building A?,125

10009,HERB, Building B?,125
10010,BUILDING B, Against impeachment.,125
10011,HERB, Building C?,125
10012,BUILDING C, For impeachment.,125
10013,HERB, Building D?,125
10014,MRS. CHOATE, Against impeachment.,125
10015,JACK,  I can't believe you got that old bag.,125
10016,MRS. CHOATE, Help! Someone help!,125
10017,JERRY," Shut up, you old bag!",125
10018,MRS. CHOATE,"  Oh, thief! Thief!",125
10019,MRS. CHOATE, It's him.  It's your son. Now I know where I saw him. He stole my marble rye.,125
10020,MORTY, My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.,125
10021,RALPH, They should lock him up.,125
10022,MRS. CHOATE,"  Like father, like son.  I change my vote. I vote to impeach!",125
10023,BUILDING B, Me too. I change my vote.,125
10024,HERB," All those in favour, say aye.",125
10025,ALL , Aye.,125
10026,HERB, All opposed.,125
10027,HERB, The ayes have it. The motion passes.,125
10028,HERB," Morty Seinfeld, you are officially dismissed as condo president. As vice-president, Jack Klompus, in accordance with the phase two constitution, is hereby installed as president.",125
10029,HERB," Hear, hear, Jack.",125
10030,NICK,"  Alright, I know you're in there. I know you can hear me. You win, okay? You win. I can't do it any more. What d'you want from me? Apology? Alright, I'm sorry. There, I said it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I see now how we made you feel when we made you sit home waiting. I dunno why we do it.  I guess maybe we just kind of enjoy taking advantage of people.  Well, that's gonna change. From now on, no more 'nine to twelve', no more 'one to five'. We're gonna have appointments. Eleven o'clock is gonna mean eleven o'clock. And, if we can't make it, we're gonna call you, tell you why.  For god's sakes, if a doctor can do it, why can't we?  Anyway, that's it.",125
10031,JERRY," The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.",125
10032,ELAINE," Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.",126
10033,DOCTOR, I'll need a urine sample.,126
10034,ELAINE, Right.,126
10035,GEORGE, You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.,126
10036,ELAINE," Oh, Come on.",126
10037,JERRY," Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?",126
10038,GEORGE," Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?",126
10039,JERRY," Yeah, sure. My parents will be there.",126
10040,ELAINE, The Tonight Show?,126
10041,JERRY," Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?",126
10042,ELAINE, Are you doing new material?,126
10043,JERRY, No.,126
10044,ELAINE, I don't think so.,126
10045,KRAMER, Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?,126
10046,JERRY," No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.",126
10047,KRAMER, Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.,126
10048,ELAINE, So what are your parents doing here in new York?,126
10049,JERRY," Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.",126
10050,ELAINE, So what are their plans?,126
10051,JERRY," Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.",126
10052,ELAINE, You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?,126
10053,JERRY," No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.",126
10054,GEORGE, Uncle Leo's having regular sex?,126
10055,JERRY," Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.",126
10056,JERRY,  Hello?,126
10057,MORTY," Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.",126
10058,JERRY, You gotta be there at 4,126
10059,MORTY, But it comes on 11,126
10060,JERRY," Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 11",126
10061,MORTY, How long they been doing this?,126
10062,JERRY, 30 years.,126
10063,MORTY," Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?",126
10064,JERRY," All right, I'll see you later.",126
10065,ELAINE," Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?",126
10066,GEORGE," Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?",126
10067,JERRY," Yeah, it is.",126
10068,GEORGE," I mean, they're retired.",126
10069,JERRY, No economic reason for them to be here.,126
10070,GEORGE, They have no friends.,126
10071,JERRY, No social reason for them to be here.,126
10072,ELAINE, You're all grown up.,126
10073,GEORGE," Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.",126
10074,HELEN, Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.,126
10075,JERRY," I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?",126
10076,HELEN, I can do that.,126
10077,JERRY, You know Dad just called me.,126
10078,HELEN," Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.",126
10079,JERRY," Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.",126
10080,HELEN, Ok.,126
10081,JERRY," All right, bye. ",126
10082,ELAINE, Ahh.,126
10083,JERRY," I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!",126
10084,ELAINE, They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?,126
10085,JERRY, The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.,126
10086,ELAINE, How's that gonna happen?,126
10087,UNCLE LEO, It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a week.,126
10088,JERRY,  Once a week?  So how's Lydia?,126
10089,UNCLE LEO," Ah, she's a real tiger.",126
10090,JERRY, I don't know how you do it.,126
10091,UNCLE LEO, What?,126
10092,JERRY," A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.",126
10093,UNCLE LEO, What are you talking about?,126
10094,JERRY, Well...,126
10095,UNCLE LEO," Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium.",126
10096,JERRY," Hey, it happens.",126
10097,UNCLE LEO, I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.,126
10098,JERRY, He has no idea who you are.,126
10099,UNCLE LEO," They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry.",126
10100,JERRY," All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, ""It's been real,"" move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.",126
10101,UNCLE LEO," Believe me, I thought about it. But she is so perfect in every way, I can't see a flaw.",126
10102,JERRY," Well, keep looking.",126
10103,PETERMAN," I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa.",126
10104,ELAINE, What? Why not?,126
10105,PETERMAN," I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium.",126
10106,ELAINE, Opium?,126
10107,PETERMAN," That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.",126
10108,ELAINE," Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.",126
10109,PETERMAN," Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine.",126
10110,ELAINE," Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.",126
10111,PETERMAN," All right, Elaine.",126
10112,ELAINE," Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman.  I'll be ready in three minutes.",126
10113,GEORGE," Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.",126
10114,FRANK," I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities.",126
10115,ESTELLE, What extremities?,126
10116,GEORGE," You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.",126
10117,ESTELLE," So George, why are you here?",126
10118,GEORGE," What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? ",126
10119,ESTELLE, What's this.,126
10120,GEORGE," That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.",126
10121,ESTELLE, I don't bet.,126
10122,GEORGE, What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.,126
10123,ESTELLE, I don't swim.,126
10124,GEORGE, You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.,126
10125,ESTELLE, Are you trying to get rid of us?,126
10126,GEORGE," Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.",126
10127,ELAINE, No?,126
10128,KRAMER, Jerry? Jerry!,126
10129,KRAMER," Wha, you too?",126
10130,JERRY, Yeah!,126
10131,KRAMER," These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.",126
10132,JERRY, Me either.,126
10133,KRAMER, If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.,126
10134,JERRY, You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.,126
10135,KRAMER,  Aw.,126
10136,JERRY, Where are you going?,126
10137,KRAMER, I gotta find another shower.,126
10138,KRAMER, They got you too?,126
10139,NEWMAN, This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!,126
10140,KRAMER," Oh, Elaine. Yeah.",126
10141,ELAINE," Kramer, you look terrible.",126
10142,KRAMER," Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.",126
10143,ELAINE, What's wrong with your shower?,126
10144,KRAMER, There's no water pressure.,126
10145,ELAINE, Why don't you just go see Jerry?,126
10146,KRAMER," Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.",126
10147,PETERMAN,  Not on my watch!  I won't have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else!,126
10148,ELAINE, Mr Peterman! What are you doing?,126
10149,PETERMAN," Elaine, you're out of control. You need help.",126
10150,ELAINE, Huh?,126
10151,PETERMAN," I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. ""Just a taste,"" he said. That was all it took.",126
10152,ELAINE," Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.",126
10153,PETERMAN," Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 5",126
10154,HELEN, All they serve is chicken?,126
10155,JERRY, There's more food down the hall.,126
10156,MORTY," Wrap it up, we'll take it home.",126
10157,JERRY," Oh, hi.",126
10158,ESTELLE, Hello Seinfelds.,126
10159,MORTY, Hello.,126
10160,HELEN, Hi.,126
10161,FRANK, This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.,126
10162,ESTELLE," Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.",126
10163,JERRY," Actually, I'm drunk.",126
10164,GEORGE," Hey, hey, how was Florida?",126
10165,MORTY," Well, we just bought a new place down there.",126
10166,ESTELLE," I know, we were looking at the brochure.",126
10167,MORTY, What?,126
10168,HELEN," Why, you thinking of moving?",126
10169,FRANK, Not really.,126
10170,MORTY," Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.",126
10171,FRANK, Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista?,126
10172,MORTY, That's right. They went like hotcakes.,126
10173,FRANK, How'd you get yours?,126
10174,MORTY, Got lucky.,126
10175,FRANK, Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!,126
10176,JERRY," I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.",126
10177,ELAINE," How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?",126
10178,WAITRESS," Yeah, it's hard to figure.",126
10179,ELAINE," I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.",126
10180,WAITRESS," Ah, the bush-men?",126
10181,ELAINE, And the bush-women.,126
10182,MAN,  Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing. I notice you're eating a poppy seed muffin.,126
10183,ELAINE," Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.",126
10184,MAN," Well, you know what opium is made from...",126
10185,ELAINE,  Poppies!,126
10186,JAY LENO," Welcome back. Talking with Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry, lemme ask you, I saw some people back there, they look like.. family? Is that family?",126
10187,JERRY," Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo,  I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.",126
10188,JERRY," Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.",126
10189,JERRY," Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?",126
10190,KRAMER,"  Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.",126
10191,JERRY," Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?",126
10192,KRAMER," I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?",126
10193,JERRY, No good?,126
10194,KRAMER, It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.,126
10195,JERRY," Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?",126
10196,KRAMER," Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.",126
10197,JERRY,  Chicken?,126
10198,KRAMER," Oh, yeah.",126
10199,ELAINE," Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!",126
10200,JERRY, Poppy seeds!,126
10201,KRAMER," Well, that makes sense.  Want some chicken?",126
10202,ELAINE," Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.",126
10203,JERRY, Hello Newman.,126
10204,NEWMAN," Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?",126
10205,ELAINE," Oh c'mon, Newman.",126
10206,NEWMAN, I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants.  If you don't mind?,126
10207,ELAINE, Jerry?,126
10208,NEWMAN," Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it!  All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.",126
10209,JERRY, Not from the footage I've seen.,126
10210,NEWMAN," Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?",126
10211,KRAMER, I'm down.,126
10212,NEWMAN, Jerry?,126
10213,ESTELLE," So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.",126
10214,GEORGE, Big news?,126
10215,ESTELLE, We're moving to Florida.,126
10216,GEORGE,"  What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy!  For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?",126
10217,FRANK," Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds.",126
10218,GEORGE, What do you mean?,126
10219,FRANK," They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del Boca Vista!",126
10220,GEORGE, So you're moving there for spite!,126
10221,FRANK, Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!,126
10222,GEORGE," That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!",126
10223,ESTELLE," So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?",126
10224,GEORGE," Oh, every chance I get.",126
10225,ESTELLE,  Ohhh.,126
10226,GEORGE, Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!,126
10227,JERRY, What's going on?,126
10228,GEORGE, My parents are moving to Florida!,126
10229,JERRY, Are you kidding?,126
10230,GEORGE, Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!,126
10231,JERRY, Where are they moving to?,126
10232,GEORGE, Del Boca Vista!,126
10233,JERRY," Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!",126
10234,GEORGE, I know!,126
10235,JERRY, We could visit together!,126
10236,GEORGE, Every five years!,126
10237,JERRY, That's incredible!,126
10238,GEORGE," I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?",126
10239,JERRY, Why?,126
10240,GEORGE, To spite your parents!,126
10241,JERRY, To spite my parents?,126
10242,GEORGE, Yeah!,126
10243,JERRY, Your parents are crazy!,126
10244,GEORGE," I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!",126
10245,JERRY, My parents are moving back too!,126
10246,GEORGE, Beautiful!,126
10247,MORTY, I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.,126
10248,HELEN," He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?",126
10249,MORTY, Hello?,126
10250,VOICE, This is Frank Costanza.,126
10251,MORTY, What do you want?,126
10252,FRANK," You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse. We're gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out!",126
10253,MORTY," I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.",126
10254,GEORGE, I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.,126
10255,JERRY, You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.,126
10256,JERRY, Hello.,126
10257,MORTY," Hello, Jerry? It's your father.",126
10258,JERRY," Oh, hi dad.",126
10259,MORTY," Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.",126
10260,MORTY, What was that?,126
10261,JERRY," Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?",126
10262,MORTY, Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.,126
10263,JERRY, But it's a big complex.,126
10264,MORTY," You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.",126
10265,JERRY," All right, fine. Come over here. ",126
10266,GEORGE, What?,126
10267,JERRY, They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.,126
10268,GEORGE, What? Why?,126
10269,JERRY, Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.,126
10270,GEORGE," Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.",126
10271,JERRY," You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.",126
10272,UNCLE LEO, Move back with Lydia?,126
10273,JERRY," C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody.",126
10274,UNCLE LEO," Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging.",126
10275,JERRY," Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.",126
10276,UNCLE LEO, But she's an anti-Semite.,126
10277,JERRY, Can you blame her?,126
10278,HELEN," You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?",126
10279,MORTY, Why would he mind? We're his parents.,126
10280,ELAINE, Oh.,126
10281,HELEN, Hi Elaine.,126
10282,ELAINE, Hello. Jerry's not here?,126
10283,HELEN, No.,126
10284,ELAINE, Huh.  Oh my god.,126
10285,HELEN, What?,126
10286,ELAINE," A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.",126
10287,HELEN, Why?,126
10288,ELAINE, It's a long story.,126
10289,HELEN," Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.",126
10290,ELAINE, What are you gonna do in there?,126
10291,HELEN, What am I gonna do in the bathroom?,126
10292,ELAINE, You gotta do me a favor.,126
10293,HELEN," Elaine, I really--",126
10294,ELAINE," Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.",126
10295,HELEN, You want my urine?,126
10296,ELAINE, I need a clean urine sample from a woman.,126
10297,HELEN, I don't know.,126
10298,ELAINE," Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?",126
10299,HELEN," Well, what am I gonna do it in?",126
10300,ELAINE," Well, one of those glasses.",126
10301,HELEN, Jerry's glasses?,126
10302,ELAINE," Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.",126
10303,HELEN," Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup?",126
10304,ELAINE," Yeah, a coffee cup's fine.",126
10305,HELEN, Or maybe a juice glass.,126
10306,ELAINE," Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.",126
10307,HELEN, This one is kind of scratched.,126
10308,ELAINE, It doesn't matter.,126
10309,HELEN, Howbout A milk glass.,126
10310,ELAINE," A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.",126
10311,HELEN, Jerry doesn't wash these very well.,126
10312,ELAINE," Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!",126
10313,SALESMAN," All right, I got everything here. I got the Cyclone F series, Hydra Jet Flow, Stockholm Superstream, you name it.",126
10314,JERRY, What do you recommend?,126
10315,SALESMAN, What are you looking for?,126
10316,KRAMER," Power, man. Power.",126
10317,NEWMAN, Like Silkwood.,126
10318,KRAMER, That's for radiation.,126
10319,NEWMAN, That's right.,126
10320,KRAMER,"  Now, what is this?",126
10321,SALESMAN," That's the Commando 450, I don't sell that one. What about thi-",126
10322,KRAMER," Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.",126
10323,SALESMAN," Nah, believe me. It's only used in the circus. For elephants.",126
10324,NEWMAN, We'll pay anything. We've got the  What about Jerry?,126
10325,KRAMER," He couldn't handle that, he's delicate.",126
10326,HELEN, It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.,126
10327,MORTY," First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?",126
10328,MORTY, Who is it?,126
10329,SUPER, It's the super. We're installing new low-flow showerheads in all the bathrooms.,126
10330,MORTY, Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.,126
10331,PETERMAN," So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you.",126
10332,ELAINE, Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?,126
10333,PETERMAN, I'm afraid I can't take you.,126
10334,ELAINE, What? Why not?,126
10335,PETERMAN," Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman.",126
10336,ELAINE, But I wanted to see the bushmen.,126
10337,PETERMAN," Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis.",126
10338,JERRY," Well, it's been a great visit.",126
10339,MORTY," Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower.",126
10340,JERRY," Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.",126
10341,HELEN, George must be happy about that.,126
10342,JERRY, You have no idea.,126
10343,FRANK, Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.,126
10344,ESTELLE, What does he want with your swim trunks?,126
10345,FRANK, Why should they go to waste?!?,126
10346,JERRY, Thank you! Goodnight! ,127
10347,SALLY, Jerry!,127
10348,JERRY,  Hey. Hey!,127
10349,SALLY,  Sally Weaver!  Susan Ross' roommate from college.. hello! ,127
10350,JERRY," Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?",127
10351,SALLY, Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny.,127
10352,JERRY,"  Oh, thanks.",127
10353,SALLY,"  No, no, I mean it. You're very funny.",127
10354,JERRY,  I believe you.,127
10355,SALLY," Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you  out to dinner.",127
10356,JERRY,"  Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.",127
10357,SALLY," Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko!  You know what, um..  You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here.  It's a wedding present.",127
10358,JERRY, Oh?,127
10359,SALLY," And Jerry? Be careful with it, okay? Be very careful.",127
10360,JERRY, Uh-huh.,127
10361,FRANK," George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.",127
10362,GEORGE,  I am aware.,127
10363,FRANK," So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?",127
10364,GEORGE, A billiard parlor?,127
10365,FRANK," Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..",127
10366,GEORGE," Well, that's.. Elaine!",127
10367,ELAINE," Oh, hi, Frank.",127
10368,GEORGE,"  Sit down. Join us, please.",127
10369,ELAINE,"  Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.",127
10370,GEORGE,"  Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.",127
10371,ELAINE,"  Okay..  So..  Frank, did George ever show you that photo?",127
10372,GEORGE,  What photo?,127
10373,ELAINE," You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said ""Costanza""?",127
10374,FRANK,  There's a Costanza in Tuscany?  Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?,127
10375,ELAINE," I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.",127
10376,FRANK," I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.",127
10377,ELAINE, Who is that?,127
10378,GEORGE,"  When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.",127
10379,FRANK, I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.,127
10380,ELAINE," So, you weren't born here?",127
10381,FRANK," No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote.  They don't want me, I don't want them!",127
10382,GEORGE, I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-,127
10383,FRANK,  Don't bring me down.  Do you have another copy of that photo?,127
10384,ELAINE," No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.",127
10385,FRANK, The Maestro? What Maestro?,127
10386,ELAINE," He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.",127
10387,GEORGE, Really? Why?,127
10388,ELAINE,  Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.,127
10389,GEORGE, Who?,127
10390,ELAINE, You know the Three Tenors?,127
10391,GEORGE, Yeah..  Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.,127
10392,ELAINE,  The other guy.,127
10393,STEWARDESS,  Could I take that box for you?,127
10394,JERRY," Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.",127
10395,STEWARDESS," Oh, then, I'll have to put your bag in the over-head.",127
10396,JERRY," Oh, okay..",127
10397,STEWARDESS, There we go.,127
10398,JERRY, Ohh.. look at this..,127
10399,KRAMER, What?,127
10400,JERRY, I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this,127
10401,KRAMER," Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..",127
10402,JERRY," I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.",127
10403,KRAMER,  I see..,127
10404,JERRY," No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.",127
10405,KRAMER," Well, why don't you do your material?",127
10406,JERRY, I'm out.,127
10407,KRAMER,"  Well, you better get to work.",127
10408,JERRY,  Thanks for the tip.,127
10409,GEORGE," Hey, buddies.",127
10410,JERRY," Hey. Hey, this is for you.  It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.",127
10411,GEORGE, Oh yeah..  Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.,127
10412,JERRY,  Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box.  What the hell are you doing?,127
10413,KRAMER,  I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? ,127
10414,JERRY,"  Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.",127
10415,KRAMER,"  Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?",127
10416,JERRY, Like what?,127
10417,KRAMER," Well, uh..  ""What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?""",127
10418,JERRY,  Where's the punchline?,127
10419,KRAMER, It's all attitude.. ,127
10420,GOERGE,"  Well, this is certainly a crappy gift..",127
10421,JERRY, A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!,127
10422,GEORGE," Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.",127
10423,JERRY, Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!,127
10424,KRAMER," Look, it's personalized.  ""The Costanzas""",127
10425,GEORGE," No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.",127
10426,KRAMER," Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.",127
10427,GEORGE, I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.,127
10428,KRAMER,"  Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..",127
10429,KRAMER," So, what's your game? What do you like to play?",127
10430,FRANK, Eight ball.,127
10431,KRAMER," No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?",127
10432,FRANK," You like to gamble, Cosmo?",127
10433,KRAMER," Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..",127
10434,FRANK," Five dollars a game, huh?",127
10435,KRAMER, I'll break.,127
10436,FRANK, Okay.,127
10437,GEORGE, What's all this?,127
10438,SUSAN," Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.",127
10439,GEORGE,  More stuff..,127
10440,SUSAN,"  Oh, I put up my doll collection..",127
10441,GEORGE, Oh my God! What is that?!,127
10442,SUSAN,  What? What is it?,127
10443,GEORGE,  This doll  looks like my mother.,127
10444,SUSAN," George, it's a doll.",127
10445,GEORGE," I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!",127
10446,SUSAN,"  Oh, get outta here..",127
10447,ESTELLE, What's going on in here?  Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!,127
10448,FRANK, We still haven't finished the first game.,127
10449,ESTELLE, The first game?!,127
10450,KRAMER,"  Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.",127
10451,FRANK,  he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..,127
10452,ESTELLE," Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.",127
10453,FRANK,"  You don't know that!  We're gonna go see him, huh?",127
10454,KRAMER,  As soon as the game is over..,127
10455,FRANK,  Oh boy.,127
10456,KRAMER," Eleven, corner pocket. ",127
10457,GEORGE, What is this thing doing here?,127
10458,SUSAN," Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl..",127
10459,GEORGE," Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this..",127
10460,SUSAN, Why?,127
10461,GEORGE, I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.,127
10462,SUSAN," Oh, stop it.",127
10463,JERRY," Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.",127
10464,ELAINE,  Oh yeah?,127
10465,JERRY," Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!",127
10466,ELAINE,"  Oh, that's dynamite.",127
10467,JERRY," Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?",127
10468,ELAINE, Who else is on the show?,127
10469,JERRY, Uh.. one of the three tenors.,127
10470,ELAINE,  The Three Tenors?  Which one?!,127
10471,JERRY, Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..,127
10472,ELAINE,  The other guy?!,127
10473,JERRY,"  Yeah, the other guy.",127
10474,ELAINE,  My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!,127
10475,JERRY, Why?,127
10476,ELAINE, Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?,127
10477,JERRY, Why not?,127
10478,ELAINE,  Wow! The other guy!,127
10479,JERRY," Hey, you look awful.",127
10480,GEORGE,"  I'm on no sleep, bro.",127
10481,JERRY, Problem in the bedroom?,127
10482,GEORGE,  Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.,127
10483,JERRY, Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?,127
10484,GEORGE,"  ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky.  It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.",127
10485,JERRY, I thought you didn't want the doormat.,127
10486,GEORGE, I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.,127
10487,JERRY," Sally?  Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?",127
10488,GEORGE," Yeah,  Susan said you'd be excited.",127
10489,JERRY, Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!,127
10490,ELAINE, Who's Sally?,127
10491,GEORGE, Susan's college roommate.,127
10492,JERRY, It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.,127
10493,GEORGE, So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.,127
10494,JERRY,"  I will - don't worry.  In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!",127
10495,ELAINE, That's sounds pretty juvenile.,127
10496,JERRY,  Hey! A dinosaur!,127
10497,FRANK," His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him.",127
10498,MAESTRO, Unfortunately those photographs are at home.,127
10499,KRAMER," Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.",127
10500,FRANK,"  Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?",127
10501,KRAMER, A billiard room.,127
10502,FRANK," No, not billiard..  Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..",127
10503,KRAMER,  What?,127
10504,FRANK," We call it.. the, uh..",127
10505,KRAMER,  The Place To Be!,127
10506,FRANK, The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.,127
10507,MAESTRO,"  Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen,  if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony.",127
10508,KRAMER," Oh, yeah?",127
10509,MAESTRO,"  Ohh, my pants.  It's an old conductor's trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein.",127
10510,KRAMER, Really?,127
10511,MAESTRO, You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance.,127
10512,KRAMER, That's good thinking.,127
10513,GEORGE, You see?.. You see?!,127
10514,JERRY," Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.",127
10515,GEORGE," Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!",127
10516,JERRY, Why don't you just get rid of it?,127
10517,GEORGE," I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming.  Susan's so attached to this thing.",127
10518,JERRY," Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.",127
10519,GEORGE," Hi, Elaine.",127
10520,ELAINE, Did you see that?!,127
10521,JERRY, I'm just glad it's outta here.  What's that? ,127
10522,ELAINE," Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.",127
10523,JERRY, Oh.  Yeah?,127
10524,SALLY,  It's Sally.,127
10525,JERRY," Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?",127
10526,SALLY, A whole case.,127
10527,JERRY,"  Excellent.  So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?",127
10528,ELAINE,  No.,127
10529,JERRY, How come? I told you - It's fantastic.,127
10530,ELAINE," Eh, I like mine.",127
10531,JERRY," I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?",127
10532,ELAINE, I don't want it.,127
10533,JERRY,  I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.,127
10534,ELAINE,  It doesn't matter to me.,127
10535,JERRY, Come in.,127
10536,SALLY,"  Well, here I am!",127
10537,JERRY," Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.",127
10538,ELAINE, Hi.,127
10539,JERRY, How was your flight?  Pretty uncomfortable?,127
10540,SALLY,"  Actually, the seat next to me was empty, so, there was no problem at all.",127
10541,JERRY,"  Oh..  Oh, wait..  This isn't the sauce that I asked for!",127
10542,SALLY," That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. ""The Pride of Memphis!""",127
10543,JERRY,"  No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!",127
10544,SALLY," This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other sauce as  kind of a joke.",127
10545,JERRY, I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing.  Nothing!,127
10546,SALLY, You could just do your material.,127
10547,JERRY,  I don't have any material!,127
10548,ELAINE,  He's got nothin'!,127
10549,DOLL, Georgie! Don't eat with your hands!  Why do you eat so fast?! You can't even taste it!,127
10550,GEORGE,  Don't tell me how to eat!,127
10551,DOLL, You're wearing that shirt? You've had it for five years already! Why don't you get a new shirt?!,127
10552,GEORGE,"  Because I like this one!  C'mon, let's go. Let's go!  Oh, hi.. ",127
10553,WOMAN,  That man should really be in a sanitarium. ,127
10554,KRAMER," Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.",127
10555,FRANK, It's him!  It's Carlo Costanza!,127
10556,KRAMER, Come on. Are you sure?,127
10557,FRANK, I'd know him anywhere.,127
10558,MAESTRO, I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot.,127
10559,FRANK, I still say we're related.,127
10560,MAESTRO,"  Ohh, I love this piece. ",127
10561,KRAMER," Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot.",127
10562,FRANK,  I can't make anything..,127
10563,KRAMER,"  Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.",127
10564,FRANK, Follow through? What do you mean?,127
10565,KRAMER," Right here, come on, I'll show you..  Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..",127
10566,FRANK," It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.",127
10567,ESTELLE," Oh, my God!",127
10568,JERRY,  That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.,127
10569,ELAINE," Well, have you ever considered writing new material?",127
10570,JERRY," Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.",127
10571,ELAINE,  Me? Are you talking about me?,127
10572,JERRY,  No. You're never here.,127
10573,ELAINE,"  Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?",127
10574,JERRY," Yeah. Really.  Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.",127
10575,ELAINE, What?,127
10576,JERRY, Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny.  I'm gonna call them.,127
10577,SALLY, Hello?,127
10578,JERRY," Hello, Susan? It's Jerry.",127
10579,SALLY," Hi Jerry, it's Sally!",127
10580,JERRY,  Oh. Is George there?,127
10581,SALLY," No, but he should be home soon.",127
10582,JERRY," Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.",127
10583,SALLY, Is this for your comedy routine?,127
10584,JERRY,  Yes.,127
10585,SALLY,  Don't worry.  I'm on the case.,127
10586,MAESTRO,"  I, uh, think I'll get some air. ",127
10587,KRAMER," Yeah..  See? This is no good..  Hey, the baton.  I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss.  13 in the side pocket.  Giddy-up.  Six in the corner.  This table's mine.  You know where it's going..",127
10588,ELAINE, Hey!,127
10589,JERRY, Hey!,127
10590,ELAINE, Is George here?,127
10591,JERRY, Not yet.  The other guy.,127
10592,ELAINE," It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?",127
10593,CARRERAS, My pleasure. ,127
10594,ELAINE,"  Oh, thank you so much.  Thank you so much, Mr..  Camaro.  Mr. Casea?  Well, whatever.  I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.",127
10595,JERRY,"  Well, that's one hell of a gig.  Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!",127
10596,ELAINE,  Ohh.. thank you.  Huh..  Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?,127
10597,JERRY," Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.",127
10598,ELAINE,  How am I supposed to carry this thing?  What are you doing?,127
10599,JERRY," Well, I want to sit down.",127
10600,ELAINE, So?,127
10601,JERRY, It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. ,127
10602,MAESTRO,"  Madame, you have been an extremely gracious hostess. ",127
10603,ESTELLE,"  Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. ",127
10604,FRANK,"  Here, take a look at this.",127
10605,ESTELLE,"  Yeah, what is it?",127
10606,FRANK, It's Carlo. I found him!,127
10607,ESTELLE,  You've been cooped up in this room too long.,127
10608,FRANK,  You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants? ,127
10609,KRAMER,"  Aw, beautiful!",127
10610,SALLY," Hey there, Mr. Hairy legs!",127
10611,JERRY,  Where's George?,127
10612,SALLY," Don't worry, I brought your doll..  Tada!",127
10613,JERRY,  No! That's the wrong doll!,127
10614,SALLY," Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! This doll's much funnier. Look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat.. I think it's a riot!",127
10615,JERRY,  This is a nightmare.,127
10616,SALLY," Oh well, I'll be watching.  Don't screw up. ",127
10617,JERRY, My pants!,127
10618,STAGEHAND," Mr. Seinfeld, you're on.",127
10619,MAESTRO, Elaine? What a surprise.,127
10620,ELAINE," I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.",127
10621,MAESTRO, Ohh..  Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush I've heard so much about..,127
10622,ELAINE," No, no, no. Not the toothbrush..  this.",127
10623,MAESTRO," Ohh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite tenor, with.. those two other guys. Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico!",127
10624,ELAINE," Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..",127
10625,STAGEHAND,"  Maestro, you're on!",127
10626,MAESTRO," Oh, Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate.",127
10627,ELAINE," Oh, ok! ",127
10628,SUSAN, I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.,127
10629,GEORGE, I just wanted a second opinion.,127
10630,FRANK,"  Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother- ",127
10631,DOLL," Oh, stop bothering everybody with that picture. It's ridiculous!",127
10632,FRANK,  Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous!  Come here!,127
10633,SUSAN,"  No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!",127
10634,FRANK,  There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?!,127
10635,GEORGE,  I told you it looked like her..,127
10636,FRANK,"  Carlo! It's me, Frank!  I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?",127
10637,MAN, Carlo? No. Mi nome e Giuseppe.,127
10638,FRANK,  What do you know.. Alright.  I guess I was wrong. ,127
10639,JERRY,"The other thing I love is when you're in the middle of a dream, and the alarm goes off. You incorporate the sound of the alarm into the dream, so you can keep sleeping. And you'll make any adjustment in the dream to do it. I was with Marie Antoinette in a dream last night, and she was on the guillotine, the blade came down, her head fell into the basket, it rolled over and she started singing Neil Diamond's 'Solitary Man'. And, I thought, ""That is not my alarm going off. This is actually happening.""",128
10640,GEORGE,  June. It's June.,128
10641,GEORGE,  Hey!,128
10642,GEORGE, It's June. Mark's Michelle is a dog.,128
10643,GEORGE," June, June, June.",128
10644,GEORGE,"  Hey, he-hah. It's June, June.",128
10645,GEORGE, It's Juu-uu-une! Hey hay. Yes.,128
10646,GEORGE, I love Juu-uuu-uu-uune!,128
10647,GEORGE," June. Juune, baby!",128
10648,JERRY, What?,128
10649,GEORGE, The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.,128
10650,JERRY, Dead man walking.,128
10651,GEORGE,  Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.,128
10652,JERRY," Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.",128
10653,GEORGE," Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.",128
10654,JERRY, She did?,128
10655,GEORGE, Yeah.,128
10656,JERRY, So? Wheels?,128
10657,GEORGE, In motion. The wheels are in motion.,128
10658,JERRY, Beautiful.,128
10659,GEORGE," Aah, hey.  If this works out, forget about it. Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good as if I didn't get married.",128
10660,JERRY," So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.",128
10661,GEORGE, The Friars Club?,128
10662,JERRY," Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.",128
10663,KRAMER," Hey everybody.  Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright?",128
10664,JERRY, Catnap?,128
10665,KRAMER," No, no, no, no.  This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?",128
10666,JERRY,  That must be some book.,128
10667,KRAMER," Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years.",128
10668,JERRY, Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.,128
10669,KRAMER," Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.",128
10670,JERRY, I didn't know you had a hopper.,128
10671,KRAMER,"  Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.",128
10672,PETERMAN," Alright, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met good fellow, to Bob Grossberg, who's joining us from Business Affairs.",128
10673,BOB, Thanks. Hi everybody.,128
10674,PETERMAN," Bob, we have a little baptism by fire for you, so to speak.",128
10675,ELAINE,  Poor bastard.,128
10676,PETERMAN,  I want you to handle all the fact-checking and the copy-editing for the new catalogue.,128
10677,BOB," Ah, could you repeat that?",128
10678,PETERMAN,  Why don't you handle all the copy-editing?,128
10679,BOB,  I..I'm sorry. What?,128
10680,PETERMAN,  Copy-editing!,128
10681,PETERMAN," Eh, never mind.  Elaine, you do it.",128
10682,JERRY," Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.",128
10683,JERRY,"  Oh, I'm sorry.",128
10684,HALLIE,  How embarrassing this must be for you.,128
10685,JERRY,  You just bought your own dinner.,128
10686,JERRY,  'Scuse me.,128
10687,GEORGE,  Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.,128
10688,GEORGE, Friars.,128
10689,JERRY," Hey, not bad.  I kinda like this little thing here.",128
10690,GEORGE," Hup, here we go. Here we go.",128
10691,GEORGE,"  Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard",128
10692,SUSAN,"  Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie  taste this fish. It's really delicious.",128
10693,JERRY,  That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.,128
10694,GEORGE,"  Oh, get outta here.",128
10695,JERRY,"  I mean, come on.  No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.",128
10696,HALLIE,"  Mmm, it is good.",128
10697,SUSAN,  What do you think about having fish for the wedding?,128
10698,GEORGE,"  You watch the old videos.  I'm telling you, look at him.",128
10699,HALLIE,  Oh. Remember  wedding?,128
10700,JERRY," Oh, come on.",128
10701,GEORGE, Look...,128
10702,JERRY, Alright.,128
10703,JERRY,  This is nice.,128
10704,KRAMER," Yeah, morning.",128
10705,JERRY, Morning?,128
10706,KRAMER," Yeah, what time is it?",128
10707,JERRY,  Ten-thirty.,128
10708,KRAMER,"  Ah, see.  I got the whole night ahead of me.  Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?",128
10709,JERRY,"  Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.",128
10710,KRAMER," Yeah, I like that crest.  Alright, here we go.",128
10711,JERRY, Breakfast?,128
10712,KRAMER,  Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.,128
10713,JERRY, So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?,128
10714,KRAMER,"  Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea.  A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. ",128
10715,JERRY, What d'you call it?,128
10716,KRAMER, P B and J's. What d'you think?,128
10717,JERRY,  I think you need more sleep.,128
10718,KRAMER,  Ahh.,128
10719,JERRY," So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?",128
10720,KRAMER," I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.",128
10721,JERRY," Oh, now you're being ridiculous.",128
10722,KRAMER,"  He he, yeah.",128
10723,JERRY,  No milk?,128
10724,KRAMER," Oh, I'll be back.",128

10732,JERRY,  Four in the morning?!,128
10733,KRAMER, Yeah.,128
10734,JERRY," Well, what's wrong with you?",128
10735,KRAMER," I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?",128
10736,JERRY, No. Would you just get out?,128
10737,KRAMER, You wanna rent a movie?,128
10738,JERRY, No!,128
10739,KRAMER," Well, what am I gonna do?",128
10740,JERRY, Ready for lunch?,128
10741,ELAINE,"  I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.",128
10742,ELAINE," Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.",128
10743,JERRY, You think he's faking?,128
10744,ELAINE," I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.",128
10745,BOB," Hey Elaine.  Oh, you have a friend.",128
10746,BOB,  Just wanted to say hi.,128
10747,ELAINE," Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?",128
10748,BOB,  I..I'm sorry. What?,128
10749,ELAINE,  I'm kind of swamped.,128
10750,BOB, Thank you. I'm having lunch with Mr P. I better get going.,128
10751,ELAINE," Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?",128
10752,JERRY, That was him?,128
10753,ELAINE, Yes.,128
10754,JERRY, Somehow I thought he'd be taller.,128
10755,ELAINE," Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.",128
10756,JERRY,"  Alright, I'll see you later.",128
10757,ELAINE, Alright.,128
10758,JERRY," Hey, Bob.",128
10759,JERRY, Bob.,128
10760,JERRY," Hey, Bobby, over here.",128

10767,ELAINE,"  Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here.",128
10768,JERRY," No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.",128
10769,ELAINE, So what?,128
10770,JERRY," No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.",128
10771,ELAINE, Get out! What'd you do?,128
10772,JERRY," Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.",128
10773,ELAINE,  And?,128
10774,JERRY," Well, he flinched, sort of.",128
10775,ELAINE," What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?",128
10776,JERRY," Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.",128
10777,ELAINE, So you don't know anything?,128
10778,JERRY," Actually, no.",128
10779,ELAINE,"  Alright, good job.",128
10780,JERRY, Right.,128
10781,JERRY, Come in.,128
10782,GEORGE,"  Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something?",128
10783,JERRY, That was something.,128
10784,GEORGE," Ah. She's great, isn't she?",128
10785,JERRY,  Fantastic. Fantastic woman.,128
10786,GEORGE, I told you.,128
10787,JERRY, I'm nuts about her.,128
10788,GEORGE, You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?,128
10789,JERRY, She could be an 'it'.,128
10790,GEORGE,  We might have an 'it'!,128
10791,JERRY, She's got 'it' written all over her.,128
10792,GEORGE," She's got everything, right?  She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.",128
10793,JERRY," Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.",128
10794,GEORGE," Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.",128
10795,JERRY, Whatever.,128
10796,GEORGE,"  Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?",128
10797,JERRY, That doesn't sound right.,128
10798,GEORGE," No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.",128
10799,JERRY, Flying Sandos. Beautiful.,128
10800,GEORGE," Great. Seven-thirty, alright?",128
10801,JERRY, Walk me down to the Friars.,128
10802,GEORGE," Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...",128
10803,JERRY, It's not here.,128
10804,GEORGE, What?,128
10805,JERRY," Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.",128
10806,KRAMER," Oh, boy.",128
10807,JERRY,  Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night.  Where the hell is that jacket?,128
10808,KRAMER," Oh, the one with the crest.",128
10809,JERRY, Yeah.,128
10810,JERRY," Oh, well, that's at the cleaners.",128
10811,JERRY, The cleaners? How did it get there?,128
10812,KRAMER," Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.",128
10813,JERRY,  Great.,128
10814,KRAMER,  Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.,128
10815,JERRY, Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!,128
10816,KRAMER," Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.",128
10817,JERRY, Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.,128
10818,GEORGE, Won't be a problem...,128
10819,JERRY,  Hey.,128
10820,JERRY,  Hey!!,128
10821,KRAMER," Watch out, boy.",128

10824,ELAINE,"  I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...",128
10825,ELAINE, ...so much. You're so damn...sexy.,128
10826,ELAINE,  Ohh. I'm starting to unbutton.,128

10832,SUSAN, Jerry.,128
10833,GEORGE," Isn't that the uh, Friars Club jacket?",128
10834,JERRY," Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.",128
10835,GEORGE," Sure, sure, sure, sure.  How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.",128
10836,JERRY," Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.",128
10837,KRAMER," So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?",128
10838,CONNIE," Mmm, no, Cosmo. I like just being here with you.",128
10839,KRAMER," Oh, it's uh, it's a bold adventure.",128
10840,KRAMER," Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.",128
10841,JERRY,  I don't think so.,128
10842,JERRY, My jacket?,128

10848,CONNIE,"  Uh, honey, can you move a little, this hurts.",128
10849,CONNIE,  Cosmo?,128
10850,CONNIE,"  Oh my god. Cosmo, wake up!",128
10851,CONNIE, Cosmo?,128
10852,CONNIE,  Oh my god! He's dead! He's dead.,128
10853,CONNIE,"  Yeah, Tommy, this is Connie. You gotta help me. Some guy dropped dead on top of me.  I can't call the cops, 'cos Joey might find out.  I can't. I'm stuck. You gotta help me.",128
10854,GEORGE, This is very exciting. The inner sanctum.,128
10855,JERRY, Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.,128
10856,JERRY,"  I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.",128
10857,JERRY," Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.",128
10858,JERRY, It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.,128
10859,HALLIE," Jerry, I'm sure it'll turn up.",128
10860,JERRY,  I'm sure it won't.,128
10861,HALLIE, Don't worry. I'll get the jacket back.,128
10862,GEORGE,"  Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back.  So, let's go get some coffee, huh?",128
10863,JERRY,"  No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.",128
10864,SUSAN," Aww, that's too bad.",128
10865,GEORGE, Really?,128
10866,JERRY," Yeah, we'll do it another time.",128
10867,SUSAN,"  George, we'll go.",128
10868,GEORGE," I, uh, oh, broke a shoelace today.",128
10869,SUSAN," Oh, I can get you shoelaces tomorrow.",128
10870,GEORGE, Okay.,128
10871,SUSAN," So, what colour?",128
10872,GEORGE, Brown.,128
10873,GEORGE, Maybe a black.,128
10874,SUSAN, Mmm.,128
10875,WAITRESS, More coffee?,128
10876,GEORGE,  No! Check!  Please.,128
10877,JERRY,  That nut is always up to something.,128
10878,KRAMER, HEY!! Sh..! Shii! MAMA!!,128
10879,KRAMER, AAH! AAGH!,128
10880,PETERMAN," Elaine. I think I've been working you a little too hard, lately.",128
10881,ELAINE,  Oh.,128
10882,PETERMAN," So, I have two tickets for you  to the Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.",128
10883,ELAINE,  Ah.,128
10884,PETERMAN, It is a real hoot.,128
10885,ELAINE,"  Well, thank you Mr Peterman.",128
10886,PETERMAN," Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a little early, so you both can get ready.",128
10887,ELAINE," Mr Peterman, you...",128
10888,PETERMAN,"  There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every word you said.",128
10889,PETERMAN, And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap.  That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.,128
10890,ELAINE,"  Of course, Mr Peterman.",128
10891,JERRY,"  Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye.  Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!",128
10892,JERRY,"  Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!",128
10893,GEORGE," It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.",128
10894,JERRY,"  Uhh, I don't think so.",128
10895,GEORGE,  Why not?,128
10896,JERRY,"  Ah, I'm a little turned off.",128
10897,GEORGE,"  C'mon, what're you talking about?",128
10898,JERRY," Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured.",128
10899,GEORGE, You're soured?,128
10900,JERRY," Yeah, I'm soured.",128
10901,GEORGE, Don't be soured.,128
10902,JERRY, I'm sorry. I'm soured.,128
10903,GEORGE,  What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?,128
10904,JERRY," Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.",128
10905,GEORGE,  What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.,128
10906,JERRY,"  Yeah, we'll see.",128
10907,GEORGE,"  Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?",128
10908,JERRY, I'll try and de-sour.,128
10909,GEORGE,"  Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!",128
10910,JERRY,  I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.,128
10911,GEORGE, I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.,128
10912,JERRY, I still don't know what that means.,128
10913,GEORGE,"  Yeah, well.",128
10914,KRAMER, God.,128
10915,JERRY,  Oh god! What happened to you?!,128
10916,KRAMER,  She tried to kill me Jerry!,128
10917,JERRY, Who?,128
10918,KRAMER,  Connie!,128
10919,JERRY, What'd she do?,128
10920,KRAMER," I don't know!  But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.",128
10921,JERRY,  Why would she try and kill you?,128
10922,KRAMER,"  Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!",128
10923,KRAMER,  Gah!,128
10924,JERRY," Hey, there's uncle Milty.",128
10925,GEORGE,"  Yeah, it is.",128
10926,JERRY,  And there's David Steinberg.,128
10927,GEORGE," The comedian, or the manager?",128
10928,JERRY, The manager.,128
10929,JERRY,"  Hey, there's Pat.  Hey, Pat.",128
10930,PAT," Hey, Jerry. What the hell went wrong? What's the matter with you? Are you a kleptomaniac, or what?",128
10931,JERRY, I forgot to take it off.,128
10932,PAT,"  You forgot to take it off? Oh, you go into a department store, you put a suit on, and you walk right out. What are you some sort of an idiot?",128
10933,JERRY, I'm sorry.,128
10934,PAT, Where's the jacket?,128
10935,JERRY," Well, one of the gypsies took it.",128
10936,PAT,"  Aww, the gypsies took it! Of course, New York has a lot of gypsies! Oh, on every block there's a gypsy!",128
10937,GEORGE,"  Well, it's true. I saw it.",128
10938,PAT,"  Excuse me, are you an entertainer? Are you in showbusiness?",128
10939,GEORGE," No, I uh...",128
10940,PAT,"  Then what am I talking to you for?  Jerry, bring the jacket back tomorrow.",128
10941,JERRY, Alright.,128
10942,GEORGE," Wait a minute, wait a minute.",128
10943,GEORGE, Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.,128
10944,JERRY," God, you're right.",128
10945,GEORGE,  C'mon.,128
10946,JERRY," Well, I'm a prospective member.",128
10947,JERRY, But that guy has my jacket.,128

11019,ELAINE, That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?,129

11269,TELLER, I don't think you can return an item for spite.,129
11270,JERRY, What do you mean?,129
11271,TELLER," Well if there was some problem with the garment. If it were unsatisfactory in some way, then we could do it for you, but I'm afraid spite doesn't fit into any of our conditions for a refund",129
11272,JERRY," That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.",129
11273,TELLER, Let me speak with the manager...excuse me .............Bob!,129

11374,JERRY, I don't think that's it.,13
11375,GEORGE, I'm not kidding.,13
11376,JERRY, What does that mean?,13
11377,ELAINE, I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.,13
11378,JERRY," Oh, he's having a heart attack.",13
11379,GEORGE, Tightness..,13
11380,JERRY, C'mon.,13

11383,GEORGE, Radiating waves of pain..,13
11384,JERRY," I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country.  I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.",13
11385,GEORGE," There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.",13
11386,JERRY,"  He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.",13
11387,GEORGE, Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.,13
11388,JERRY, So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?,13
11389,GEORGE," Manhattan Memorial, less of a line.",13

11398,MAN, Shut up!,13

11403,GEORGE," No, no thanks.",13
11404,JERRY,"  You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?",13
11405,GEORGE," Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.",13
11406,JERRY," Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..",13
11407,GEORGE," Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.",13
11408,JERRY," No, I tried it on. It fits good.",13
11409,GEORGE," Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..",13
11410,JERRY," Well, you know..",13
11411,GEORGE,"  Well, okay.",13
11412,JERRY," Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?",13
11413,GEORGE," Susan Davis?  Hey, wait a second..",13
11414,JERRY," Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.",13
11415,GEORGE, I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?,13
11416,JERRY," You know, if your future was a little more certain..",13
11417,GEORGE," Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished.  It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.",13
11418,JERRY," Well, ah..  What? Kind of like this? ",13

11420,ELAINE, Jerry!,13
11421,JERRY,"  Elaine, what are you doing here? ",13
11422,GEORGE,  Jerk off.,13
11423,JERRY,  There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.,13
11424,ELAINE," Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?",13
11425,GEORGE," I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger..  Hey, is anybody listening?!",13
11426,DOCTOR,"  Uh, hello.  Uh, Mr. Costanza?",13
11427,GEORGE,"  Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.",13
11428,DOCTOR," Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.",13
11429,GEORGE,"  Oh God, Mommy!",13
11430,DOCTOR, And you simply haven't had a heart attack.,13
11431,GEORGE,"  I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.",13
11432,JERRY,"  Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?",13
11433,DOCTOR," No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.",13
11434,GEORGE," Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.",13
11435,DOCTOR," Well, I wouldn't go that far.",13
11436,GEORGE,  What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!,13
11437,DOCTOR, Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?,13
11438,GEORGE," My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.",13
11439,DOCTOR," Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.",13
11440,GEORGE, Really?,13
11441,ELAINE,  Whose tonsils grow back? ,13
11442,DOCTOR, It happens.,13
11443,JERRY," Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.",13
11444,ELAINE," I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.",13
11445,DOCTOR," That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.",13
11446,JERRY,"  Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.",13
11447,GEORGE,  Excuse me!,13
11448,DOCTOR," Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.",13
11449,GEORGE, What? You mean with a knife?,13
11450,DOCTOR," Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.",13
11451,GEORGE,"  Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.",13
11452,DOCTOR, Think about it.  Excuse me.,13
11453,ELAINE,"  Oh, I'm sorry.  I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. ",13
11454,JERRY, Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.,13
11455,KRAMER, Hey.,13
11456,JERRY, Hey.,13
11457,KRAMER," Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital!  So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.",13
11458,JERRY,  Kramer.,13
11459,KRAMER," The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.",13
11460,JERRY," Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.",13
11461,KRAMER, No? That's good.,13
11462,GEORGE, I have to have my tonsils taken out.,13
11463,KRAMER," Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.",13
11464,JERRY,  It's routine surgery.,13
11465,KRAMER," Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, ""My name is Bob"" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..",13
11466,GEORGE," Well, what should I do, Kramer?",13
11467,JERRY," Well, for one think, don't listen to him.",13
11468,KRAMER," I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.",13
11469,JERRY, Eckman? I thought he was doing time?,13
11470,KRAMER," No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.",13
11471,JERRY," A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.",13
11472,KRAMER," He's holistic, George. He's holistic.",13
11473,GEORGE, Holistic.. that sounds right.,13
11474,JERRY," George, you need a medical doctor.",13
11475,GEORGE,  Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?,13
11476,JERRY," Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.",13
11477,GEORGE, Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?,13
11478,KRAMER, First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.,13
11479,GEORGE," Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.",13
11480,GEORGE," So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?",13
11481,JERRY," Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.",13
11482,GEORGE," All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.",13
11483,JERRY,  I've never had a really good pickle.,13
11484,GEORGE," Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?",13
11485,TOR,  Would you not put your foot on that please?,13
11486,JERRY, Sorry.,13
11487,TOR, What month were you born?,13
11488,GEORGE, April.,13
11489,TOR, You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait.,13
11490,GEORGE, Really?,13
11491,TOR, Do you use hot water in the shower?,13
11492,GEORGE, Yes.,13
11493,TOR, Stop using it.,13
11494,GEORGE, ..Okay.,13
11495,KRAMER, I'm off hot water.,13
11496,TOR, Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.,13
11497,GEORGE," Yes, yes I am.",13
11498,TOR,"  I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs customers. And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.",13
11499,GEORGE,  Can I use hot water on my face?,13
11500,TOR," No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer.",13
11501,JERRY,"  And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.",13
11502,GEORGE,  What about shaving?,13
11503,TOR,  You're eating too much dairy.  May I? ,13
11504,GEORGE, I guess so.,13
11505,TOR,"  You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and invasion of heat and wind.",13
11506,JERRY,  There's some hot air blowing in here..,13
11507,TOR," You know, I lived with the Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into the snow.",13
11508,GEORGE,  Could it be lukewarm?,13

11570,JERRY," I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. ""Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life."" Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, ""I had a heart attack this big  ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear!  Brrhht.. and it's gone!""",13
11571,GEORGE," I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors......",130
11572,MR. STEINBRENNER, All the way to the floor! What are you crazy! You'd suffocate in there. Your lucky you have any doors at all. You know when I was in the army...... Hey Costanza. What's that your eating over there? It looks pretty tasty.,130
11573,GEORGE," It's a calzone, sir.",130

11579,ELAINE, He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.,130
11580,JERRY, Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.,130
11581,ELAINE, That's what I said.,130
11582,JERRY, So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?,130
11583,ELAINE, Yeah.,130
11584,JERRY, Huh.,130
11585,ELAINE, What?,130
11586,JERRY, No. nothing.,130
11587,JERRY, What's with you?,130
11588,KRAMER, Feel this.,130
11589,JERRY, Wow.That's hot.,130
11590,KRAMER, Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants.,130
11591,ELAINE, I'll see you later.,130
11592,KRAMER, Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer.,130
11593,JERRY, So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.,130
11594,KRAMER," Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later?",130
11595,JERRY, I got a date with Nikki.,130

11597,JERRY, She's also quite bold.,130
11598,KRAMER, Oh bold and beautiful.,130
11599,MR. STEINBRENNER, I am loving this calzone. The pita pocket prevents it from dripping. The pita pocket. What is it Watson? A lost and found. No. I don't think we need that. If people keel over because they lost something that's there tough luck. You got a drip on your mouth by the way.,130
11600,GEORGE, You know a lost and found could be a good idea.,130
11601,MR. STEINBRENNER, Hold on Watson. You like lost and found George?,130
11602,GEORGE, Definitely.,130
11603,MR. STEINBRENNER, All right lost and found. But these got to be a time limit. We're not running a pawn shop here.,130
11604,JERRY," Hey, Elaine.",130
11605,ELAINE, Hi Jerry!,130
11606,JERRY, This is Nikki.,130

11609,JERRY, Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.,130
11610,ELAINE, So what movie are you guys seeing?,130
11611,NIKKI,"""Means to an End""",130
11612,ELAINE," Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see""Blame it on the Rain""",130
11613,JERRY, Why don't you see what you can do?,130
11614,NIKKI, Okay.,130
11615,ELAINE, What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.,130
11616,JERRY, We'll see.,130
11617,TODD, Hey Jerry. Do you like cigars?,130
11618,JERRY, Yeah. Why?,130
11619,TODD, I am going to Montreal tomorrow and they sell them dirt cheap.,130
11620,JERRY," Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.",130
11621,TODD, So do you want a box?,130
11622,JERRY, Sure. If there cheap Why not.,130
11623,TODD, All right I buy a box and give to Elaine.,130
11624,NIKKI," Okay two tickets""Means to an End""",130
11625,JERRY, Told you.,130
11626,ELAINE, How did you do that?,130
11627,NIKKI, I just talked to the manager.,130
11628,JERRY," All right. Enjoy""Blame it on the Rain""",130
11629,GEORGE, There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.,130
11630,JERRY, There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.,130
11631,GEORGE, Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.,130
11632,JERRY, With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.,130
11633,GEORGE, So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.,130
11634,JERRY, So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.,130
11635,GEORGE, Not bills.,130
11636,JERRY, So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.,130
11637,GEORGE, Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.,130
11638,JERRY, She's like a beautiful Godzilla.,130
11639,GEORGE, Without thousands of fleeing Japanese.,130
11640,KRAMER, Hey buddy.,130
11641,JERRY, What the hell is all this?,130
11642,KRAMER, I am looking for quarters for the dryer.,130
11643,JERRY, Why can't you do this on your table?,130
11644,KRAMER, Because I don't have a table.,130
11645,ELAINE, Hey.,130
11646,JERRY," Hey. So how was""Blame it on the Rain?""",130
11647,ELAINE, Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.,130
11648,JERRY, Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?,130
11649,ELAINE, No. We were both in the mood for one.,130
11650,JERRY," You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....",130
11651,ELAINE, Oh is that so.,130
11652,JERRY, Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.,130
11653,ELAINE, What are you talking about?,130
11654,JERRY, Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner,130
11655,ELAINE, If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.,130
11656,JERRY, Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.,130
11657,ELAINE, I don't buy it.,130
11658,JERRY, So what happened after the movie?,130
11659,ELAINE, Nothing. He walked me home.,130
11660,JERRY, To the door?,130
11661,ELAINE, Yeah.,130
11662,JERRY, That's a date.,130
11663,ELAINE, No it's not.,130
11664,JERRY, But I never walk you home.,130
11665,ELAINE, That's just because your a jackass.,130
11666,KRAMER, Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?,130
11667,JERRY," No, no.",130
11668,ELAINE," No, no.",130
11669,JERRY, So how did you leave it with him?,130
11670,ELAINE, I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.,130
11671,JERRY, That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.,130
11672,ELAINE, Your crazy!,130
11673,JERRY, Crazy like a man.,130
11674,WORKER, Number 49.,130
11675,GEORGE, You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!,130
11676,WORKER, $ 6.50 your change.,130
11677,GEORGE, And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. ,130
11678,WORKER, Hey! You steal my money!!,130
11679,GEORGE, No no. That's not what I was trying to do.,130
11680,WORKER, I know what you try to do. Get out. Don't ever come back ever.,130
11681,GEORGE, I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner.,130
11682,MR. STEINBRENNER, Beautiful. I am starving George.,130
11683,GEORGE, I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.,130
11684,MR. STEINBRENNER, Corn beef. I don't think so. It is a little fatty.,130
11685,GEORGE, How about Chinese?,130
11686,MR. STEINBRENNER," Uhhhhh. No. Too many containers. Big mess, big mess. Too sloppy.I want to stick with the calzones from Pisano's. That's the ticket.",130
11687,GEORGE, I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.,130
11688,MR. STEINBRENNER," No, no, no. George let me tell you something. When I find something I like I stick with it. From 1973 to 1982 I ate the exact same lunch everyday. Turkey chili in a bowl made out of bread. Bread bowl George. First you eat the chili then you eat the bowl. There's nothing more satisfying than looking down after lunch and seeing nothing but a table.",130
11689,ELAINE, Thanks for the dinner.,130
11690,TODD, Well I had to give these cigars and we were both hungry.,130
11691,ELAINE, Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?,130
11692,TODD, What?,130
11693,ELAINE, I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?,130
11694,TODD, Elaine that was a legitimate bet and I lost so I bought you dinner.,130
11695,ELAINE," Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight.",130
11696,TODD," Hey, if your not doing anything Saturday do you want to meet somewhere?",130
11697,ELAINE, See what is that? Is that a date?,130
11698,TODD, Why can't two people go and do something without it being a date?,130
11699,ELAINE, All right. I am sorry it's not a date.,130
11700,TODD, No way. So I'll see you Saturday night?,130
11701,ELAINE, All right.,130
11702,TODD, Pick you up at 8,130
11703,POLICE OFFICER, Do you know what the posted speed limit on this road is?,130
11704,JERRY, I was got to be 55.,130
11705,POLICE OFFICER, That's right it is. Do you know how fast you were going?,130
11706,JERRY, A lot faster than that!,130
11707,POLICE OFFICER, Step out of the car sir.,130
11708,JERRY, Okay dokey,130
11709,POLICE OFFICER, Can I have your license and registration please?,130
11710,JERRY, Absolutely. Nikki!,130
11711,NIKKI, Yes.,130
11712,JERRY, Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?,130
11713,NIKKI, Not at all.,130
11714,POLICE OFFICER, I got you on the radar at 93 miles per hour.,130
11715,JERRY, You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.,130
11716,NIKKI, Officer. Hi. Do you really have to give us a ticket?,130
11717,JERRY, All right Nik. That's it.,130
11718,KRAMER, Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.,130
11719,JERRY, You got your shirt in my oven!?!,130
11720,KRAMER, I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.,130
11721,JERRY, For both of us.,130
11722,KRAMER, And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.,130
11723,JERRY, What's wrong with your oven?,130
11724,KRAMER, I am baking a pie!,130
11725,JERRY, Yeah.,130
11726,GEORGE, Yeah.,130
11727,JERRY, Come on up.,130
11728,KRAMER," You got cigars, huh.",130
11729,JERRY, I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!,130
11730,KRAMER," Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?""Perducto de Peru""Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.",130
11731,JERRY, Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!,130
11732,KRAMER, You got ripped buddy.,130
11733,JERRY, I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.,130
11734,KRAMER, That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch?  Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma. Hey George hey.,130
11735,GEORGE, Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.,130
11736,JERRY, so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?,130
11737,GEORGE, What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.,130
11738,JERRY, Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?,130
11739,GEORGE, Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.,130
11740,JERRY, No. I never had a job.,130
11741,KRAMER, I decided to go with the brown one 's. ,130
11742,GEORGE, What the hell is this?,130
11743,JERRY, Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.,130
11744,GEORGE, There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.,130
11745,KRAMER, Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?,130
11746,GEORGE, Yeah. You've heard of it?,130
11747,KRAMER, Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.,130
11748,GEORGE, I'll see you guys later.,130
11749,JERRY, What kind of pie are you cooking?,130
11750,KRAMER, Huckleberry.,130
11751,NEWMAN, You certainly are in a bind.,130
11752,GEORGE, Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.,130
11753,NEWMAN, Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.,130
11754,GEORGE, Are you going to help me or not?,130
11755,NEWMAN," All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.",130
11756,GEORGE, What?,130
11757,NEWMAN, Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....,130
11758,GEORGE, All right.,130
11759,NEWMAN, And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.,130
11760,GEORGE, That's a little steep don't you think?,130
11761,NEWMAN, You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.,130
11762,GEORGE," All right, all right.",130
11763,NEWMAN, Do we have a deal?,130
11764,GEORGE, But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.,130
11765,NEWMAN," I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.",130
11766,ELAINE, This is nice.,130
11767,TODD, Gack. Party of four.,130
11768,ELAINE, Party of four? Who are we meeting?,130
11769,TODD, Mom! Dad! This is Elaine.,130
11770,MOM, Hello.,130

11779,ELAINE," Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.",130
11780,TODD, Why is this a date?,130
11781,ELAINE, Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.,130
11782,TODD, Elaine. I don't understand why you can't meet someone else's parents without classifying it as a date.,130
11783,ELAINE, Well if it's not a date then what is it?,130
11784,TODD, It's a lovely evening together.,130
11785,ELAINE, I don't believe this.,130
11786,TODD, Well I am getting a cab want to join me?,130
11787,ELAINE, No. I'll just walk home.,130
11788,TODD, Okay goodnight. ,130

11790,NEWMAN, Hello. What 's this?,130
11791,GEORGE, Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?,130
11792,NEWMAN, Work? It's raining.,130
11793,GEORGE, Soooooo,130
11794,NEWMAN, I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.,130
11795,GEORGE," You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman.""Neither rain nor sleet nor snow.....""It's the first one.",130
11796,NEWMAN, I was never that big on creeds.,130
11797,GEORGE, You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!,130
11798,NEWMAN, I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.,130
11799,GEORGE, But I'm paying you!,130
11800,NEWMAN, Yes thank you. ,130
11801,GEORGE, Newman!!,130
11802,NIKKI, Peru? I thought you wanted cigars from Cuba?,130
11803,JERRY, I did.,130
11804,NIKKI, Well if these aren't what you wanted then why did you pay him?,130
11805,JERRY, Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.,130
11806,NIKKI, Okay.,130
11807,GEORGE, Kramer!,130
11808,KRAMER, Hey you!,130
11809,GEORGE, Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.,130
11810,KRAMER, What happened to Newman?,130
11811,GEORGE, He called in sick.,130
11812,KRAMER, Oh yeah right it's raining.,130
11813,GEORGE, Can you do it?,130
11814,KRAMER, What time do you need it at?,130
11815,GEORGE, 1,130
11816,KRAMER, No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.,130
11817,KRAMER, Hey hold that bus!,130
11818,KRAMER, Hey. It's really wet out there.,130
11819,WORKER, What can I get you?,130
11820,KRAMER, I here you make a pretty mean calzone.,130
11821,WORKER, Calzone!,130
11822,KRAMER, Yeah calzone.,130
11823,WORKER, The best!,130
11824,KRAMER, All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.,130
11825,WORKER, Three calzones.,130
11826,KRAMER, Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.,130
11827,ELAINE, Hey Todd.,130
11828,TODD, Hi. You know Nikki.,130
11829,ELAINE, Yeah sure.,130
11830,NIKKI," Wait. Elaine will settle this. What's the""M""stand for in Richard M. Nixon?",130
11831,ELAINE, Milhouse.,130
11832,NIKKI, I told you so. He said it was Moe. You owe me a dinner.,130
11833,WORKER, Your order is ready. Three calzones and one shirt and jacket.,130
11834,KRAMER, Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.,130
11835,WORKER, What the hell do I know about cooking a shirt? What the hell is this? Your paying in pennies?,130
11836,KRAMER, That's all I got.,130
11837,WORKER, No. You have to have bills. Paper money. You can't pay with this.,130
11838,KRAMER, I told you this is all I got.,130
11839,WORKER, Then no calzones.,130
11840,GEORGE, What happened? Where have you been?,130
11841,KRAMER, The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.,130
11842,GEORGE, What the hell happened to your shirt?,130
11843,KRAMER, He overcooked it. It's ruined.,130
11844,GEORGE, Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.,130
11845,MR. STEINBRENNER,  That's right. Do you want to say it again. I'll say it again. I hadn't had a pimple since I was eighteen and I don't care that you don't believe me or not. And how's this. Your fired. Okay your not. I am just a little hungry. Where's Costanza with my calzone. It's 1,130
11846,JERRY, Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.,130
11847,ELAINE, These are terrible.,130
11848,JERRY, It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.,130
11849,ELAINE, What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.,130
11850,JERRY, I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.,130
11851,ELAINE, Where are you going?,130
11852,JERRY, I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.,130
11853,ELAINE, But she broke up with you.,130
11854,JERRY," I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.",130
11855,ELAINE, It smells like a rubber fire.,130
11856,JERRY,What's that?,130
11857,ELAINE, I said rubber fire.,130
11858,JERRY, Oh.,130
11859,ELAINE, Did you ever pay Todd for these things?,130
11860,JERRY, Actually it's being taken care of right now.,130
11861,KRAMER, You Gack?,130
11862,TODD, Yeah.,130
11863,KRAMER, Here's your money.,130
11864,MR. STEINBRENNER, George. Why do these clothes smell like Pisano's?,130
11865,GEORGE, Because they were heated up there.,130
11866,MR. STEINBRENNER, Heating up your clothes? That's not a bad idea.,130
11867,JERRY,"I love it when you get your car back from the car place, and it's got that paper mat on the floor. Like they're so obsessed with cleanliness, they don't even want their shoes to touch the carpet. Meanwhile, the mechanic comes out; he looks like Al Jolson. He's covered in goo, from head to toe. You can't even see him. Although, I prefer that to when they have the lab coat, The clipboard and the nice glasses. Now you know you're getting screwed.  'Can I see it?'  'You better not. It's idling quietly right now. I think it should stay overnight. We wanna keep an eye on it, and we wanna keep the bill running up.'",131
11868,WILHELM, And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for the cigarettes and the dive checks.,131
11869,GEORGE," Sorry, the players will be reimbursed?",131
11870,WILHELM," The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat myself.",131
11871,GEORGE," Sorry, Mr Wilhelm.",131
11872,WILHELM," Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here George. You've got to pay attention.",131
11873,GEORGE," I know, sir. It won't happen again.",131
11874,WILHELM," Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh.",131
11875,WILHELM, Lemme think here.,131
11876,PETERMAN, Elaine.,131
11877,ELAINE," Hi, Mr Peterman.",131
11878,PETERMAN, You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.,131
11879,ELAINE, I do.,131
11880,PETERMAN, It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business.  Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.,131
11881,ELAINE, The pygmy pullover.,131
11882,PETERMAN," Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. To me, they capture that indefinable romance that was Camelot.",131
11883,ELAINE, Whatever.,131
11884,PETERMAN," But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend and therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in my stead.",131
11885,ELAINE," Oh.  Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing?  I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?",131
11886,PETERMAN," I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque.",131
11887,ELAINE, Wow.,131
11888,WILHELM," ...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr Steinbrenner is very interested in this.",131
11889,GEORGE," Yes, sir.",131
11890,WILHELM,"  Yes, George. I want you to make this project a top priority.",131
11891,GEORGE," I will, sir. Top priority.",131
11892,WILHELM,  Top priority.,131
11893,GEORGE, Top priority.,131
11894,GEORGE," So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.",131
11895,JERRY, He pulled an LBJ on you.,131
11896,GEORGE, LBJ?,131
11897,JERRY," Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.",131
11898,GEORGE, No kidding?,131
11899,JERRY, Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.,131
11900,GEORGE," Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.",131
11901,JERRY, Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.,131
11902,GEORGE," I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.",131
11903,JERRY," You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.",131
11904,GEORGE," Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work.",131
11905,KRAMER, Hey buddy.,131
11906,JERRY, Hey.,131
11907,GEORGE, Hey.,131
11908,JERRY, Can I have my keys...,131
11909,KRAMER,  Yeah.,131
11910,JERRY,"  ...back, please?",131
11911,KRAMER," You shoulda come, Jerry.",131
11912,NEWMAN, We made quite a haul.,131
11913,GEORGE, Where'd you go?,131
11914,KRAMER, Price club.,131
11915,GEORGE, Why didn't you take your car?,131
11916,KRAMER," Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.",131
11917,KRAMER, What're you doing.  Don't throw that away.,131
11918,NEWMAN," Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.",131
11919,KRAMER," You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here.  Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund,  vrrup, five cents.",131
11920,NEWMAN,  Refund?,131
11921,KRAMER, Yes.,131
11922,JERRY," Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?",131
11923,NEWMAN," I don't know, they're deranged.",131
11924,GEORGE," Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?",131
11925,JERRY, No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.,131
11926,GEORGE," Awright, I'll see you later.",131
11927,NEWMAN,"  What is this 'MI, ten cents'?",131
11928,KRAMER, That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.,131
11929,NEWMAN, Ten cents!?,131
11930,KRAMER, Yeah.,131
11931,NEWMAN," Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.",131
11932,KRAMER," No, it doesn't work.",131
11933,NEWMAN, What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...,131
11934,KRAMER," Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.",131
11935,JERRY,"  Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?",131
11936,KRAMER," No, no, I'm off that.",131
11937,NEWMAN, You tried it?,131
11938,KRAMER, Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.,131
11939,JERRY,  You two keep an eye on each other?,131
11940,JERRY, Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.,131
11941,ELAINE," No, I didn't hear anything.  Oh, my God, look who's here.",131
11942,JERRY," Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.",131
11943,SUE ELLEN, Well. Hello Elaine. Jerry.,131
11944,ELAINE, Hi Sue Ellen.,131
11945,JERRY, Hi Sue Ellen.,131
11946,SUE ELLEN, I'm surprised to see you here. Come to catch a glimpse of high society?,131
11947,ELAINE,"  Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.",131
11948,JERRY, I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.,131
11949,SUE ELLEN," Well, I hope you find something that fits your budget.",131
11950,ELAINE,  I... hate that woman.,131
11951,NEWMAN, I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler?,131
11952,KRAMER," No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.",131
11953,NEWMAN, I wanna learn. I want to know why.,131
11954,ELAINE,"  Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.",131
11955,AUCTIONEER," Lot number seven forty-five. We have a full set of golf clubs, that were owned by President John F Kennedy, as seen in the famous photograph of the president chipping at Burning Tree on the morning of the Bay of Pigs invasion.

11956,AUCTIONEER, I have four thousand dollars. Do I have five?  Five thousand dollars. I have five thousand dollars. Do I have six? Six thousand dollars for this set of beautiful clubs.  Six. I have six thousand dollars. Can I have sixty-five hundred?,131

11958,AUCTIONEER, The president's own golf clubs. Leisure life at Camelot. Sixty-five hundred going once...,131

11976,ELAINE,  Fifteen thousand!!,131
11977,ELAINE, Peterman is gonna kill me.,131
11978,JERRY, I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.,131
11979,ELAINE, Why didn't you stop me?,131
11980,JERRY, Do you hear this clunking?,131
11981,ELAINE,  A little.,131
11982,ELAINE," Oh. You know what?  I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.",131
11983,JERRY, Okay.,131
11984,ELAINE," Alrighty, bye.",131

11986,JERRY, What's going on here?,131
11987,JERRY, Oh God!,131
11988,JERRY,"  Oh, you idiots!",131
11989,NEWMAN," So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?",131
11990,KRAMER," Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon.  Hey, there he is.",131
11991,JERRY, Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?,131
11992,KRAMER,"  Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.",131
11993,NEWMAN,  That's where my missing soda is.,131
11994,JERRY," And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?",131
11995,KRAMER, We ran outta space.,131
11996,JERRY, Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.,131
11997,KRAMER," Ah, Tony, he's good.",131
11998,JERRY," Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.",131
11999,KRAMER,  'Choke?',131
12000,JERRY," No, thank you.",131
12001,TONY,"  Oh, yeah. I remember this car. Beautiful car.",131
12002,JERRY," Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...",131
12003,JERRY, There's really nothing wrong on the inside.,131
12004,TONY," Well, the shift knob is loose. You know about that?",131
12005,JERRY," No, I hadn't noticed.",131
12006,TONY,  Have you been picking at it?,131
12007,JERRY, Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.,131
12008,TONY,  Wear and tear. I see.,131
12009,JERRY, The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.,131
12010,TONY, You been rotating the tires?,131
12011,JERRY, Try to.,131
12012,TONY,  You don't try to. You do it! Fifty-one percent of all turns are right turns. You know that? 'Try to.',131
12013,PETERMAN," Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend.",131
12014,ELAINE," I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them.  You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...",131
12015,PETERMAN," Well, where are they?",131
12016,ELAINE,  They should be here today.,131
12017,GEORGE," Uh, Mr Wilhelm.",131

12019,GEORGE," Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment.",131
12020,WILHELM," Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know.",131
12021,GEORGE," Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?",131
12022,WILHELM,"  Get started? I don't understand, George.",131
12023,GEORGE," Well, I was wondering...",131
12024,WILHELM, You mean you haven't been to payroll?,131
12025,GEORGE," Payroll? No, no, I haven't done that.",131
12026,WILHELM," Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down!",131
12027,GEORGE, Payroll!!,131
12028,GEORGE, Hello there. I'm George Costanza.,131
12029,CLERK, Yes?,131
12030,GEORGE," Assistant to the travelling secretary.  I'm uh, working on the project.",131
12031,CLERK, What project?,131
12032,GEORGE," Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.",131
12033,CLERK, You're gonna have to fill me in.,131
12034,GEORGE," You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while.  I'll just browse around.",131
12035,CLERK,"  Hey, wait, hey. Excuse me, uh, you can't come back here.",131
12036,GEORGE," Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.",131
12037,CLERK," Well, maybe I will.",131
12038,GEORGE,"  You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here.  Then you can tell me.",131
12039,CLERK,"  Mr Wilhelm, uh, this is Lafarge in payroll. Uh, there's a Costanza here, says he's working on some project?",131
12040,CLERK,"  Oh.  Oh, I see.  Interesting.  Well, that's quite a project. Alright, thank you.",131
12041,CLERK,"  Ah, I'm sorry uh, that I doubted you. Whatever you need, just uh, make yourself at home.",131
12042,GEORGE, So he explained it all to you?,131
12043,CLERK," Yes, he explained it all very clearly.",131
12044,GEORGE, What'd he tell you?,131
12045,CLERK,"  Look! You were right, I was wrong! You don't have to humiliate me about it, alright!",131

12052,NEWMAN," It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!",131
12053,KRAMER," Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.",131
12054,NEWMAN," No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan.",131
12055,KRAMER,  Uh-huh.,131
12056,NEWMAN," But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.",131
12057,KRAMER,  Mother's Day.,131
12058,NEWMAN, The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.,131
12059,KRAMER," A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.",131
12060,NEWMAN,"  We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!",131
12061,KRAMER," Newman, you magnificent bastard, you did it!",131
12062,NEWMAN,  Let the collecting begin!,131
12063,WILHELM, So...,131
12064,WILHELM, ...did you go down to payroll?,131
12065,GEORGE,"  Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.",131
12066,WILHELM,"  Well then, I guess you'll be heading downtown then, huh?",131
12067,GEORGE," Oh, yeah. Downtown. Definitely.",131
12068,WILHELM," Well, I'm very interested to see how this thing turns out.",131
12069,GEORGE,"  Yeah, you said it.  Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?",131
12070,WILHELM," Oh no, you've got to go downtown, George. It's all downtown. Just like the song says.",131
12071,GEORGE, The song?,131
12072,WILHELM, There's your answer. Downtown.,131
12073,GEORGE,  Downtown.,131
12074,JERRY, The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?,131
12075,GEORGE, Yeah.,131
12076,JERRY, You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?,131
12077,GEORGE," I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.",131
12078,JERRY," Okay, so how does it go?",131
12079,GEORGE," 'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'",131
12080,JERRY, '... downtown.',131
12081,GEORGE," 'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'",131
12082,JERRY, '...downtown.',131
12083,GEORGE," Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?",131
12084,JERRY, Seven-eleven?,131
12085,GEORGE," 'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?",131
12086,JERRY," No, that's midtown.",131
12087,GEORGE," 'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'",131
12088,JERRY, '...down town.',131
12089,GEORGE," 'Things'll be great, when you're...'",131
12090,JERRY, '...downtown.',131
12091,GEORGE," I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing.",131
12092,JERRY," Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'",131
12093,GEORGE," You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?",131
12094,JERRY, How can you lose?,131
12095,TONY ," Yeah, Jerry, it's Tony Abato at the shop. Look, we gotta talk. You better come down, any time after four.",131
12096,JERRY, Hello.,131
12097,ELAINE," Hi, it's me.",131
12098,JERRY," Oh, hi.",131
12099,ELAINE," Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.",131
12100,JERRY," Oh, you know what?",131
12101,ELAINE,  Oh no. What?,131
12102,JERRY," Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.",131
12103,ELAINE, You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?,131
12104,JERRY, I forgot.,131
12105,ELAINE," Oh, go down and get them.",131
12106,JERRY, I can't. The car's at the mechanics.,131
12107,ELAINE," Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.",131
12108,JERRY," No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?",131
12109,ELAINE,"  Ugh, okay, alright, fine.",131
12110,JERRY," Hey, Tony.",131
12111,TONY," Thanks for coming in, Jerry.",131
12112,JERRY, Sure.,131
12113,TONY," I think I know what's goin' on here, and I just wanna hear it from you. But I want you to be straight with me. Don't lie to me, Jerry. You know that motor oil you're puttin' in there?  From one of those quicky lube places, isn't it?",131
12114,JERRY," Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...",131
12115,TONY," Jerry, motor oil is the lifeblood of a car. Okay, you put in a low-grade oil, you could damage vital engine parts. Okay.  See this gasket?  I have no confidence in that gasket.",131
12116,JERRY, I really wanna...,131
12117,TONY," Here's what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul the entire engine. But it's gonna take a major commitment from you. You're gonna have to keep it under sixty miles an hour for a while. You gotta come in, and you gotta get the oil changed every thousand miles.",131
12118,JERRY, How much money is this gonna cost me?,131
12119,TONY,"  Huh. I don't understand you. It's your own car we're talking about. You know you wrote the wrong mileage down on the form? You barely know the car. You don't know the mileage, you don't know the tyre pressure. When was the last time you even checked the washer fluid?",131
12120,JERRY, The washer fluid is fine.,131
12121,TONY,  The washer fluid is not fine!,131
12122,JERRY," Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.",131
12123,TONY, What d'you mean?,131
12124,JERRY," Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.",131
12125,TONY," Well, the car's on a lift.",131
12126,JERRY," Well, just get it down.",131
12127,TONY,"  Alright. Okay. Well, uhm, wait here and I'll uh, I'll bring it around.",131
12128,JERRY," Okay. Thank you, very much.",131
12129,ELAINE, Hey. Where's the car?,131
12130,JERRY, He's bringing it.,131
12131,ELAINE, Good.,131
12132,JERRY , Last week on Seinfeld.,132
12133,JERRY," Okay, thank you. ",132
12134,ELAINE, So? What'd they say?,132
12135,JERRY, They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.,132
12136,ELAINE, What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!,132
12137,JERRY," Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?",132
12138,ELAINE, What kind of maniac is this guy?,132
12139,JERRY, He's a very special maniac.,132
12140,ELAINE, What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.,132
12141,JERRY, I don't know.,132
12142,ELAINE, Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!,132
12143,PETERMAN," Well, are they here?",132
12144,ELAINE," Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.",132
12145,PETERMAN, Snag?,132
12146,ELAINE, It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.,132
12147,PETERMAN, What does that have to do with my clubs?,132
12148,ELAINE, They happened to be in the back seat at the time.,132
12149,DETECTIVE, What was the suspect wearing at the time of the incident?,132
12150,JERRY," You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?",132
12151,DETECTIVE," All the time. A mechanic forms an emotional attachment, thinks he'sgonna lose the car, he panics, he does something rash. I'm gonna ask you somepersonal questions. I'm sorry if I touch a nerve, but I think it'll help with the case. Had you been taking good care of the car?",132
12152,JERRY, Had I been taking...?,132
12153,DETECTIVE," Well, did you leave the A/C on? Do you zip over speed bumps? Do you ride the clutch? Things like that.",132
12154,JERRY," W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.",132
12155,JERRY, Not that I would think of doing such things.,132
12156,DETECTIVE,"  Alright Mr Seinfeld, we'll let you know if we find anything. I gotta be honest with you, these cases never end up well.",132
12157,JERRY," Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks.",132
12158,GEORGE,"  Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...",132
12159,WILHELM, That's what I came to talk to you about. Great job George.  You really nailed it.,132
12160,GEORGE, I did?,132
12161,WILHELM," Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work George.",132
12162,JERRY," I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.",132
12163,GEORGE," Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.",132
12164,WILHELM," The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't he dear?",132
12165,MRS WILHELM ," You planted the rose bushes, dear.",132
12166,WILHELM, I did?,132
12167,MRS WILHELM , Yesterday. You remember.,132
12168,WILHELM,  That's right.  What's for dinner?,132
12169,MRS WILHELM , We just ate. Did you forget to take your medicine?,132
12170,GEORGE," The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?",132
12171,JERRY, No. The police have no leads  and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.,132
12172,GEORGE, Why not?,132
12173,JERRY," They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.",132
12174,ELAINE,  Hey.,132
12175,GEORGE, Hey.,132
12176,ELAINE,  Hey. What did the detective say?,132
12177,JERRY, They're looking.,132
12178,GEORGE, I gotta go.,132
12179,JERRY, Y'hello.,132
12180,DETECTIVE , Mr Seinfeld?,132
12181,JERRY, Yeah.,132
12182,DETECTIVE , It's Detective McMahon...,132
12183,DETECTIVE ," ...I'm at the warehouse on Pier 38. Ah, I think you'd better get down here.",132
12184,JERRY," Yeah, okay.  They may have found the car.",132
12185,ELAINE,  Are the clubs in it? Ask him.,132
12186,JERRY, Are there golf clubs in the back?,132
12187,DETECTIVE , We really can't tell. You better bring your service records.,132
12188,YOUNG COP," Watch where you step. There's quite a bit of... grease. Detective, Jerry Seinfeld is here.",132
12189,DETECTIVE, How d'you do. Thanks for coming down.,132
12190,JERRY,  This is Elaine Benes.,132
12191,ELAINE,"  We used to date, but now we're just friends.",132
12192,DETECTIVE, I see.,132
12193,JERRY, Yeah.,132
12194,DETECTIVE," I'm sorry to make you go through this, but we need to make sure.",132
12195,JERRY," Well, what's going on? What is this thing?",132
12196,DETECTIVE, One of our patrolmen stumbled over this.,132
12197,ELAINE,  Huuh! ,132
12198,JERRY, Oh my God!,132
12199,DETECTIVE, The block is nearly split apart. We found the overhead cams thirty feet away. We can only hope the body sold for scrap.,132
12200,ELAINE," Oh, my God.",132
12201,DETECTIVE, And we know it's a Saab. The angle on the Vee-6 is definitely ninety-two. The model is hard to determine because the drive train is all burnt out.,132
12202,JERRY, What is that smell?,132
12203,DETECTIVE, Look at the clutch.,132
12204,ELAINE, Uuh.,132
12205,YOUNG COP, Excuse me.,132
12206,DETECTIVE," Whoever did this didn't just dismantle it. I mean, they took their time, they had fun. They were very systematic. They went out of their way to gouge the sides of every piston, and the turbo was separated from the housing and shoved right up the exhaust pipe.",132
12207,ELAINE, Uhh,132
12208,JERRY, Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.,132
12209,DETECTIVE, Your car's not a turbo?,132
12210,JERRY," No, it's a nine-hundred S.  It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!",132
12211,ELAINE,  It's a tu-hur-bo.,132
12212,WOMAN," Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it...  midnight blue?",132
12213,DETECTIVE,  Yes ma'am.,132
12214,JERRY, Hello.,132
12215,TONY," Hey Jerry, it's Tony.",132
12216,JERRY," Tony, where are you?",132
12217,TONY," Aw look, I just want you to know that the car is fine. I got her all fixed up. We're in a nice area, no potholes, no traffic. So there's nothing to worry about. Okay? In fact, here, somebody wants to talk to you.",132
12218,JERRY," Tony, y-you better bring that car back!",132
12219,TONY,"  Nobody's giving anything back! You tried to take it from me, I don't forget that.",132
12220,JERRY," Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!",132
12221,TONY," Oh, your car. You want your car back!",132
12222,JERRY, Tony.,132
12223,TONY," Listen, that registration may have your name on it, Jerry. But this engine's running on my sweat and my blood.",132
12224,JERRY,  Where do I find these guys?,132
12225,NEWMAN, How much gas we got?,132
12226,KRAMER, Three quarters of a tank.,132
12227,KRAMER, That's better than we estimated.,132
12228,NEWMAN,  That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.,132
12229,NEWMAN," Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.",132
12230,KRAMER," Ah, no, that's not in the budget.",132
12231,NEWMAN," Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment.",132
12232,KRAMER," That's not a good investment, that's a loss.",132
12233,KRAMER," Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate.",132
12234,KRAMER," Yeah, those are New York plates.",132
12235,NEWMAN, Is that Jerry's number?,132
12236,KRAMER," I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.",132
12237,NEWMAN, What're you doing?,132
12238,KRAMER, I'm calling Jerry.,132
12239,NEWMAN, On what?,132
12240,KRAMER, Brought my phone.,132
12241,JERRY,  Y'hello.,132
12242,KRAMER," Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?",132
12243,JERRY," Why, what's up?",132
12244,KRAMER," Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.",132
12245,JERRY," Oh my god, you're kidding.  Hang on a second.  It's JVN 728.",132
12246,KRAMER,"  Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.",132
12247,JERRY," Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.",132
12248,KRAMER, Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.,132
12249,JERRY," Good work Kramer, this is incredible.",132
12250,KRAMER," Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.",132
12251,ELAINE, Elaine Benes.,132
12252,JERRY," Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!",132
12253,ELAINE," Oh my god, where is it?",132
12254,JERRY," It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.",132
12255,ELAINE, Are the clubs there?,132
12256,JERRY, I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.,132
12257,ELAINE," Alright, I'm heading over right now.",132
12258,ELAINE, What's the status?,132
12259,JERRY," Last check-in, they were still on him.",132
12260,ELAINE," Well, have they called the police yet?",132
12261,JERRY," No, they won't call the police.",132
12262,ELAINE, What? Why not?,132
12263,JERRY, They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.,132
12264,ELAINE, Kramer has a record.,132
12265,JERRY, Not a Federal record.,132
12266,JERRY, What's going on?,132
12267,KRAMER," Yeah, nothing. We're still following him.",132
12268,KRAMER," Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five.",132
12269,ELAINE, Keep following him.,132
12270,KRAMER," Alright, alright, I'll follow him.",132
12271,NEWMAN," Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.",132
12272,KRAMER," Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.",132
12273,ELAINE, I need those clubs.,132
12274,JERRY," Kramer, I want my car.",132
12275,KRAMER," Well, I don't know what to do.",132
12276,NEWMAN," Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas.",132
12277,JERRY, Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.,132
12278,NEWMAN," Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it.",132
12279,KRAMER," Well, I don't know what to do man!",132
12280,NEWMAN," Kramer! Stay left. Left, left, left.",132
12281,KRAMER, Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.,132
12282,NEWMAN, I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.,132
12283,KRAMER, This ramp is steep.,132
12284,NEWMAN," All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.",132
12285,KRAMER," Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here.  Take the wheel.",132
12286,NEWMAN, What're you doing?,132
12287,KRAMER,  I'm gonna get something.,132
12288,NEWMAN, Are you crazy?,132
12289,KRAMER, Keep your foot on the gas.,132
12290,NEWMAN," Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?",132
12291,NEWMAN," Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses.",132
12292,KRAMER, Look out below!!,132
12293,STEINBRENNER,"  With this magnifying glass, I feel like a scientist.",132
12294,GEORGE," You wanted to see me, sir?",132
12295,STEINBRENNER," Ah, come in George, come in.",132
12296,STEINBRENNER," Uh, Wilhelm gave me this project you worked on.",132
12297,GEORGE,  Yes sir.,132
12298,STEINBRENNER," Let me ask you something, George. You having any personal problems at home? Girl trouble, love trouble of any kind?",132
12299,GEORGE,  No sir.,132
12300,STEINBRENNER, What about drugs? You doing some of that crack cocaine? You on the pipe?,132
12301,GEORGE,  No sir.,132
12302,STEINBRENNER," Are you seeing a psychiatrist? Bcause I got a flash for you young man, you're non compos mentis! You got some bats in the belfry!",132
12303,GEORGE, What're.. What're you talking about?,132

12305,STEINBRENNER," Okay, come on boys, come on in here. George, this is Herb and Dan.",132
12306,STEINBRENNER," They're gonna take you away to a nice place where you can get some help. They're very friendly people there. My brother-in-law was there for a couple of weeks. The man was obsessed with lactating women. They completely cured him, although he still eats a lot of cheese.",132
12307,GEORGE," Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine.",132
12308,STEINBRENNER, Of course you didn't George. Of course you didn't write it.,132
12309,GEORGE," I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did.",132
12310,STEINBRENNER," Of course. Of course it got done. Things get done all the time, I understand.  Don't worry, your job'll be waiting for you when you get back.  Get better George. Get better!",132

13133,ELAINE, Karate?,135
13134,KRAMER," Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.",135
13135,ELAINE, Katra?,135
13136,KRAMER," Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, ""Yes, I can!""",135

13139,ELAINE," Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.",135
13140,KRAMER, Sure you have.,135
13141,ELAINE," I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.",135
13142,KRAMER," You follow your katra, and you can do anything.  Now get out of here.",135
13143,ELAINE,  Okay.,135

13166,SANSEI, Hydjama! Begin!,135
13167,SANSEI,  Winner!,135
13168,GEORGE, It's open!,135
13169,GEORGE,  Rosses.,135
13170,MRS. ROSS," Hello, George.",135
13171,GEORGE," Well, uh... come in, come, come in. ",135
13172,MR. ROSS," We, uh, tried to call, but the line was busy.",135
13173,GEORGE," Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? ",135
13174,MRS. ROSS, We know the last three months have been hard on you.,135
13175,GEORGE," Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.",135
13176,MR. ROSS," And they've been hard on us, too. It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children.",135
13177,GEORGE," Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.",135
13178,MR. ROSS, That's why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susan's memory.,135
13179,GEORGE," Oh, that's wonderful.",135
13180,MR. ROSS," And, of course, we want you to be an integral part.",135
13181,GEORGE," Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?",135
13182,MR. ROSS, You'll be on the board of directors.,135
13183,GEORGE,"  Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...",135
13184,MRS. ROSS," Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time.",135
13185,GEORGE, I can't believe this is happening.,135
13186,MR. ROSS," Well, it wouldn't have without your friend Jerry's inspirational words. He said to us, ""She's not really dead if her shadow is..."" Uh, w-what was it, dear?",135
13187,MRS. ROSS," Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows?",135
13188,MR. ROSS," Well, what's important is that your relationship with Susan doesn't have to end.",135
13189,MRS. ROSS, So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?,135
13190,GEORGE,  The second I see him.,135
13191,JERRY, Hey.,135
13192,GEORGE," Hey. How's your day, good?",135
13193,JERRY," Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.",135
13194,GEORGE," So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?",135
13195,JERRY, Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?,135
13196,GEORGE, What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?,135
13197,JERRY," No, no, no, it's... ""She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.""",135
13198,GEORGE, That's it. That's the line...  ...that destroyed my life.,135
13199,JERRY,  Problem?,135
13200,GEORGE," The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.",135
13201,JERRY," Hey, board of directors. Look at you!",135
13202,GEORGE," Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!",135
13203,JERRY," Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.",135
13204,GEORGE, Don't you see? I'm back in.,135
13205,JERRY, All because of Wrath of Khan?,135
13206,GEORGE, Yes!,135
13207,JERRY," Well, it was the best of those movies.",135
13208,GEORGE, KHAN!,135
13209,WYCK, George.,135
13210,WYCK, George. ,135
13211,GEORGE,  Oh!,135
13212,WYCK," I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation.",135
13213,GEORGE, Wink.,135
13214,WYCK,  Wyck.,135
13215,GEORGE, Wyck.,135
13216,WYCK," Now, as you know, the Rosses had considerable monies.",135
13217,GEORGE, Oh. I know they have some monies.,135
13218,WYCK," They had more than some monies. Many, many monies. And they planned to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and Susan after the wedding.",135
13219,GEORGE," So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--",135
13220,WYCK, Yes.,135
13221,GEORGE, And now?,135
13222,WYCK," Not. It's all been endowed to the foundation, even this townhouse.",135
13223,GEORGE, This townhouse?,135
13224,WYCK, This would have been your wedding gift.,135
13225,GEORGE, And now?,135
13226,WYCK, Not.,135
13227,GEORGE, Not.,135
13228,WYCK, Also endowed. George... I know how much Susan meant to you. It can't be easy.,135
13229,GEORGE," You know, it really can't.",135
13230,DOLORES, So who broke it off?,135
13231,JERRY," Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.",135
13232,DOLORES," Oh, come on. Everybody knows there's no such thing as a mutual breakup. Tell me the truth.",135
13233,JERRY, I am. It was the world's first.,135
13234,DOLORES," You know, when I heard you got engaged, I thought *maybe* you had matured. But obviously there's no growth here. ",135
13235,JERRY," Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely...  Mulva!",135
13236,JERRY,  Hello?,135
13237,SECRETARY, Please hold for Elaine Benes.,135
13238,JERRY," Oh, I don't believe this.",135
13239,ELAINE,  Jerry!,135
13240,JERRY, Hey!,135
13241,ELAINE, Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.,135
13242,JERRY, How's it look?,135
13243,ELAINE,  It's a peach.,135
13244,JERRY, Huh?,135
13245,ELAINE," I say, it's a peach.",135
13246,JERRY," Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?",135
13247,ELAINE," No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.",135
13248,JERRY, I gotta do some research here.,135
13249,ELAINE," Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.",135
13250,JERRY," Oh, I'm the doofus?",135
13251,ELAINE," Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.",135
13252,JERRY," You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.",135
13253,ELAINE," Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.",135
13254,JERRY," Yeah, that's what I was thinking.",135
13255,ELAINE, Kramer!,135
13256,KRAMER," Oh, hey.",135
13257,ELAINE, What are you doing?,135
13258,KRAMER," Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating.",135
13259,ELAINE, You never said you were fighting children.,135
13260,KRAMER," Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.",135
13261,ELAINE, This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?,135
13262,KRAMER," No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.",135
13263,ELAINE, Search... for Spock?!,135
13264,KRAMER," Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...",135
13265,ELAINE,  You doofus!,135
13266,JERRY," Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.",135
13267,RUTHIE, Same.,135
13268,WILLIE, Are we about through here?,135
13269,KRAMER, I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.,135
13270,JOEY, She had a little change of plans.,135
13271,KRAMER," What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?",135
13272,GIRL, Now we finish it.,135
13273,KRAMER, Aah! Aah! Mama!,135
13274,JERRY,"  Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.",135
13275,JERRY," Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. ",135
13276,JERRY, So... did you stop by the dojo?,135
13277,ELAINE, Yep.,135
13278,JERRY, How's your confidence level?,135
13279,ELAINE, Shot.,135
13280,JERRY, Self-esteem?,135
13281,ELAINE, Gone.,135
13282,JERRY, Doofus?,135
13283,ELAINE,  Yo.,135
13284,JERRY," All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?",135
13285,JERRY, What is that?,135
13286,ELAINE, It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.,135
13287,JERRY," Well, nobody sees the... cover.",135
13288,KRAMER, God!,135
13289,JERRY, What happened to you?,135
13290,KRAMER, Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh.  What is that?,135
13291,JERRY, It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.,135
13292,KRAMER, Oh I see.  Woof!,135
13293,ELAINE,  You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!,135
13294,KRAMER," Well, then I was way off!",135
13295,ELAINE," Well, I'll see ya... ",135
13296,JERRY, Vaya con dios.,135
13297,KRAMER,"  Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?",135
13298,JERRY," No, he's still stuck at the foundation.",135
13299,KRAMER," You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.",135
13300,JERRY, Widower? Wait a second. ,135
13301,WYCK," Okay, let's see. The beachhouse. 48 acres... ooh. Southampton. That should fetch a fair price.",135
13302,GEORGE, Would I have had access to that?,135
13303,WYCK," Of course, it would have been yours.",135
13304,GEORGE, And now?,135
13305,GEORGE,  Not.,135
13306,GEORGE, Hello?,135
13307,JERRY," Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.",135
13308,GEORGE, My story?,135
13309,JERRY," Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof.  When are you getting out of there?",135
13310,GEORGE," Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?",135
13311,WYCK,"  Oh, no, not even close.",135
13312,GEORGE,  I can't go.,135
13313,JERRY," What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!",135
13314,WYCK," Okay, next item. Susan's doll collection. Estimated value",135
13315,GEORGE, You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!,136
13316,WYCK," Well, we think it would be a nice touch for the Foundation literature. Do you have a favorite poet, George?",136
13317,GEORGE," I like, uh...",136
13318,WYCK, Pardon?,136
13319,GEORGE, ,136
13320,WYCK," Well, you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the time of her unfortunate ...accident.",136
13321,JERRY, He cleared his throat?,136
13322,GEORGE, Yes!,136
13323,JERRY, So?,136
13324,GEORGE," He did it right as he said ""her unfortunate accident.""",136
13325,JERRY, Not getting it.,136
13326,GEORGE," Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!",136
13327,JERRY," Oh, help me, Rhonda.",136
13328,GEORGE, What time is it?,136
13329,JERRY , 1,136
13330,GEORGE, Right now?,136
13331,JERRY, I gotta go meet Pam.,136
13332,GEORGE," Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?",136
13333,JERRY, Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.,136
13334,GEORGE, Where's Elaine?,136
13335,JERRY," She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?",136
13336,GEORGE, What's with all these people having babies?,136
13337,JERRY, Perpetuation of the species.,136
13338,GEORGE, Yeah! Right!,136
13339,JERRY," By the way, just for the record -",136
13340,GEORGE," No, I did not! ",136
13341,CAROL," ...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!",136
13342,ELAINE," Well, that's...that's sweet.",136
13343,GAIL, Being a mother has made me feel so beautiful.,136
13344,CAROL," Elaine, you gotta have a baby!",136
13345,ELAINE," Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...",136
13346,LISA, Elaine. Move to Long Island and have a baby already.,136
13347,ELAINE, I really like the city.,136
13348,CAROL, The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?,136
13349,ELAINE," Uh, it was in the Hamptons.",136
13350,CAROL, Oh! I have pictures!,136
13351,ELAINE," No, no, that's okay, it's uh...",136
13352,CAROL , Look at him! Just look at him!,136
13353,JERRY," So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...",136
13354,GEORGE, Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?,136
13355,JERRY," You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?",136
13356,GEORGE, Jerry Lewis?,136
13357,JERRY," I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.",136
13358,GEORGE, That's pretty paranoid.,136
13359,JERRY," Yes, it is.",136
13360,GEORGE, I like it!,136
13361,JERRY, I thought you might.,136
13362,PAM," Oh, hi! I'm Pam. You must be Kramer.  Jerry's told me a lot about you.  Well, I'm supposed to meet Jerry, it's my day off. I work in a bookstore.",136
13363,KRAMER , Books. ,136
13364,PAM," Oh, careful! ",136
13365,JERRY," Hi, sorry I'm late.",136
13366,PAM, That's okay. Kramer let me in.,136
13367,JERRY," You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.",136
13368,PAM, Okay.  It was really nice meeting you.,136
13369,KRAMER," I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.",136
13370,NEWMAN, Go on.,136
13371,KRAMER," Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.",136
13372,NEWMAN," Ah, yes. Forbidden love.",136
13373,KRAMER, She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.,136
13374,NEWMAN," ""Pam."" I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.",136
13375,KRAMER, I can't even speak in front of her. ,136
13376,NEWMAN, Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? ,136
13377,KRAMER, She has delicate beauty.,136
13378,NEWMAN, Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.,136
13379,KRAMER," And yet, he's my friend.",136
13380,NEWMAN," And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.",136
13381,KRAMER," Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.",136
13382,NEWMAN," One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.",136
13383,KRAMER, I thought we were talking about me.,136
13384,NEWMAN," Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.",136
13385,KRAMER, Confront Jerry? I can't.,136
13386,NEWMAN, You must!,136
13387,KRAMER, I won't!,136
13388,NEWMAN, You will!,136
13389,ELAINE ," ""Elaine, ya gotta have a baby."" Ugh.",136
13390,GEORGE, Where are all the poetry magazines?,136
13391,ELAINE, The New Yorker has poetry.,136
13392,GEORGE, Yes. The New Yorker.,136
13393,JERRY, Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?,136
13394,ELAINE," They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.",136
13395,JERRY," C'mon, you want to have a baby.",136
13396,ELAINE, Why? Because I can?,136
13397,JERRY," It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?",136
13398,ELAINE, Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!,136
13399,KEVIN, I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.,136
13400,ELAINE," Oh, I'm sorry.",136
13401,KEVIN," No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.",136
13402,ELAINE," Yeah, like you must procreate.",136
13403,KEVIN," Besides, anyone can do it.",136
13404,ELAINE," Oh, it's been done to death. ",136
13405,GEORGE," I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.",136
13406,WYCK," Are you okay, George?",136
13407,GEORGE," No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad.  Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. ",136
13408,WYCK," ...and the stock options for this year look quite, uh... ",136
13409,GEORGE , Briefcase. ,136
13410,ELAINE," So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?",136
13411,KEVIN, Not at all.,136
13412,ELAINE," 'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian.  You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot.  Right? Am I right?  Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin.  Oh, you got a little, uh...",136
13413,KRAMER ," Oh, I just had two double-fudge sundaes.",136
13414,ELAINE, Oh. Are you alright?,136
13415,KRAMER," Yeah, I'll be okay.",136
13416,ELAINE," You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.",136
13417,KRAMER," Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.",136
13418,ELAINE," Oh, no...that won't last.",136
13419,KRAMER, What do you mean?,136
13420,ELAINE, He's not ga-ga.,136
13421,GEORGE," Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah!  Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.",136
13422,JERRY, How long did you leave it up there?,136
13423,GEORGE, Five minutes. What the hell happened here?,136
13424,JERRY," Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.",136
13425,GEORGE," I have to rewind it first.  Alright, alright.",136
13426,JERRY, Is that it?,136
13427,GEORGE, Stopped dead.,136
13428,JERRY, What do you make of it?,136
13429,GEORGE, I don't know. ,136
13430,KRAMER," Jerry. Uh, can we talk?",136
13431,GEORGE , Kinda busy here.,136
13432,KRAMER, I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.,136
13433,GEORGE, Why can't I stay?,136
13434,KRAMER, Because it doesn't concern you.,136
13435,GEORGE," Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. ",136
13436,JERRY," So, what's on your mind?",136
13437,KRAMER, It's Pam.,136
13438,JERRY, Pam? What about Pam?,136
13439,KRAMER," I love her, Jerry!",136
13440,JERRY, You what?,136
13441,KRAMER, I love her!,136
13442,JERRY, Is that right?,136
13443,KRAMER," Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.",136
13444,JERRY, What does that mean?,136
13445,KRAMER," Oh, and that voice!",136
13446,JERRY, What about her name?,136
13447,KRAMER," Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name.  Pam. Pam. Pam!",136
13448,JERRY, She's got really nice hair.,136
13449,KRAMER," Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.",136
13450,JERRY, You've got really specific tastes.,136
13451,KRAMER," Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.",136
13452,JERRY, She's got nice calves.,136
13453,KRAMER," Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...",136
13454,JERRY," Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.",136
13455,KRAMER," No you can't, Jerry.",136
13456,JERRY, But I might.,136
13457,KRAMER," Oh, no you don't.",136
13458,JERRY, Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?,136
13459,KRAMER, What...?,136
13460,JERRY, I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!,136
13461,KRAMER , Huh?,136
13462,JERRY, Pam!,136
13463,KRAMER, Huh?,136
13464,JERRY, Pam!,136
13465,KRAMER, Huh-yah! ,136
13466,KRAMER, So now he wants her more than ever!,136
13467,NEWMAN, Blast!,136
13468,KRAMER," What am I gonna do, huh?",136
13469,NEWMAN," Don't despair, my friend.  I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.",136
13470,KRAMER," What, again with you?",136
13471,NEWMAN, Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.,136
13472,KRAMER, If only I could say things like that around her.,136
13473,NEWMAN , Yes...,136
13474,ELAINE," Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...",136
13475,GEORGE," Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!",136
13476,ELAINE, ...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.',136
13477,GEORGE," It's baffling, isn't it?",136
13478,ELAINE," Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?",136
13479,GEORGE," They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. ",136
13480,JERRY, That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!,136
13481,ELAINE, Ga-ga? When did that happen?,136
13482,JERRY, Yesterday. Six-ish.,136
13483,ELAINE," Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.",136
13484,JERRY, You just met the guy yesterday.,136
13485,ELAINE," Yeah, but we have a common goal.",136
13486,JERRY," A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?",136
13487,ELAINE , Yeah.,136
13488,GEORGE, And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.,136
13489,ELAINE," Yeah, of course.",136
13490,JERRY," Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.",136
13491,ELAINE," Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.",136
13492,GEORGE," Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, ""Pardon my French.""",136
13493,JERRY, I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.,136
13494,GEORGE, I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.,136
13495,NEWMAN," With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. ",136
13496,PAM," Oh, hi! Kramer.",136
13497,NEWMAN , Hi. How are you?,136
13498,KRAMER, Hi. How are you?,136
13499,PAM, I'm great.,136
13500,NEWMAN, I too am well.,136
13501,KRAMER, I too am well.,136
13502,NEWMAN, Do I smell Pantene?,136
13503,KRAMER, Do I smell?,136
13504,NEWMAN, Pantene!,136
13505,KRAMER," Uh, Pantene.",136
13506,PAM," Oh, my shampoo. Yeah, it is Pantene, I got a free sample in with my junk mail.",136
13507,KRAMER ," Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...",136
13508,NEWMAN , ...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...,136
13509,KRAMER, Newman! ,136
13510,PAM, What?,136
13511,KRAMER," Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.",136
13512,PAM, That's so true.,136
13513,KRAMER, Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...,136
13514,NEWMAN, Shell.,136
13515,KRAMER, ...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.,136
13516,PAM," Kramer, that is so lovely.",136
13517,KRAMER, It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.,136
13518,PAM," Oh, what's his name?",136
13519,KRAMER, Newman. ,136
13520,KEVIN," Elaine, you've changed my life.",136
13521,ELAINE," Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.",136
13522,KEVIN, I got a vasectomy this morning.,136
13523,ELAINE," Although, I have a hunch you mean it.",136
13524,JERRY," I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.",136
13525,PAM," Oh. Well, that's um......nice. ",136
13526,JERRY, Kramer!,136
13527,NEWMAN," Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?",136
13528,JERRY, Pam? What do you care? ,136
13529,NEWMAN," Well, ta-ta! ",136
13530,JERRY, Wait a minute! ,136
13531,JERRY," Alright, Newman! This is it! ",136
13532,NEWMAN ," Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.",136
13533,JERRY, Why not?,136
13534,NEWMAN," Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. ",136
13535,JERRY , C'mon. ,136
13536,JERRY, I can't believe I'm losing Pam!,136
13537,NEWMAN," I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.",136
13538,JERRY, I thought we were talking about me.,136
13539,NEWMAN, Right.,136
13540,JERRY," Anyway, I don't need your help. ",136
13541,NEWMAN," Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane ""observations""?",136
13542,JERRY," Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?",136
13543,NEWMAN," Well, there is a little something you can do for me...",136
13544,JERRY," C'mon, out with it.",136
13545,NEWMAN, It's about...Elaine.,136
13546,JERRY, Elaine? What does she have to -  Oh no...,136
13547,NEWMAN, You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!,136
13548,JERRY ," Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. ",136
13549,KEVIN, I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.,136
13550,ELAINE," I know, I don't want......kids.",136
13551,KEVIN, What was that?,136
13552,ELAINE," Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.",136
13553,KEVIN," This is! Oh boy, I always do this.",136
13554,ELAINE, What?,136
13555,KEVIN," Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.",136
13556,ELAINE, Really?,136
13557,KEVIN," Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.",136
13558,ELAINE," You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...",136
13559,KEVIN, Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!,136
13560,ELAINE, Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.,136
13561,KEVIN, Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.,136
13562,ELAINE, Yeah!,136
13563,KEVIN, Yeah!,136
13564,GEORGE, This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.,136
13565,JERRY, When did you build this thing?,136
13566,GEORGE," Yesterday, took the day off.  Now, from the time I left the room...",136
13567,JERRY ," Wait, that's you?",136
13568,GEORGE, Yeah.,136
13569,JERRY , I really think the M&M should be you.,136
13570,GEORGE ," Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage......was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.",136
13571,JERRY, And?,136
13572,GEORGE, Okay. That's what we know.,136
13573,JERRY, But we already knew that.,136
13574,GEORGE," Well, yeah.",136
13575,JERRY, Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.,136
13576,GEORGE, I don't know if you're ready for it.,136
13577,JERRY, Please.,136
13578,GEORGE," I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -",136
13579,JERRY," Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this.  Yeah?",136
13580,VOICE ON SPEAKER, It's Pam.,136
13581,JERRY," C'mon up.  Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'",136
13582,GEORGE," I'm not through here, Jerry.  I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. ",136
13583,PAM, What was that?,136
13584,JERRY, We were just playin.',136
13585,PAM," Listen, I had a long talk with Kramer today...",136
13586,JERRY, Uh huh...,136
13587,PAM," Well, the thing is, I uh...I think I have a little crush on him. ",136
13588,KRAMER, I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!,136
13589,JERRY , This is the man you have a crush on?,136
13590,PAM," Well, I have feelings for both of you.",136
13591,KRAMER, How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.,136
13592,JERRY, Why can't I be a soul mate?,136
13593,KRAMER," Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?",136
13594,PAM, Children? Who said anything about children? I don't want to have children.,136
13595,GEORGE," There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.",136
13596,WYCK, George...,136
13597,GEORGE," You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard.  That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out...""Dear God!"" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.",136
13598,WYCK," George, Quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase, which, for some reason, contained a running tape recorder?",136
13599,GEORGE," Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.",136
13600,ELAINE, What are you guys doing here?,136
13601,JERRY, We're getting vasectomies.,136
13602,ELAINE, Why?,136
13603,NEWMAN , I'm doing it for you.,136
13604,ELAINE, What?,136
13605,JERRY , What'd you do to your hair?,136
13606,ELAINE, I cut it.,136
13607,JERRY, It's a little short.,136
13608,KEVIN, Y'think?,136
13609,JERRY , What are you doing here?,136
13610,ELAINE, Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.,136
13611,GEORGE, ...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.,136
13612,WYCK, Is that a Keats poem?,136
13613,GEORGE," No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. ",136
13614,WYCK, Does anyone think George might have murdered Susan?,136
13615,MR. CROSS," Oh, yeah. I just assumed he murdered her.",136
13616,MS. BAINES, Of course he killed her.,136
13617,WYCK," So it's not just me, then. Alright! Back to business.",136
13618,JERRY, All right. How 'bout this one,137
13619,GEORGE, Fine.,137
13620,JERRY," They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now",137
13621,GEORGE, I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.,137
13622,JERRY," But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!",137
13623,GEORGE," I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..",137
13624,JERRY,  At least it's show business..,137
13625,GEORGE," But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.",137
13626,JERRY, What if she's got no interest in you?,137
13627,GEORGE, W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.,137
13628,KRAMER," George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?",137
13629,GEORGE," Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!",137
13630,KRAMER,  Wha??,137
13631,JERRY,  He knows.,137
13632,GEORGE,"  on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine!  Ha ha!",137
13633,KRAMER,"  Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.",137
13634,GEORGE, You sure?,137
13635,JERRY,  He knows.,137
13636,GEORGE, Wow. Nice.,137
13637,JERRY, Why don't you try your engagement story?,137
13638,GEORGE,  Won't work.,137
13639,JERRY, Are you sure?,137
13640,GEORGE,  He knows.,137
13641,ELAINE," Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. ",137
13642,KEVIN, Friends?,137
13643,ELAINE," Well. I mean.  Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.",137
13644,KEVIN, Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!,137
13645,MAN,  Damn thing is jammed again..,137
13646,KRAMER," You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. ",137
13647,MAN," Come on, let's go.",137
13648,KRAMER,"  Oh, yeah--yeah.. ",137
13649,ELAINE,"  Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.",137
13650,JERRY,"  I don't know, do you have a--",137
13651,JERRY, Not bad. Wuh--what does she--,137
13652,ELAINE,  I put her stats on the back.,137
13653,JERRY," Pretty impressive--""Serious boyfriend '92 to '95."" Owns her own car.. ""Favorite president",137
13654,GEORGE, Hnn! Let me see that.,137
13655,JERRY,"  So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?",137
13656,ELAINE,  You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.,137
13657,JERRY, Why would anybody want a friend.,137
13658,ELAINE,"  Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.",137
13659,JERRY, I mean all that stuff is so small.. ) stupid..,137
13660,GEORGE,"  You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancée..",137
13661,JERRY, What?,137
13662,GEORGE," Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!",137
13663,ELAINE,"  Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. ",137
13664,GEORGE,  Can I keep this?,137
13665,ELAINE," No, I need it.",137
13666,GEORGE,  Thanks.,137
13667,GEORGE," Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..",137

13682,ELAINE,"   would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?",137
13683,JERRY, Would she have hooks?,137
13684,ELAINE," Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?",137

13725,ELAINE,"  Shouldn't he say ""Bad bye""? Isn't that the, opposite of ""Good bye""?",137
13726,JERRY, No. It's still a goodbye.,137

13801,JERRY,"  like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--",137

13851,LELAND," Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.",137
13852,KRAMER," Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..",137
13853,LELAND," No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!",137
13854,KRAMER," Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..",137
13855,LELAND," Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.",137

13887,KEVIN,"  Fourth row, center.",137
13888,ELAINE, Get out! ,137
13889,GENE,  What is the matter with you?,137
13890,ELAINE," Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?",137
13891,GENE, Haven't you done enough already?,137
13892,ELAINE,  It's locked..,137
13893,JERRY," So this is it, huh?",137
13894,GEORGE," But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..",137
13895,JERRY,  I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?  Let's get out of here George.,137
13896,GENE," At work today, I discovered there's a payphone in the lobby that has free long distance.",137
13897,KEVIN," Oh, so what did you do?",137

13906,KEVIN,  Oh. Me so happy. Me want to cry.,137
13907,KRAMER, I wouldn't walk over there.,138
13908,JERRY, Why not?,138
13909,KRAMER," It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.",138
13910,JERRY, What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.,138
13911,KRAMER, I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.,138
13912,JERRY," No, cab's comin' in right here  Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.",138
13913,KRAMER," Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.",138
13914,JERRY," You were livin' in the village then, right?",138
13915,KRAMER, Don't really remember.													 ,138
13916,ELAINE,  Toxic waste green.,138
13917,JERRY, That is disgusting.,138
13918,ELAINE," You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.",138
13919,JERRY," Well, then you're drivin' me wild.",138
13920,ELAINE, I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.,138
13921,JERRY,"  Oh, why you havin' a party?  ",138
13922,ELAINE," I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.",138
13923,JERRY, Like with dogs.,138
13924,ELAINE, Exactly.,138
13925,GEORGE, Party?,138
13926,ELAINE, Yeah.,138
13927,GEORGE, Food?,138
13928,ELAINE, Uh huh.,138
13929,GEORGE, Bar?,138
13930,ELAINE, Yeah.,138
13931,GEORGE, George?,138
13932,JERRY, He's gonna show up anyway.,138
13933,ELAINE," George, I just don't want you interfering.",138
13934,GEORGE, How could I possibly interfere?,138
13935,JERRY, Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?,138
13936,GEORGE,"  Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic.  You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out?   She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?",138
13937,ANNA, No thanks.,138
13938,GEORGE," Hi ah, My name is George.",138
13939,ANNA, Anna. I don't recall seeing you around the office. Do you work in the mail room?,138
13940,GEORGE," No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.",138
13941,ANNA, Oh. Excuse me. ,138
13942,GEORGE, So...,138
13943,MAN, How 'bout leading us in a toast?,138
13944,ELAINE," Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! ",138
13945,GEORGE, Sweet Fancy Moses!,138
13946,KRAMER, You get the tickets?,138
13947,JERRY, Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.,138
13948,KRAMER, Death Blow,138
13949,JERRY," Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?",138
13950,KRAMER," Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.",138
13951,JERRY, Yeah I guess I do owe you.,138
13952,KRAMER," Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?",138
13953,JERRY," No, I'm okay.",138
13954,KRAMER," There's no problem, really.",138
13955,JERRY, I'm fine.  How was the party?,138
13956,GEORGE, Food was good.,138
13957,JERRY," Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?",138
13958,GEORGE," Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment.  Have you ever seen Elaine dance?",138
13959,JERRY, Elaine danced?,138
13960,GEORGE, It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.,138
13961,JERRY, Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?,138
13962,GEORGE," What, you mean you know about this?",138
13963,JERRY, For some time...  It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.,138
13964,GEORGE," Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.",138
13965,JERRY, And by then you've lost interest.,138
13966,GEORGE," Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.",138
13967,JERRY, What made him get that thing?,138
13968,GEORGE, During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.,138
13969,JERRY, Not a very long trip. ,138
13970,KRAMER, Brody's in.,138
13971,JERRY, I don't even have the extra ticket yet.,138
13972,KRAMER," Well, you better get on the horn.",138
13973,ELAINE," I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. ",138
13974,JERRY, How could that be?,138
13975,ELAINE," Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?",138
13976,JERRY," No, George was there, he said he had a great time.",138
13977,ELAINE," Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.",138
13978,JERRY," Oh, what are you talkin' about?",138
13979,ELAINE," He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.",138
13980,JERRY, Now you're talkin' crazy!,138
13981,ELAINE," All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?",138
13982,JERRY,"  Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.													 ",138
13983,ANNA, You have a minute to approve some copy?,138
13984,ELAINE," Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?",138
13985,ANNA, It was a real... kick.,138
13986,ELAINE," Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?",138
13987,ANNA, As a matter of fact I did.,138
13988,ELAINE," Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.",138
13989,ANNA, Why? He seems harmless.,138
13990,ELAINE, Oh he's not. He's very harmful.,138
13991,ANNA, Really?,138
13992,ELAINE, Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.,138
13993,ANNA, And you two are friends?,138
13994,ELAINE," Yeah, we're good friends.",138
13995,GEORGE, So this Anna called me from out of the blue.,138
13996,JERRY, Really? I thought you were rebuffed.,138
13997,GEORGE, With extreme prejudice.,138
13998,JERRY, Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.,138
13999,GEORGE," No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.",138
14000,JERRY," Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.",138
14001,GEORGE, I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.,138
14002,JERRY," You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...",138
14003,GEORGE," Yes ... yes, yes",138
14004,JERRY," The bad fiancé&Mac226, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...",138
14005,GEORGE," Okay, the point is made.",138
14006,JERRY," The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen...  The bad tipper!",138
14007,JERRY, Half of show business is here.,138
14008,KRAMER, There's Brody. Brody! Over here.,138
14009,BRODY, Hey Kramer. And you must be Jerry. Thanks for the ticket.,138
14010,JERRY, That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.,138
14011,BRODY, It's for all of us. Is there a problem?,138
14012,KRAMER," Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.",138
14013,JERRY, I'm a joke maker.,138
14014,KRAMER," All right, here we go, Death Blow. ",138
14015,JERRY,"  Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?",138
14016,KRAMER," Relax, he does that all the time.													 													JERRY",138
14017,KRAMER," He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?",138
14018,JERRY, May I see you outside for a moment please?,138
14019,KRAMER, But I want to--,138
14020,JERRY, Outside!,138
14021,ELAINE," Hey, have you seen Anna?",138
14022,WORKER," Uh, she just went to meet your friend George.",138
14023,ELAINE, To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?,138
14024,WORKER," The park, why?",138
14025,ELAINE," Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!",138
14026,JERRY, What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?,138
14027,KRAMER," Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.",138
14028,JERRY, It's not legitimate.,138
14029,KRAMER, It's a business.,138
14030,JERRY, Where did you meet this guy?,138
14031,KRAMER, He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--,138
14032,JERRY, Kramer. ,138
14033,KRAMER," Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!",138
14034,JERRY, I don't believe this. ,138
14035,ANNA, You know I'm not supposed to be talking to you.,138
14036,GEORGE," No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?",138
14037,ANNA, No... a little. Nice car.,138
14038,GEORGE," Yeah, she's a sweet ride.",138
14039,ANNA, Is that your orthopedic back pillow?,138
14040,GEORGE, Maybe.,138
14041,ANNA, Well is it or isn't it?,138
14042,GEORGE, Guess not.,138
14043,ELAINE,  Stay away from her.,138
14044,GEORGE, I didn't do nothin'.,138
14045,ELAINE,  Get in the car.,138
14046,ANNA, But...,138
14047,ELAINE," You heard me young lady, get in the car.  And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.",138
14048,GEORGE, Lighten up.,138
14049,KRAMER," Go get 'em, Death Blow!  You okay?",138
14050,BRODY," Uh, I got a cramp.",138
14051,KRAMER," Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.",138
14052,BRODY," Uh, there it goes again. Kramer, you gotta drive me home.",138
14053,JERRY," Hey, what is going on over there?",138
14054,BRODY," Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me.",138
14055,JERRY, Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.,138
14056,KRAMER," Jerry, if the man is in pain...",138
14057,JERRY," Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.",138
14058,BRODY,  What are you some kind of tough guy?,138
14059,KRAMER," Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.",138
14060,JERRY," All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera.",138
14061,KRAMER,"  C'mon, let's go.",138
14062,JERRY, Oh man...,138
14063,KRAMER," Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?",138
14064,JERRY, How was the rest of Death Blow?,138
14065,KRAMER," Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!",138
14066,JERRY," Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!",138
14067,KRAMER," He's quite a character, isn't he?",138
14068,JERRY," You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!",138
14069,KRAMER, I got it. Yep.,138
14070,BRODY, Brody.,138
14071,KRAMER, Come on up. It's Brody.,138
14072,JERRY," What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.",138
14073,KRAMER," Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.",138
14074,JERRY, What if I didn't do it right?,138
14075,KRAMER, It's your first time. He'll understand.,138
14076,JERRY, People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.,138
14077,KRAMER," Hey, Brody!",138
14078,JERRY, Hi.,138
14079,BRODY," Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape.",138
14080,JERRY, Yeah.,138
14081,BRODY, I've never seen such beautiful work.,138
14082,JERRY, What?,138
14083,BRODY,"  You're a genius. The zoom-ins, the framing. I was enchanted.",138
14084,JERRY," Well, I did the best I could.",138
14085,BRODY," I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility.													 													",138
14086,BRODY, May I use your phone?,138
14087,KRAMER, Uh yeah. It's under the couch.,138
14088,KRAMER, Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.,138
14089,JERRY, I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.,138
14090,KRAMER," But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.",138
14091,JERRY, We're talkin' federal crime here.,138
14092,BRODY,  I'll expect that tape by three o'clock tomorrow.  May I borrow this? ,138
14093,KRAMER," Sure, do you need a glove?",138
14094,BRODY, Nah.,138
14095,WORKER," I pressed through the rushes and there, the native dancers whirled before me",138
14096,ELAINE, What? What is so funny?,138
14097,ANNA," Sorry, I got hung up.",138
14098,ELAINE, At Yankee Stadium?,138
14099,ANNA, This? It's mine.,138
14100,ELAINE," Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.",138
14101,ANNA, He's not stocky.,138
14102,ELAINE, Who did that? Who did that?!?,138
14103,KRAMER,"  The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. ",138
14104,JERRY," No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?",138
14105,KRAMER, That's fine.,138
14106,JERRY, Do you even know what this scene is about?,138
14107,KRAMER, It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.,138
14108,JERRY," No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.",138
14109,KRAMER, Wha? Where?,138
14110,JERRY, Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.,138
14111,KRAMER," Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.",138
14112,JERRY," I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.",138
14113,KRAMER, So you'll do the movie? ,138
14114,JERRY, I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?,138
14115,KRAMER, Right here. ,138
14116,ELAINE," Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing.  What?",138
14117,KRAMER,  This umpf thing.,138
14118,ELAINE, It's dancing.,138
14119,KRAMER," No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally.",138
14120,ELAINE, I dance fine.													 													KRAMER,138
14121,ELAINE," He doesn't know what he's talkin' about.  Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?",138
14122,JERRY, I forgot to make my bed. ,138
14123,ELAINE," Jerry, do I stink?",138
14124,JERRY," All right, you're beyond stink.",138
14125,ELAINE, But I really enjoy dancing.,138
14126,JERRY," And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.",138
14127,ELAINE, It's that bad?,138
14128,JERRY," Have you ever seen yourself?  Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.",138
14129,VOICE, I have George Costanza still holding.,138
14130,ELAINE," George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.",138
14131,GEORGE," Yo, Anna.",138
14132,ANNA," Hi, George. What're you up to?",138
14133,GEORGE,  You don't wanna know.,138
14134,ELAINE," Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.",138
14135,GEORGE," What, wha, what're you talkin' about?",138
14136,ELAINE," Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.",138
14137,GEORGE," Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!",138
14138,ELAINE, I never should have given Anna the impression--,138
14139,GEORGE," Pick it up, pick it up!",138
14140,ELAINE," --that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.",138
14141,GEORGE," Elaine, get off the speaker! ",138
14142,ELAINE, What?,138
14143,GEORGE, You are ruinin' everything.,138
14144,ELAINE, I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?,138
14145,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.",138
14146,ELAINE," George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?",138
14147,ANNA," Um, no, I don't think so.",138
14148,ELAINE," No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.",138
14149,GEORGE, I'm a bad man!,138
14150,BRODY, So where's the tape?,138
14151,JERRY," No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.",138
14152,BRODY, I need the tape.,138
14153,JERRY," You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.",138
14154,BRODY, Are you out of your mind?,138
14155,JERRY, Kramer...,138
14156,KRAMER," I know, Jerry. It's okay.  Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.",138
14157,BRODY, Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street!,138
14158,JERRY," All right. That's it, I can't work like this.",138
14159,KRAMER, Jerry...,138
14160,JERRY, I'm off the project. ,138
14161,KRAMER, Jerry!,138
14162,BRODY, I want the tape.,138
14163,KRAMER, Yeah.,138
14164,GEORGE," Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?",138
14165,JERRY, They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.,138
14166,GEORGE, Anna actually has respect for me now.  It's all over.,138
14167,JERRY," Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. ",138
14168,KRAMER," Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!",138
14169,JERRY," Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...",138
14170,GEORGE, Did you say dangerous?,138
14171,GEORGE, I'm a bootlegger.,138
14172,ANNA, You're a what?,138
14173,GEORGE," I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!",138
14174,ANNA, Isn't that illegal?,138
14175,GEORGE, I can do hard time for this one. And community service!,138
14176,ANNA, Is this your FiberCon?,138
14177,GEORGE,  Get outta my way!,138
14178,KRAMER," Jerry, George got arrested.",138
14179,JERRY, What?,138
14180,KRAMER," Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him.",138
14181,JERRY, Oh now I see.  Yeah.,138
14182,BRODY," Brody, I'm comin' up.",138
14183,JERRY, What're we gonna do?,138
14184,KRAMER," Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?",138
14185,JERRY, I think that's it.  Sweet fancy Moses!													 													KRAMER,138
14186,BRODY, Where's the tape?,138
14187,JERRY," Uh, well. It, uh...",138
14188,BRODY, Is that it?,138
14189,KRAMER," Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.",138
14190,BRODY, How'd it turn out?,138
14191,KRAMER, Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.													 													JERRY,138
14192,KRAMER," Yeah, it's a disturbing image.",138
14193,JERRY," Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.",138
14194,ANNA,"  It's all right, George. You'll just pay a fine and that'll be it.",138
14195,GEORGE, Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? ,138
14196,ELAINE, Anna...,138
14197,ANNA," Oh, Elaine, thanks for picking me up. I can explain everything.",138
14198,ELAINE," All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. ",138
14199,FRANK," Okay, where's my boy?",138
14200,GEORGE, Oh my God.,138
14201,FRANK," I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger? ",138
14202,GEORGE, Ow! Dad...,138
14203,FRANK," Who put you up to this, was it her?",138
14204,ELAINE, All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.,138
14205,FRANK, My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.,138
14206,ELAINE, You got that right.,138
14207,FRANK, What the hell does that mean?,138
14208,ELAINE, That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.,138
14209,FRANK, You sayin' you want a piece of me?,138
14210,ELAINE, I could drop you like a bag of dirt.,138
14211,FRANK, You wanna piece of me? You got it! ,138
14212,JERRY," But he's an old man, Elaine.",138
14213,ELAINE," Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.",138
14214,JERRY,"  Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.",138
14215,ELAINE," Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.",138
14216,JERRY, No you don't.,138
14217,MAN, You shot Death Blow?,138
14218,JERRY, Yeah.,138
14219,MAN, That was brilliant.,138
14220,JERRY, Thank you. ,138
14221,ELAINE, You were big.,138
14222,JERRY, I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?,138
14223,ELAINE," Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.",138
14224,JERRY, I wouldn't worry about it. ,138
14225,ATTENDANT, The doctor will be with you in a moment. ,139
14226,ELAINE, Difficult? ,139
14227,DOCTOR, Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours. ,139
14228,ELAINE," Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper. ",139
14229,DOCTOR, Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash...... ,139
14230,ELAINE, But it was in pen. You fake erase. ,139
14231,DOCTOR, All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.,139
14232,ELAINE, What are you writing? Doctor. ,139
14233,SHEILA, Here you go. ,139
14234,GEORGE, Thanks. ,139
14235,SHEILA, I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt. ,139
14236,GEORGE, Ohhhhhh ,139
14237,JERRY, No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver. ,139
14238,GEORGE, Smile ,139
14239,JERRY, What are you doing? ,139
14240,GEORGE," I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something ",139
14241,JERRY, Extra teeth. I love that look. ,139
14242,GEORGE," Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says "" I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."" ",139
14243,JERRY, What mustard stain? ,139
14244,GEORGE, Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures. ,139
14245,JERRY, Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain? ,139
14246,GEORGE, That's got nothing to do with it. ,139
14247,JERRY, I see. She's looking. ,139
14248,GEORGE, Yesssss. ,139
14249,KRAMER," Hey, you got to get this thing fixed. ",139
14250,JERRY, They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same. ,139
14251,KRAMER, Would you like a refund? ,139
14252,JERRY, Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago. ,139
14253,KRAMER, Would you be interested? ,139
14254,JERRY, Well how are you going..... ,139
14255,KRAMER, Would you? ,139
14256,JERRY, I guess I would. ,139
14257,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. ",139
14258,ELAINE, You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today. ,139
14259,JERRY, Not the gown again. ,139
14260,ELAINE," No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that? ",139
14261,JERRY, They have gotten to know you. ,139
14262,ELAINE, Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash. ,139
14263,GEORGE, Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult. ,139
14264,ELAINE, Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy. ,139
14265,JERRY, Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys. ,139
14266,ELAINE, Listen to me you little shi........ ,139
14267,GEORGE, Smile. ,139
14268,DOCTOR, Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown. ,139
14269,ELAINE, Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on. ,139
14270,DOCTOR, All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin. ,139
14271,ELAINE, Where did you get my chart? ,139
14272,DOCTOR, From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure. ,139
14273,ELAINE, You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just....... ,139
14274,DOCTOR, Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine. ,139
14275,ELAINE," Please, please. It's really, really itchy. ",139
14276,POSTAL WORKER DANNY, Seinfeld? ,139
14277,JERRY, Yeah. ,139
14278,POSTAL WORKER DANNY, I got a package for you. Sign here. ,139
14279,JERRY, Who's it from? ,139
14280,POSTAL WORKER DANNY, No return address. ,139
14281,JERRY, What if I don't want it? ,139
14282,POSTAL WORKER, Are you refusing delivery? ,139
14283,JERRY, Maybe I am. ,139
14284,POSTAL WORKER DANNY, Why would you do that? ,139
14285,JERRY, I've never done it before. ,139
14286,POSTAL WORKER DANNY, Why start now? ,139
14287,JERRY, Why not? ,139
14288,POSTAL WORKER DANNY, All right. ,139
14289,GEORGE, Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package. ,139
14290,JERRY, I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from. ,139
14291,GEORGE, What do you think it's a bomb? ,139
14292,JERRY, It's not totally impossible. ,139
14293,GEORGE, Oh the ego on you. ,139
14294,JERRY, Why can't I be bombable? ,139
14295,GEORGE, Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes. ,139
14296,JERRY, I suppose you think your bombable. ,139
14297,GEORGE, Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way. ,139
14298,JERRY, There's more than a couple. ,139

14300,JERRY, You don't have a Mercedes. ,139
14301,GEORGE, I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine. ,139
14302,JERRY, The driver seems a little put out. ,139
14303,GEORGE, No. He was fine with it. Check that out. ,139
14304,JERRY, Is that Burt Reynolds? ,139
14305,GEORGE, Wax Museum. ,139

14307,GEORGE, Oh. What is this? ,139
14308,JERRY, That's a lot of skin. ,139
14309,GEORGE, This must be Sheila from the photo place. ,139
14310,JERRY, You can barely see her face. ,139

14318,KRAMER," No, no. Your not playing the game. ",139
14319,GEORGE, What game? ,139
14320,KRAMER," She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is "" Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. "" ",139
14321,GEORGE, No good? ,139
14322,KRAMER," George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back. ",139
14323,GEORGE," Oh, I don't know. ",139
14324,KRAMER, Well as you know I've always been something of a photog. ,139

14366,JERRY," No, No bomb. ",139
14367,ELAINE, Well then what? ,139
14368,JERRY, Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up. ,139
14369,ELAINE, But he's okay? ,139
14370,JERRY," Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal. ",139
14371,ELAINE, Yeah I am still holding. ,139
14372,JERRY, Is this my stereo? ,139
14373,KRAMER, Hey you got it. ,139
14374,JERRY, What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up. ,139
14375,KRAMER, That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400. ,139
14376,JERRY, But you were supposed to get me a refund. ,139
14377,KRAMER, You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago. ,139
14378,JERRY, So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo? ,139
14379,KRAMER, It's just a write off for them. ,139
14380,JERRY, How is it a write off? ,139
14381,KRAMER, They just write it off. ,139
14382,JERRY, Write it off what? ,139
14383,KRAMER, Jerry all these big companies they write off everything ,139
14384,JERRY, You don't even know what a write off is. ,139
14385,KRAMER, Do you? ,139
14386,JERRY, No. I don't. ,139
14387,KRAMER, But they do and they are the ones writing it off. ,139

14389,ELAINE," What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello. ",139

14404,KRAMER, I don't know it's up to you. ,139
14405,GEORGE, Do you think it would be better if I did? ,139
14406,KRAMER, It might be. I mean whatever you want. ,139

14425,DR. RESNICK, Leo. I heard you had a little mishap. ,139

14500,KRAMER, I don't know. But now they got a chart on me. ,139
14501,SHEILA, I don't know where they could be. ,139
14502,GEORGE, Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues. ,139
14503,SHEILA, Well if I find them I'll call you. ,139

14512,SHEILA, Newman? ,139
14513,GEORGE, I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for. ,139
14514,NEWMAN," Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out. ",139
14515,JERRY, I'm clean and you know it. ,139
14516,NEWMAN, Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance. ,139
14517,JERRY, Where did you get that? ,139
14518,GEORGE, I think that's one of mine. ,139
14519,NEWMAN, It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad. ,139
14520,JERRY, I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation. ,139
14521,NEWMAN, Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile..... ,139
14522,GUY, NEWMAN!! ,139
14523,NEWMAN, There will be a small fine. ,139

14529,GEORGE, OH MY GOD!!! ,139
14530,NEWMAN, We have some questions we'd like you to answer. ,139
14531,JERRY, I have some questions of my own. ,139
14532,SHEILA," Hi. One of your mailmen....... Oh my god, George!?! ",139
14533,GEORGE, Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful. ,139
14534,JERRY, The timeless art of seduction. ,139
14535,GEORGE, SHEILA!!! ,139
14536,JERRY,"I've been watching women in the department stores. They're trying on clothes, and I've noticed that they do it differently from men. Women don't try on the clothes, they get behind the clothes, you see? They take a dress off the rack, and they hold it up against themself. They can tell something from this. They stick one leg way out 'cause they nedd to know, if some day I'm one-legged, and at a fourty-five degree angle, what am I gonna wear? You never see a man do that. You never see a guy take a suit off the rack, put his head in the neck, and go, ""What do you think about this suit? I think I'll get it. Yeah, it looks fine. Put some shoes by the bottom of the pants, I wanna make sure. Yeah, perfect. And what if I'm walking? Move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes.",14
14537,JERRY," What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?",14
14538,ELAINE," Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?",14
14539,JERRY, He was good in Man From Uncle.,14
14540,ELAINE, Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?,14
14541,JERRY," I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.",14
14542,ELAINE," Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious.  Hey, look at naked people.",14
14543,JERRY," No, I don't wanna see the naked people.",14
14544,ELAINE, Been a while?,14
14545,JERRY," I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.",14
14546,ELAINE, I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.,14
14547,JERRY," I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. ",14
14548,ELAINE, What?,14
14549,JERRY, What?,14
14550,ELAINE, What was that look?,14
14551,JERRY, What look?,14
14552,ELAINE, The look you just gave me.,14
14553,JERRY, I gave a look?,14
14554,ELAINE, Yes.,14
14555,JERRY, What kind of look?,14
14556,ELAINE, I know that look.,14
14557,JERRY, Then what was it?,14
14558,ELAINE, Why should I tell you?,14
14559,JERRY," Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.",14
14560,ELAINE, Trust me. I know the look.  So...,14
14561,JERRY, What?,14
14562,ELAINE, What about the look?,14
14563,JERRY, I don't know.,14
14564,ELAINE, You got something on your mind?,14
14565,JERRY, No. Things pop into your head. You?,14
14566,ELAINE, Things occur to me from time to time.,14
14567,JERRY," Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.",14
14568,ELAINE," No, of course not.",14
14569,JERRY," I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?",14
14570,ELAINE, Thirty-seven.,14
14571,JERRY," Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. ",14
14572,ELAINE, We know the terrain.,14
14573,JERRY, No big surprises.,14
14574,ELAINE, Nope.,14
14575,JERRY, What do you think?,14
14576,ELAINE, I don't know. What do you think?,14
14577,JERRY," Well, it's something to consider.",14
14578,ELAINE, Yeah.,14
14579,JERRY," I mean, let's say we did.",14
14580,ELAINE, What if.,14
14581,JERRY, Is that like the end of the world or something?,14
14582,ELAINE, Certainly not.,14
14583,JERRY, Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?,14
14584,ELAINE, I know.,14
14585,JERRY," I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there.  We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.",14
14586,ELAINE, It's almost stupid if we didn't.,14
14587,JERRY, It's moronic.,14
14588,ELAINE, Absurd!,14
14589,JERRY," Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.",14
14590,ELAINE," We, there are always a few.",14
14591,JERRY," I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.",14
14592,ELAINE, Devastating.,14
14593,JERRY, Because this is very good. ,14
14594,ELAINE, And that would be good. ,14
14595,JERRY, That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.,14
14596,ELAINE," Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.",14
14597,JERRY," But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.",14
14598,ELAINE, Huh.,14
14599,JERRY," For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.",14
14600,ELAINE, Right.,14
14601,JERRY," But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.",14
14602,ELAINE," Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.",14
14603,JERRY, Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.,14
14604,ELAINE," All right, sir.",14
14605,JERRY, Now here's another little rule.,14
14606,ELAINE, Yeah.,14
14607,JERRY," When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.",14
14608,ELAINE," Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!",14
14609,JERRY, Well now we're gettin' somewhere.,14
14610,ELAINE, What about the kiss goodnight?,14
14611,JERRY, Tough one. You're call.,14
14612,ELAINE, It's brug-wa .,14
14613,JERRY, Fine. Well.,14
14614,ELAINE, Well.,14
14615,JERRY, You ready?,14
14616,ELAINE, Ready.,14
14617,JERRY, So think you can handle this?,14
14618,ELAINE, Definitely. ,14
14619,KRAMER, Hey.,14
14620,JERRY, Hey.,14
14621,KRAMER, Got the paper?,14
14622,JERRY, Not yet.,14
14623,KRAMER, No paper?,14
14624,JERRY, I haven't been out yet.,14
14625,KRAMER," Well, what's taking you so long?  Uh? Oh, well, yeah... ",14
14626,GEORGE," What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?",14
14627,JERRY," No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?",14
14628,GEORGE, Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?,14
14629,JERRY, Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.,14
14630,GEORGE, Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.,14
14631,JERRY, I thought you'd like that.,14
14632,GEORGE," Oh, this is huge!",14
14633,JERRY, I know.,14
14634,GEORGE," All right, okay. Let's go, details.",14
14635,JERRY," No, I can't do details.",14
14636,GEORGE, You wha?,14
14637,JERRY, I can't give details.,14
14638,GEORGE, No details?,14
14639,JERRY, I'm not in the mood.,14
14640,GEORGE," You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!",14
14641,JERRY," All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.",14
14642,GEORGE, Where are you sitting?,14
14643,JERRY, On the couch.,14
14644,GEORGE, Next to each other?,14
14645,JERRY," No, separated.",14
14646,GEORGE, Time?,14
14647,JERRY, Around eleven.,14
14648,GEORGE," Okay, go ahead.",14
14649,JERRY," So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.",14
14650,GEORGE," Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.",14
14651,JERRY," And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.",14
14652,GEORGE," Boy, these are really bad details.",14
14653,JERRY," It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.",14
14654,GEORGE, Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.,14
14655,JERRY, Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.,14
14656,GEORGE, Better than before?,14
14657,JERRY, She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.,14
14658,GEORGE, This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?,14
14659,JERRY, Not exactly.,14
14660,GEORGE, Not exactly. What does that mean?,14
14661,JERRY," Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. ",14
14662,GEORGE, Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.													 Thousands of years people have been trying to have their cake and eat it too. So all of a sudden the two of you are going to come along and do it. Where do you get the ego? No one can do it. It can't be done.,14
14663,JERRY, I think we've worked out a system.,14
14664,GEORGE," Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.",14
14665,JERRY," No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.",14
14666,GEORGE," Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.",14
14667,JERRY, Okay. No calls the next day.,14
14668,GEORGE,"  So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good.  Go ahead.",14
14669,JERRY, You ready for the second one?,14
14670,GEORGE," I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.",14
14671,JERRY, Spending the night. Optional.,14
14672,GEORGE," No, you see? You got greedy.",14
14673,JERRY," No, that's the rule. It's optional.",14
14674,GEORGE," I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide  You're not going anywhere.",14
14675,JERRY, I think you're wrong.,14
14676,GEORGE, I hope I am.,14
14677,JERRY, Is this yours or the roommate's?,14
14678,ELAINE, The roommate's.,14
14679,JERRY, Would she mind?,14
14680,ELAINE, She keeps track of everything.,14
14681,JERRY," Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.",14
14682,ELAINE, Thanks.,14
14683,JERRY," Well, guess I'll get going.",14
14684,ELAINE, Oh.,14
14685,JERRY," Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.",14
14686,ELAINE," Fine, go away.",14
14687,JERRY, I don't understand. Is there a problem?  I'm getting the impression there's a problem.,14
14688,ELAINE, Just go.,14
14689,JERRY, I'm having surgery tomorrow.,14
14690,ELAINE," Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.",14
14691,JERRY," But you said, it can be very serious.",14
14692,ELAINE," Okay, so fine. Go.",14
14693,JERRY, What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.,14
14694,ELAINE," Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.",14
14695,JERRY, It has nothing to do with whose house it is.,14
14696,ELAINE," Oh, of course it does. ",14
14697,JERRY, Hi.,14
14698,ELAINE, Oh really?,14
14699,ELAINE," Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?",14
14700,ELAINE, What are you doing?,14
14701,JERRY, I can't go if you're mad.,14
14702,ELAINE, I'm not mad.,14
14703,JERRY, You seemed a little mad.,14
14704,ELAINE," No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.",14
14705,JERRY, So you're okay with everything?,14
14706,ELAINE, Definitely. Are you?,14
14707,JERRY," Definitely. Well, goodnight.",14
14708,ELAINE, Goodn--  What're you doing?,14
14709,JERRY, What?,14
14710,ELAINE, Rules.,14
14711,GEORGE, What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.,14
14712,JERRY," No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.",14
14713,GEORGE, Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.,14
14714,JERRY," No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.",14
14715,GEORGE," What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?",14
14716,JERRY," You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.",14
14717,GEORGE, What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.,14
14718,JERRY, I think I heard her say something about a bench.,14
14719,GEORGE, A bench? What kind of a bench?,14
14720,JERRY," I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.",14
14721,GEORGE," What, like at a bus stop?",14
14722,JERRY, I don't know.,14
14723,GEORGE, Like a park bench?,14
14724,JERRY, I have no idea.,14
14725,GEORGE, Who puts a bench in their house?,14
14726,JERRY, Forget the bench.,14
14727,GEORGE, I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?,14
14728,JERRY," No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.",14
14729,GEORGE," Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.",14
14730,JERRY, Nice looking fellow.,14
14731,GEORGE, What about candle holders?,14
14732,JERRY, Too romantic.,14
14733,GEORGE, Lingerie?,14
14734,JERRY, Too sexual.,14
14735,GEORGE, Waffle maker.,14
14736,JERRY, Too domestic.,14
14737,GEORGE, Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.,14
14738,JERRY, Too Gubernatorial. ,14
14739,GEORGE, Let's work on the card.,14
14740,JERRY, Maybe you won't like it.,14
14741,ELAINE," Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.",14
14742,JERRY, You could not like it.,14
14743,ELAINE, Just the fact that you remembered means everything.,14
14744,JERRY," Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. ",14
14745,ELAINE, Cash?,14
14746,JERRY, Would do you think?,14
14747,ELAINE, You got me cash?,14
14748,JERRY, Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?,14
14749,ELAINE," Who are you, my uncle?",14
14750,JERRY, Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.,14
14751,ELAINE," Let me see the card.  To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? ",14
14752,KRAMER," Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. ",14
14753,ELAINE, Pal? You think I'm your pal?,14
14754,JERRY," I said, ""and more.""",14
14755,ELAINE, I am not your pal.,14
14756,JERRY, What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? ,14
14757,ELAINE," Oh, what is this? You got me something?",14
14758,KRAMER, Yeah. Open it.,14
14759,ELAINE, Oh Kramer...  The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! ,14
14760,KRAMER," That's pretty good, huh?",14
14761,JERRY, Great.,14
14762,KRAMER, Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.,14
14763,JERRY, Well goody for you.,14
14764,KRAMER," Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?",14
14765,JERRY, 182 bucks.,14
14766,KRAMER, Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.,14
14767,ELAINE,  Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.,14
14768,KRAMER,  Yates.,14
14769,ELAINE, Oh Kramer. ,14
14770,JERRY, Could you excuse us please?,14
14771,KRAMER, What?,14
14772,JERRY, We're talking.,14
14773,KRAMER," Oh, the relationship. ",14
14774,JERRY," You know, we never had one fight before this deal.",14
14775,ELAINE, I know.,14
14776,JERRY, Never.,14
14777,ELAINE, Ever.,14
14778,JERRY, We got along beautifully.,14
14779,ELAINE, Like clams.,14
14780,JERRY, It was wonderful.,14
14781,ELAINE, A pleasure.,14
14782,JERRY," So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.",14
14783,ELAINE, I can't do it.,14
14784,JERRY, You what?,14
14785,ELAINE, I can't do that.,14
14786,JERRY," You mean it's...  No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?",14
14787,ELAINE," This, that, and the other.",14
14788,JERRY," Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?",14
14789,ELAINE, You.,14
14790,JERRY,  Well...,14
14791,GEORGE," Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.",14
14792,JERRY, I never should have made up those rules.,14
14793,GEORGE, What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?,14
14794,JERRY, It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.,14
14795,GEORGE, You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.,14
14796,JERRY, Why?,14
14797,GEORGE," It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.",14
14798,JERRY, What did you end up giving her?,14
14799,GEORGE, 91 dollars.,14
14800,JERRY, Sorry about that.,14
14801,GEORGE, So what're you gonna do?,14
14802,JERRY," Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.",14
14803,GEORGE," So, maybe this should be it.",14
14804,JERRY, Could be it.,14
14805,GEORGE, She seems like an it.,14
14806,JERRY," She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...",14
14807,GEORGE, We'd have to kill him.,14
14808,JERRY," We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.",14
14809,GEORGE, I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.,14
14810,JERRY," Plus, you know what else.",14
14811,GEORGE, You better call her.,14
14812,KRAMER, Hey.,14
14813,JERRY, Hey.,14
14814,KRAMER, You got the paper yet?,14
14815,JERRY, Yeah.,14
14816,KRAMER," Well where is it?  Hey, you done with that?",14
14817,ELAINE, No.,14
14818,KRAMER," Well, you're not reading it now.",14
14819,ELAINE," All right, you can take it. But I want it back.",14
14820,KRAMER," Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?",14
14821,ELAINE," Ah, this. And that.",14
14822,JERRY, And the other.,14
14823,KRAMER," Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. ",14
14824,WOMAN," Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so limiting.",140
14825,JERRY, My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.,140
14826,WOMAN," Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move I ever made.",140
14827,JERRY, Mentor? You mean your boss.,140
14828,WOMAN," Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing.",140
14829,JERRY, Hmm. So Cynthia's your mentor.,140
14830,WOMAN," And I'm her protégé. You must have someone like that. You know, who guides you in your career path.",140
14831,JERRY," Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.",140
14832,GEORGE, I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?,140
14833,JERRY, Yes. And the mentor advises the protégé.,140
14834,GEORGE, Is there any money involved?,140
14835,JERRY, No.,140
14836,GEORGE, So what's in it for the mentor?,140
14837,JERRY," Respect, admiration, prestige.",140
14838,GEORGE, Pssh. Would the protégé pick up stuff for the mentor?,140
14839,JERRY," I suppose if it was on the protégé's way to the mentor, they might.",140
14840,GEORGE, Laundry? Dry cleaning?,140
14841,JERRY," It's not a valet, it's a protégé.",140
14842,GEORGE," Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.",140
14843,JERRY,  Risk management?,140
14844,GEORGE, Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.,140
14845,JERRY, Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?,140
14846,GEORGE, I guess it's on my resume.,140
14847,JERRY, Hello?,140
14848,VOICE, Please hold for Elaine Benes.,140
14849,GEORGE," You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice.",140
14850,JERRY, So get this book on tape.,140
14851,GEORGE," You can't, it's a textbook.",140
14852,ELAINE," Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?",140
14853,JERRY, Am I going? It was three nights ago.,140
14854,ELAINE," What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.",140
14855,JERRY," Oh, it was a lovely affair.",140
14856,ELAINE," Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time.  Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?",140
14857,JEANINE, Eddie Sherman.,140
14858,ELAINE," Alright, send him up here.",140
14859,JERRY, You gonna do a little yelling?,140
14860,ELAINE, I'm gonna do a little firing.,140
14861,JERRY," That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?",140
14862,ELAINE," Oh yeah, sure.  Gimme a break.",140
14863,JERRY," Hey, Copernicus?",140
14864,JEANINE, Eddie Sherman is here.,140
14865,ELAINE," Oh, great. Send him in.",140
14866,EDDIE, You wanted to see me?,140
14867,ELAINE," Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you.",140
14868,JERRY," So, what did you say?",140
14869,ELAINE," Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.",140
14870,JERRY, What? What did you--,140
14871,ELAINE, Copywriter.,140
14872,JERRY, He's writing copy?,140
14873,ELAINE, Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.,140
14874,KRAMER, Yowza yowza. Check it out.,140
14875,JERRY,  Jewish singles night?,140
14876,KRAMER, I expect you both to be there.,140
14877,ELAINE, I'm not Jewish.,140
14878,KRAMER, Well neither am I.,140
14879,JERRY, Well why are you going?,140
14880,KRAMER," I'm not, I'm running it.",140
14881,JERRY, What are you talking about?,140
14882,KRAMER," Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.",140
14883,JERRY, Lomez is Jewish?,140
14884,KRAMER," Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.",140
14885,ELAINE,  At the Knights of Columbus?,140
14886,KRAMER," Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.",140
14887,JERRY," Kramer, you know, I--",140
14888,KRAMER," No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.",140
14889,ELAINE,  A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.,140
14890,KRAMER, Do you like tsimmis?,140
14891,ABBY, My mentor says the duck is outstanding here.,140
14892,JERRY," I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.",140
14893,ABBY," Oh! Look who's here, Cynthia!",140
14894,CYNTHIA," Hello, Abby.",140
14895,ABBY," Hello. Jerry, this is Cynthia Pearlman, my mentor.",140
14896,JERRY, Hello.,140
14897,CYNTHIA," Hi Jerry, nice to finally meet you.",140
14898,ABBY," Well come join us, we could pull up a chair.",140
14899,CYNTHIA," Great, my boyfriend's just parking the car. Actually, Jerry, you													night know him, he's a comic too.",140
14900,JERRY, No kidding?,140
14901,CYNTHIA, Kenny Bania.,140
14902,JERRY, Bania?,140
14903,BANIA," Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck here's the best. The best, Jerry.",140
14904,GEORGE," Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?",140
14905,MAN, Reading for the Blind. They can get any book on tape.,140
14906,GEORGE," I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.",140
14907,MAN," Oh, tell me about it. These things have ruined me for Braille.",140
14908,JERRY, Reading for the Blind?,140
14909,GEORGE," I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.",140
14910,JERRY," So, I finally met the mentor.",140
14911,GEORGE, What's she like? Impressive?,140
14912,JERRY," Oh yeah, she's dating Bania.",140
14913,GEORGE, Bania?,140
14914,JERRY, Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.,140
14915,GEORGE, What did you have?,140
14916,JERRY," Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?",140
14917,GEORGE, Marsala?,140
14918,JERRY," Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.",140
14919,JERRY," Hey, good luck with that.",140
14920,GEORGE, Thank you.,140
14921,GEORGE, Dad.,140
14922,FRANK," What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?",140
14923,GEORGE, What are you doing here?,140
14924,KRAMER," Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.",140
14925,JERRY," Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?",140
14926,KRAMER," Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?",140
14927,FRANK," Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!",140
14928,KRAMER, What's the matter with him?,140
14929,GEORGE," My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.",140
14930,KRAMER, Shell-shocked?,140
14931,GEORGE," Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.",140
14932,ELAINE," That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.",140
14933,EDDIE, Wait. You didn't ask me about my ideas.,140
14934,ELAINE," Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day.",140
14935,EDDIE, I'm ready.,140
14936,ELAINE," Oh, okay.",140
14937,EDDIT,"  It's a hot night. The mind races. You think about your knife; the only friend who hasn't betrayed you, the only friend who won't be dead by sun up. Sleep tight, mates, in your quilted Chambray nightshirts.",140
14938,ELAINE, What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.,140
14939,JERRY," Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.",140
14940,ELAINE," You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.",140
14941,GEORGE, Nothing at all.,140
14942,DOCTOR," Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this insurance form, here's a pen.",140
14943,GEORGE," You're a very handsome man, by the way.",140
14944,JERRY, What the hell is going on here?,140
14945,JERRY, What are you doing?,140
14946,KRAMER," I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.",140
14947,JERRY," No, I don't want to.",140
14948,KRAMER," Eat, eat! You're skin and bones.",140
14949,KRAMER, Hah?,140
14950,JERRY," Oh, this is awful.",140
14951,KRAMER," Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.",140
14952,JERRY, Did you follow the recipe?,140
14953,KRAMER, The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.,140
14954,JERRY, It tastes like dirt.,140
14955,KRAMER," Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.",140
14956,JERRY," Kramer, you can't talk to Frank.",140
14957,KRAMER," No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.",140
14958,ABBY, I think there's a dead animal in the elevator.,140
14959,KRAMER, My stuffed cabbage!,140
14960,ABBY," So, great dinner last night.",140
14961,JERRY," Yeah, it was alright.",140
14962,ABBY, I told Cynthia we'd double with her and Bania Saturday and then catch his act.,140
14963,JERRY," No. No, no way, no Bania.",140
14964,ABBY, What?,140
14965,JERRY," Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.",140
14966,ABBY, Cynthia would not date a hack.,140
14967,JERRY, Would. Does. Is.,140
14968,ELAINE," Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.",140
14969,ELAINE," He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.",140
14970,EMPLOYEE, You promoted him?,140
14971,ELAINE," Well, no, I would hardly--",140
14972,EMPLOYEE, I bust my hump ever day.,140
14973,ELAINE, Relax--,140
14974,EMPLOYEE," As far as I'm concerned, you and your deranged protégé can run the catalog by yourselves! I quit!",140
14975,ELAINE," Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!",140
14976,VOICE, Chapter one. In order to manage risk we must first understand risk. How do you spot risk? How do you avoid risk and what makes it so risky?,140
14977,GEORGE, This guy sounds just like me.,140
14978,VOICE," To understand risk, we must first define risk.",140
14979,GEORGE, This is horrible.,140
14980,VOICE, Risk is defined as--,140
14981,GEORGE,  Stop it! Stop it!,140
14982,KRAMER," C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.",140
14983,FRANK," In my mind, there's a war still going on.",140
14984,KRAMER," Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?",140
14985,FRANK," Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough...",140
14986,KRAMER, What happened?,140
14987,FRANK," I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys.",140
14988,KRAMER," Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.",140
14989,FRANK," Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!",140
14990,KRAMER," Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.",140
14991,FRANK," No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go.",140
14992,JERRY, So you saw Bania's act?,140
14993,ABBY, He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldn't take it anymore.,140
14994,JERRY," I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.",140
14995,ABBY, Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine?,140
14996,JERRY, He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.,140
14997,ABBY," Anyway, Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and I think it's over.",140
14998,JERRY, No more mentor?,140
14999,ABBY, Looks that way.,140
15000,JERRY, Well at least you and I are okay again.,140
15001,ABBY, Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn't see each other for a while.,140
15002,JERRY, Why?,140
15003,ABBY, Well I'm feeling a little disoriented. It's just weird for me not to have an advisor.,140
15004,JERRY, I can tell you what to do.,140
15005,ABBY," No, it's more than that.",140
15006,JERRY, I can tell you what to think.,140
15007,ABBY, I need someone I can trust.,140
15008,JERRY, Oh.,140
15009,GEORGE," I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.",140
15010,JERRY," Kind of in the middle of something here, George.",140
15011,JERRY, George?,140
15012,ABBY, I gotta run anyway.,140
15013,JERRY, I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.,140
15014,ABBY, I just need someone who can give me some kind of direction. I'll see ya.,140
15015,JERRY," Yeah, see ya.",140
15016,JERRY, What's your problem.,140
15017,GEORGE, No problem.,140
15018,EDDIE," Hey, I think I got something here. The Bengalese Galoshes.",140
15019,ELAINE, Oh.,140
15020,EDDIE,  It's tough keeping your feet dry when you're kicking in a skull.,140
15021,ELAINE," You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.",140
15022,EDDIE," Well, I'm not married to it.",140
15023,EDDIE, Dewy meadow.,140
15024,ESTELLE, Here's your omelet.,140
15025,FRANK, It's dry.,140
15026,ESTELLE, That's the way I always make it.,140
15027,FRANK, Well it sucks.,140
15028,ESTELLE, What did you say?,140
15029,FRANK," Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!",140
15030,ESTELLE," Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!",140
15031,FRANK," Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!",140
15032,ABBY, And you're sure with your busy schedule you'd have time to take on a protégé?,140
15033,GEORGE," I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.",140
15034,ABBY," I'm not familiar with that, you'll have to explain it to me.",140
15035,GEORGE," I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.",140
15036,ABBY, Alright.,140
15037,GEORGE, Okay.,140
15038,BANIA, Hey Jerry.,140
15039,JERRY," Oh, hey Bania.",140
15040,BANIA, Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.,140
15041,JERRY," Oh, that's too bad.",140
15042,BANIA," Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. The worst, Jerry.",140
15043,JERRY," Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestlé's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--",140
15044,BANIA, You think you can give me a hand with my material?,140
15045,KRAMER, Hey.,140
15046,FRANK, You still need a cook?,140
15047,KRAMER," Oh yeah, come on in, Frank.",140
15048,FRANK, Ya got T-Fal?,140
15049,KRAMER, Keflon.,140
15050,FRANK, No! Follow me.,140
15051,BANIA,"  Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!",140
15052,ELAINE," Let's just replace ""hail of shrapnel"" and ""scar tissue"" with ""string of pearls"" and ""raspberry scones"".",140
15053,JERRY, George Costanza is your mentor?,140
15054,ABBY," Yeah, he's great! I am learning so much.",140
15055,JERRY, About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?,140
15056,ABBY, You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the mentor/mentor relationship.,140
15057,JERRY," As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protégé of my own.",140
15058,ABBY, Who?,140
15059,JERRY, A Mister Kenneth Bania.,140
15060,ABBY, Bania?,140
15061,JERRY, I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.,140
15062,ABBY," Huh, well, I don't think I want to date a mentor whose protégé is a hack.",140
15063,JERRY," Well, I don't think I want to date a protégé whose mentor is a Costanza.",140
15064,ELAINE," I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.",140
15065,EDDIE, Cool.,140
15066,ELAINE," Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?",140
15067,EDDIE, I don't want to talk about it.,140
15068,ELAINE," Come on, don't be a baby.",140
15069,EDDIE," I went out on a couple of dates with this woman, I thought she really liked me, and then things kind of cooled off.",140
15070,ELAINE, That's it?,140
15071,EDDIE," Well it's tough meeting somebody you like, let alone somebody Jewish.",140
15072,ELAINE, Mm. This food is fantastic.,140
15073,JERRY, Have you tried the hamentashen?,140
15074,ELAINE, I can't get off the kishkas.,140
15075,BANIA, Hey Jerry!,140
15076,JERRY, Bania?,140
15077,BANIA, I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!,140
15078,JERRY, Risk management?,140
15079,BANIA," Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back.",140
15080,WOMAN, So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days?,140
15081,EDDIE, That's right.,140
15082,WOMAN, How much are they paying you? I'll double it.,140
15083,KRAMER, Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.,140
15084,FRANK, Where's the powdered sugar?,140
15085,KRAMER," You know Frank, you could take a break.",140
15086,FRANK," No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.",140
15087,ELAINE, You're quitting?,140
15088,EDDIE, I can't churn out that pointless drivel any more.,140
15089,ELAINE," Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!",140
15090,VOICE, Our next speaker is George Costanza on the subject of risk management.,140
15091,GEORGE, Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?,140
15092,GEORGE, They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.,140
15093,WILHELM, He's my protégé.,140
15094,FRANK," Noooo!!! Don't eat it! No good!""",140
15095,JERRY," Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.",141
15096,ELAINE," Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.",141
15097,JERRY," Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?",141
15098,ELAINE," What is this, a 'bit'?",141
15099,JERRY, No.,141
15100,ELAINE, 'Cos I'm not in the mood.,141
15101,JERRY," We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!",141
15102,ELAINE," Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.",141
15103,JERRY, They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.,141
15104,ELAINE,"  Alright, are you done with your little amusement?",141
15105,JERRY,  Then you admit it was amusing?,141
15106,ELAINE," It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.",141
15107,JERRY,  Great. Thanks.,141
15108,ELAINE," So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?",141
15109,BRETT, We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.,141
15110,ELAINE,"  Oh, Farbman.",141
15111,BRETT, You know Farbman?,141
15112,ELAINE," Mm, love Farbman.",141
15113,BRETT, Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman.,141
15114,ELAINE," Wuh, if you call that living.  Ahaha.",141
15115,ELAINE, Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?,141
15116,ELAINE, Brett? Don't you think that would be great?,141
15117,ELAINE, Brett?,141
15118,BRETT,"  After the song, babe.",141
15119,ELAINE, Huh?,141
15120,BRETT, The song.,141
15121,JERRY, So when do I meet this jerk?,141
15122,ELAINE," He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.",141
15123,JERRY, Who?,141
15124,ELAINE,"  I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.",141
15125,JERRY, What song?,141
15126,ELAINE, Desperado.,141
15127,JERRY, Desperado?,141
15128,ELAINE, Uh huh.,141
15129,JERRY, And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.,141
15130,JERRY,"  See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.",141
15131,ELAINE, Uh huh.,141
15132,JERRY, I invented that.,141
15133,ELAINE," That, had to be invented?",141
15134,JERRY," When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.",141
15135,ELAINE,"  Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?",141
15136,JERRY, Elaine.,141
15137,ELAINE," Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.",141
15138,JERRY," Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.",141
15139,CLICKY, Teddy Padillac came up with this twirl.,141
15140,ELAINE,  Ohh.,141
15141,JERRY, I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.,141
15142,CLICKY," Yeah, that's where he come up with it.",141
15143,JERRY, In his dreams.,141
15144,ELAINE," Alright, can we  go?",141
15145,JERRY,"  By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.",141
15146,JERRY, It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.,141
15147,GEORGE,  I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.,141
15148,JERRY,  Those belong to people.,141
15149,KRAMER, Hey. Well.  This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.,141
15150,JERRY,"  Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.",141
15151,GEORGE, What checks?,141
15152,KRAMER," Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.",141
15153,JERRY, I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.,141
15154,KRAMER," Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.",141
15155,JERRY,"  They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.",141
15156,GEORGE, Look at all of those! You're rich!,141
15157,JERRY, Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.,141
15158,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?",141
15159,JERRY, Why?,141
15160,KRAMER,"  Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.",141
15161,GEORGE, He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?,141
15162,JERRY," Ah, who are any of her losers?",141
15163,GEORGE,  You're on that list.,141
15164,GEORGE," Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.",141
15165,KRAMER," Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?",141
15166,EGO," Yeah, you heard of 'em?",141
15167,KRAMER, They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.,141
15168,GEORGE," So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.",141
15169,JERRY," I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.",141
15170,JERRY, Signed over a hundred checks this morning.,141
15171,KRAMER," Hello, twelve dollars.",141
15172,MR OH, Excuse me. Would you take picture please?,141
15173,KRAMER,"  Oh, yeah, sure.",141
15174,JERRY, I'm gonna ask this guy something.,141
15175,JERRY,"  Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?",141
15176,KRAMER,"  Hey, are you folks from Japan.",141
15177,MR YAMAGUCHI, Hai.,141
15178,MR OH, Yes.,141
15179,KRAMER,  You recognise that mug?,141
15180,KRAMER, That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.,141
15181,MR OH," Ahh, Super Terrific Happy...",141
15182,KRAMER," Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him.",141
15183,MR OH, What is he doing?,141
15184,KRAMER," Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.",141
15185,MR OH, He's funny.,141
15186,KRAMER," Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.",141
15187,KRAMER," Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.",141
15188,CREW LEADER,  We're pretty much finished.,141
15189,CREW LEADER, There's just one more thing.,141
15190,GEORGE,  Here it comes.,141
15191,CREW LEADER,  You forgot to sign your check.,141
15192,GEORGE,"  Sorry.  You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?",141
15193,CREW LEADER,  No.,141
15194,GEORGE,"  So, that's it?",141
15195,CREW LEADER, Unless you need a receipt.,141
15196,GEORGE,"  I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.",141
15197,CREW LEADER,  Good luck with that.,141
15198,JERRY, Hey.,141
15199,ELAINE, What's with the claw?,141
15200,JERRY, Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.,141
15201,BRETT,  There's no sign of Kramer.,141
15202,ELAINE," Oh, Brett.  This is Jerry.",141
15203,JERRY, Hi.,141
15204,BRETT, That's very funny. Elaine told me you were some kinda comedian.,141
15205,JERRY," Ah, I'm one kind.",141
15206,ELAINE, Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?,141
15207,JERRY, The Fleckman.,141
15208,BRETT, Farbman.,141
15209,JERRY, Right.,141
15210,ELAINE, You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.,141
15211,JERRY,"  Oh, I'm sure they are.",141
15212,BRETT, I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at.,141
15213,JERRY," No. I'm fine, thank you.",141
15214,BRETT, Don't worry. It's no charge to you.,141
15215,BRETT, Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your skits.,141
15216,JERRY,  I don't write skits.,141
15217,BRETT,"  Well, of course you don't. You don't have a proper workstation. I'll fax you over my catalogue.",141
15218,ELAINE," Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.",141
15219,BRETT,  Oops.,141
15220,BRETT," Well, I'm sure things'll pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we should get going.",141
15221,ELAINE," Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?",141
15222,JERRY," Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?",141
15223,BRETT,  Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant.,141
15224,JERRY, You look like you could use a...,141
15225,ELAINE,  Jerry.,141
15226,KRAMER,"  Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?",141
15227,MR OH,"  Ahh, about, uh, thirty thousand yen.",141
15228,KRAMER,  Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.,141
15229,KRAMER, Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.,141
15230,BRETT," I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave Kramer that chest of drawers, isn't he?",141
15231,ELAINE, Why? Why d'you think he's upset?,141
15232,BRETT," How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like.",141
15233,ELAINE,"  We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?",141
15234,BRETT,  I hope not.,141
15235,ELAINE,  Brett? Everything alright?,141
15236,ELAINE,  Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?,141
15237,BRETT," Elaine, the song.",141
15238,ELAINE,"  Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...",141
15239,BRETT," Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute?",141
15240,ELAINE,  Sorry.,141
15241,JERRY, No spiel?,141
15242,GEORGE,  Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!,141
15243,JERRY, So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?,141
15244,GEORGE, They could've at least tried!,141
15245,JERRY," You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?",141
15246,GEORGE, Please.,141
15247,JERRY, Too dumb?,141
15248,JERRY,  Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.,141
15249,KRAMER," Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends.  They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.",141
15250,JERRY, Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.,141
15251,KRAMER," Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?",141
15252,KRAMER, That's right.,141
15253,GEORGE, How'd you hook up with these guys?,141
15254,KRAMER," Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.",141
15255,JERRY, What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?,141
15256,KRAMER,"  Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.",141
15257,GEORGE,"  Yeah, the pilot!",141
15258,KRAMER," That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.",141
15259,GEORGE,"  And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!",141
15260,JERRY, Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.,141
15261,GEORGE,"  It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!",141
15262,KRAMER," George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.",141
15263,TV JERRY, You had a date? You went out with my butler?! Who said you could go out with my butler?!,141
15264,TV ELAINE," Well, why do I need your permission?",141
15265,TV JERRY, Because he's my butler.,141
15266,GEORGE,  So? What d'you think?,141
15267,GEORGE," Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.",141
15268,JERRY, No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.,141
15269,GEORGE," Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long.  You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.",141
15270,JERRY,  Sorry. My hand is numb.,141
15271,GEORGE,  Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. ,141
15272,ELAINE," Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.",141
15273,JERRY,  What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?,141
15274,ELAINE," He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.",141
15275,JERRY," You know, what you need is a song you can share.",141
15276,ELAINE, Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.,141
15277,JERRY," Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?",141
15278,ELAINE,  I like Witchy Woman.,141
15279,JERRY, Witchy Woman?,141
15280,ELAINE," You know, Witchy Woman.  'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.",141
15281,JERRY,  Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.,141
15282,KRAMER,"  Hey, man.",141
15283,ELAINE, Hey.,141
15284,JERRY, Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?,141
15285,KRAMER," Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.",141
15286,JERRY, Ah.,141
15287,KRAMER," Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?",141
15288,JERRY, What for?,141
15289,KRAMER ," Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.",141
15290,JERRY, I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?,141
15291,KRAMER," Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.",141
15292,JERRY," Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?",141
15293,KRAMER," Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.",141
15294,ELAINE, Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?,141
15295,KRAMER," Evidently.  Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.",141
15296,ELAINE, In them?!,141
15297,JERRY, You have them sleeping in drawers?!,141
15298,KRAMER," Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.",141
15299,JERRY, This has 'international incident' written all over it.,141
15300,KRAMER,"  Oh yeah, yeah.",141
15301,KRAMER," Goodnight, Mr Tanaka.",141
15302,MR TANAKA, Goodnight.,141
15303,KRAMER," Goodnight, Mr Oh.",141
15304,MR OH,  Goodnight.,141
15305,KRAMER," Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi.MR YAMAGUCHI",141
15306,JERRY, What is this?,141
15307,KRAMER," Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry.",141
15308,JERRY," Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.",141
15309,KRAMER,  Sayonara.,141
15310,JERRY,  Konichi-wa.,141
15311,BRETT," Elaine, I...",141
15312,ELAINE, Shh-shh!  What d'you think?,141
15313,ELAINE, What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.,141
15314,BRETT," Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song.",141
15315,ELAINE," Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado?  We can share it.",141
15316,BRETT,  No. It's mine.,141
15317,KRAMER," Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop.",141
15318,KRAMER,"  Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.",141
15319,MR OH ," Ach, come back in half hour.",141
15320,JERRY,"  Hey, I'll take one.",141
15321,CLICKY," Well, look who's back!",141
15322,CLICKY, Teddy!  This's the guy says he invented the twirl.,141
15323,TEDDY,  Jerry Seinfeld!,141
15324,JERRY," Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see.  What've you got in a push-button mini.",141
15325,TEDDY,"  Same thing we had, when you bailed on us, fifteen years ago.",141
15326,JERRY," Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?",141
15327,TEDDY,"  Oh, yeah, sure. But where were you during the poncho craze of eighty-four? I almost lost my house.",141
15328,CLICKY," Umbrella, buddy?",141
15329,CLICKY, Now we got that damn 'urban sombrero' to contend with.,141
15330,TEDDY,"  Easy, there.  I hear you're taking credit for the twirl.",141
15331,JERRY," Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?",141
15332,TEDDY,  I care. Clicky cares.,141
15333,JERRY," So, could I...",141
15334,JERRY, Could I just buy an umbrella?,141
15335,TEDDY,"  Yeah, sure. Two hundred dollars.",141
15336,JERRY,  What?!,141
15337,TEDDY,"  Special price, for a real foul-weather friend.",141
15338,KRAMER," Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.",141
15339,GEORGE,"  Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.",141
15340,KRAMER,"  Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.",141
15341,GEORGE," Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.",141
15342,KRAMER,"  That's perfect.  Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?",141
15343,MR OH," But, we are also very hungry.",141
15344,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.",141
15345,KRAMER,"  Hey, peanuts!",141
15346,WILHELM, George.  George.,141
15347,WILHELM,"  Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?",141
15348,GEORGE, Are they here?,141
15349,WILHELM," They're in my office, right now.",141
15350,GEORGE,"  They haven't said anything to you, have they?",141
15351,WILHELM, About what?,141
15352,GEORGE,"  What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!",141
15353,BRETT,  Hey Jerry!,141
15354,JERRY," Oh, hi Brett.",141
15355,BRETT, Haven't you ever heard of an umbrella?,141
15356,JERRY," Ah, I didn't have enough money.",141
15357,BRETT, I'm sure things'll pick up for you.,141
15358,JERRY," No, it's not that, it's the...",141
15359,JERRY," Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!",141
15360,BRETT," Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the  twelve cents?",141
15361,JERRY," No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.",141
15362,BRETT," Nothing's working for you, is is?",141
15363,JERRY,"  Not at the moment, Brett.",141
15364,BRETT," I'd give you a ride, but I got Karl Farbman here.",141
15365,JERRY,  Thanks for stopping!,141
15366,ELAINE," Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.",141
15367,JERRY, Boogeyman.,141
15368,ELAINE, Boogey?,141
15369,JERRY," I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?",141
15370,ELAINE," No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?",141
15371,JERRY,  Eehh.,141
15372,ELAINE,"  Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!",141
15373,JERRY, Hey.,141
15374,GEORGE,  Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!,141
15375,JERRY, Really? They bought the butler character?,141
15376,GEORGE,  Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.,141
15377,JERRY, NBC?,141
15378,GEORGE,  Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.,141
15379,JERRY, Ah. But they told us we must go now.,141
15380,GEORGE," But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.",141
15381,JERRY," Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is.  Just take it!",141
15382,GEORGE," Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?",141
15383,JERRY, Who?,141
15384,GEORGE, The network executive. You think she liked me?,141
15385,KRAMER, Heyy! Look who's here.,141
15386,KRAMER,"  Come on, I want you to come in here.",141
15387,MR OH," Come on in, fat boy!",141
15388,GEORGE," Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas.  Big day tomorrow!",141
15389,JERRY,  Last one.,141
15390,JERRY,  Uugh! Ahh.,141
15391,KRAMER, There you are.,141
15392,GEORGE, Uh.  Where's the boys?,141
15393,KRAMER," Uh, no, I let 'em sleep in.",141
15394,KRAMER, I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.,141
15395,GEORGE,  But that meeting starts in ten minutes!,141
15396,KRAMER," No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.",141
15397,GEORGE,  I'm calling Jerry.,141
15398,JERRY, Yeah?,141
15399,GEORGE,"  Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!",141
15400,JERRY,  Uncle Leo?,141
15401,GEORGE,  Jerry!!,141
15402,JERRY," Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up.",141
15403,JERRY,"  Hmm, testy.",141
15404,JERRY, Hello?,141
15405,MR OH ," Mr Jerry! Open the drawer, please!",141
15406,JERRY, It's stuck.  Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.,141
15407,MR OH , Pull harder.,141
15408,JERRY, I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.,141
15409,MR OH ," Very funny, but no joking, please.",141
15410,JERRY,"  Don't worry, I'll get you out.",141
15411,ELAINE," Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.",141
15412,BRETT," Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this. Granted, it's not as nice as Kramer's cabinet, but it's start.",141
15413,ELAINE," Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.",141
15414,JERRY ,  Move to the back of the drawers!,141
15415,ELAINE, Jerry?,141
15416,ELAINE, Jerry.,141
15417,BRETT,  Not the Farbman!!,141
15418,MR OH,  SUBTITLE,141
15419,GEORGE," So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?",141
15420,MR OH,  SUBTITLE,141
15421,MR OH,  SUBTITLE,141
15422,GEORGE,  Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?,141
15423,GEORGE, Mr Wilhelm? Wha..what're you doing here?,141
15424,WILHELM," I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And, one day, we will do the cleaning.",141
15425,GEORGE,  Him you brainwashed!  What's he got that I don't have?!,141
15426,GEORGE,"  Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!",141
15427,WILHELM, Wilhelm?  My name is Tanya.,141
15428,JERRY,"  Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.",141
15429,JERRY,  At least it was just the handle!,141
15430,BRETT, It was a beautiful cabinet. What am I gonna tell...,141
15431,BRETT, I can't remember his name!,141
15432,JERRY, Fleckman?,141
15433,ELAINE," Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down.  'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'",141
15434,NURSE, His pulse is fine.,141
15435,DOCTOR, Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling.,141
15436,NURSE, Doctor?,141
15437,NURSE,  Doctor?,141
15438,NURSE,  Doctor?,141
15439,NURSE,"  Doctor, I think we're losing him!",141
15440,GEORGE," Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.",143
15441,JERRY, Why are we flyin' over the Andes?,143
15442,GEORGE," We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?",143
15443,JERRY, Kramer.,143
15444,GEORGE, So fast? What about me?,143
15445,JERRY, No.,143
15446,GEORGE," Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.",143
15447,JERRY," Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.",143
15448,GEORGE, Well I would eat you.,143
15449,JERRY," That's very nice, I guess.",143
15450,GEORGE, I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.,143
15451,JERRY," Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.",143
15452,GEORGE, Thank you.,143
15453,JERRY, Can I have a piece of that?,143
15454,GEORGE, No.,143
15455,LOUISE," George, I can't have sex.",143
15456,GEORGE, With me or in general?,143
15457,LOUISE, I went to the doctor today. I have mono.,143
15458,GEORGE, Nucleosis.,143
15459,LOUISE, Oh I hope it's not a problem for you.,143
15460,GEORGE," No, no, pff...",143
15461,LOUISE, How long is this not gonna be a problem for me?,143

15463,GEORGE," Yeah, six weeks.",143
15464,JERRY," Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.",143
15465,GEORGE, I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.,143
15466,JERRY," Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?",143
15467,GEORGE, I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.,143
15468,JERRY, What guys?,143
15469,GEORGE, Like us. ,143
15470,JERRY, Yeah.,143
15471,GEORGE, So it's just mono.,143
15472,ELAINE," Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.",143
15473,JERRY, I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.,143
15474,ELAINE," No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.",143
15475,JERRY," Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.",143
15476,GEORGE, No something is bunk and then you debunk it.,143
15477,JERRY, What?,143
15478,ELAINE, Huh?,143
15479,GEORGE, I think. ,143
15480,ELAINE," Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. ",143

15491,GEORGE, They asked you to do career day?,143
15492,JERRY," Yeah, it's no big deal.",143
15493,GEORGE," Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.",143
15494,JERRY, And you were integral.,143
15495,TEACHER," Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here.",143
15496,JERRY," I'm on next, right?",143
15497,TEACHER," Well, unfortunately, Mr. O'Meary from the Bronx zoo...",143
15498,JERRY, The guy with the lizard.,143
15499,TEACHER," Yes. Well, he started feedin' it crickets, and the children just love him. And we're outta time.",143
15500,TEACHER, So can you come back tomorrow?,143
15501,JERRY, I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?,143
15502,ELAINE, So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?,143
15503,BEN," I couldn't tell you. You know, I'm not really a doctor.",143
15504,ELAINE," Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.",143
15505,BEN," Well, I'm serious, Elaine. I went to medical school, but I still have to pass my licensing exam.",143
15506,ELAINE, When do you take this exam?,143
15507,BEN, I've taken it. Three times. I almost passed the last one.,143
15508,ELAINE," Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.",143
15509,BEN," Well, um...",143

15512,ELAINE," All right, that's all I wanted to know.",143
15513,LOUISE, Mono. ,143
15514,GEORGE," It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.",143
15515,JERRY, So you're enjoying the not enjoying.,143
15516,GEORGE," you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.",143
15517,JERRY, I'm finding that out. ,143
15518,KRAMER," Hey, buddy. How was career day?",143
15519,JERRY," Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.",143
15520,GEORGE, You got bumped from career day?,143
15521,JERRY," It was a mix-up, I'm sure.",143
15522,KRAMER, They're trying to screw with your head.,143
15523,JERRY, Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?,143
15524,KRAMER, Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.,143
15525,GEORGE," Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.",143
15526,KRAMER," No, come on. ",143
15527,LARRY, Take it outside.,143
15528,KRAMER," Come on, Larry. You know me.",143
15529,LARRY," It bothers people, and it's against the law.",143
15530,JERRY," You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.",143
15531,KRAMER," What, did they kick you out too?",143
15532,MAN," Yeah, they kicked us all out.",143
15533,TEACHER," Thanks so much for coming back, Jerry. Care for a graham cracker?",143
15534,JERRY," No, let's just do it.  What? What is going on? What is that about?",143
15535,TEACHER, Fire drill. Sorry. Single file everyone!,143
15536,JERRY, But I was promised this slot.,143
15537,TEACHER," Single file, Jerry. ",143
15538,JERRY," Fire drill, can you believe that?",143
15539,GEORGE, What is Pericles?,143
15540,ALEX TREBEK, Pericles is correct.,143
15541,JERRY, Like fire in a school is such a big deal. ,143
15542,KRAMER," Hey, you got any matches?",143
15543,JERRY, Middle drawer.,143
15544,GEORGE, Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?,143

15547,JERRY, Hello?,143
15548,KATIE, Jerry.,143
15549,JERRY," Oh hi, Katie.",143

15551,JERRY," Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem.",143
15552,GEORGE, What is Borax?,143
15553,ALEX TREBEK," Yes, you're right.",143
15554,KATIE," They bump you in junior high, the next thing you know you're being bumped in high schools, colleges, trade schools. Before you know it, Letterman's not returning your calls. ",143
15555,KRAMER, Ashtrays?,143
15556,JERRY," No, I don't have any ashtrays.",143
15557,KRAMER," Ooh, cereal bowls.",143
15558,KATIE," Jerry, now don't freak out, I'll take care of it.",143

15560,KRAMER," All right, thanks. ",143
15561,GEORGE, What is Tungsten or Wolfram?,143
15562,ALEX TREBEK," We were looking for 'What is Tungsten, or Wolfram'.",143
15563,JERRY, Is this a repeat?,143
15564,GEORGE," No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon,  what is chicken Kiev,  I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.",143
15565,JERRY," Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.",143
15566,GEORGE, You think?,143
15567,JERRY," Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain.  Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts",143
15568,GEORGE, Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. ,143
15569,KRAMER, Need some more matches.,143
15570,JERRY, What is goin' on in there?,143
15571,KRAMER," I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.",143
15572,JERRY, Why?,143
15573,KRAMER," Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.",143
15574,JERRY, It doesn't?,143
15575,KRAMER," Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.",143
15576,JERRY, All right.,143
15577,KRAMER, Yeah.,143
15578,ELAINE," So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?",143
15579,BEN, I dunno. Dead bodies really gross me out. ,143
15580,ELAINE, Oh my God.,143
15581,BEN, What's wrong?,143
15582,ELAINE," It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. ",143
15583,SUE ELLEN, Elaine? Hi.,143
15584,ELAINE," Oh hi, Sue Ellen.",143
15585,SUE ELLEN," Oh Rick, this is an old, old, friend of mine, Elaine Benes. Rick is a periodontist. He does Giuliani's gums.",143
15586,ELAINE," Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.",143
15587,BEN," Well, I'm an intern.",143
15588,ELAINE," Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.",143
15589,WOMAN, Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help?,143
15590,ELAINE," Well, there's a doctor right here.",143
15591,BEN, No there's not.,143
15592,ELAINE, Can't you at least tell him what to do?,143
15593,BEN, Like what?,143
15594,SUE ELLEN, Shouldn't he elevate his legs?,143
15595,BEN, Right. Elevate your legs!,143
15596,ELAINE, I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.,143
15597,LARRY, I thought he was a doctor.,143
15598,ELAINE," Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor.  George. ",143
15599,GEORGE, Of course. Absolute zero!,143
15600,ELAINE, What? What is with all these books?,143
15601,GEORGE, I stopped having sex.,143
15602,KRAMER," All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section.  Hey.",143
15603,JERRY," Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?",143
15604,KRAMER," Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. ",143
15605,KATIE," Jerry, oh there you are. You didn't answer the phone.",143
15606,JERRY, I was out.,143
15607,KATIE," Oh. Jerry, great news. I got you an assembly.",143
15608,JERRY, An assembly?,143
15609,KATIE," Two hours in front of the entire junior high, grades six through eight. That's six grade, seventh grade--",143
15610,JERRY, I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?,143
15611,KATIE," And, it is already in the school paper. They cancelled Rick James.",143
15612,JERRY, Superfreak?,143
15613,KATIE, Yes.,143
15614,ELAINE, What is your answer to number 74?,143
15615,BEN, Medobolic acidosis.,143
15616,ELAINE," No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!",143
15617,BEN," Man, I'm never gonna pass this thing.",143
15618,ELAINE, Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.,143
15619,GEORGE," Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant.  It's not complicated.",143
15620,JETER, Now who are you again?,143
15621,GEORGE," George Costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary.",143
15622,WILLIAMS, Are you the guy who put us in that Ramada in Milwaukee?,143
15623,GEORGE," Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?",143
15624,JETER, We won the World Series.,143
15625,GEORGE, In six games.,143
15626,JERRY," ...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.",143
15627,GEORGE, Nine minutes.,143
15628,JERRY, How am I gonna fill two hours?,143
15629,GEORGE, Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.,143
15630,JERRY, And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. ,143
15631,WAITRESS, More coffee?,143
15632,GEORGE," Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?",143
15633,WAITRESS, Si,143
15634,GEORGE, Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.,143
15635,WAITRESS, Mute pragalas senor,143
15636,GEORGE," Eh, don't mention it.",143
15637,ELAINE, Portuguese?,143
15638,GEORGE," Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.",143
15639,ELAINE, How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?,143
15640,JERRY, Are you all right?,143
15641,ELAINE," I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.",143
15642,JERRY," Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.",143
15643,ELAINE, What? What are you talking about?,143
15644,JERRY," To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.",143
15645,ELAINE, I don't understand.,143
15646,JERRY, Exactly.,143
15647,KRAMER, Hey buddy.,143
15648,JERRY, Hey.,143
15649,KRAMER," Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.",143
15650,JERRY, What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.,143
15651,KRAMER," What?  My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.",143
15652,JERRY, It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?,143
15653,KRAMER," Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.",143
15654,JERRY," And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.",143
15655,KRAMER," Look away, I'm hideous.",143
15656,ELAINE," Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.",143
15657,BEN, Pooh!,143
15658,ELAINE, Pooh...,143
15659,BEN," No, it's Winnie the Pooh.",143
15660,LOUISE," So the hospital called, turns out some stupid intern screwed up my test. I never had mono. So we can... you know.",143
15661,JERRY, So what did you do?,143
15662,GEORGE, I told her I would have to think about it.,143
15663,JERRY," But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?",143
15664,GEORGE, I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.,143
15665,JERRY," You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.",143
15666,GEORGE, Simple joke from a simple man.,143
15667,JERRY, So you're never gonna have sex again?,143
15668,GEORGE," Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.",143
15669,JERRY, So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?,143
15670,GEORGE," Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.",143
15671,JERRY, I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.,143
15672,JACKIE," My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu.",143
15673,JACKIE, Oh no.,143
15674,KRAMER, Jackie we gotta talk.,143
15675,JACKIE," No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out.",143
15676,KRAMER, But Jackie--,143
15677,JACKIE, I said out.,143
15678,KRAMER," Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.",143
15679,JACKIE, The who?,143
15680,KRAMER, The tobacco companies.,143
15681,JACKIE, I've been wanting a piece of them for years.,143
15682,JACKIE, Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?,143
15683,KRAMER," No, it didn't say anything.",143
15684,JACKIE," So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting.",143
15685,KRAMER," So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?",143
15686,JACKIE, Your face is my case.,143
15687,JERRY, How ya doin'?,143
15688,ELAINE, Not good. I'm a moron.,143
15689,JERRY," Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.",143
15690,ELAINE," Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?",143
15691,JERRY, What for? Oh come on.,143
15692,ELAINE, I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.,143
15693,JERRY, I think it has something to do with me.,143
15694,ELAINE, You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.,143
15695,JERRY,"  No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.",143
15696,ELAINE," Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?",143
15697,GEORGE," You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--",143
15698,LOUISE," George, I have to have sex.",143
15699,GEORGE," I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.",143
15700,LOUISE," Goodbye, George. I hate you. ",143
15701,GEORGE, What a fascinating turn of events. ,143
15702,WAITRESS, Mas Café?,143
15703,GEORGE," Si, por favor.",143
15704,JACKIE," Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak.",143
15705,KRAMER, Who could love me?,143
15706,WILKIE," I disagree. In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer projects a rugged masculinity.",143
15707,JACKIE," Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.",143
15708,WILKIE," All right, Mr. Chiles. You'll have our offer by tomorrow. Good day, gentlemen. ",143
15709,KRAMER," Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich.",143
15710,JACKIE, You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.,143
15711,ELAINE, Congratulations! You passed!,143
15712,BEN," Elaine, Elaine. I don't think we should see each other anymore.",143
15713,ELAINE, What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?,143
15714,BEN," I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew that after I became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor.",143
15715,ELAINE," Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?",143
15716,KATIE," Okay, Jerry, now when the glee club's finished singing, George goes on, then you. ",143
15717,GEORGE, Hey.,143
15718,JERRY," Where have you been? You know, you're on next.",143
15719,GEORGE, I got lost on the way over.,143
15720,JERRY, Got lost? We went to school here for three years.,143
15721,GEORGE, What are these?  Take me to your leader.,143
15722,JERRY, Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!,143
15723,GEORGE," No, the Portuguese waitress.",143
15724,JERRY, The Portuguese waitress?,143
15725,GEORGE," I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.",143
15726,KATIE," George, George, you're on.",143
15727,GEORGE," No, no. I'm not going on.",143
15728,JERRY, Then what'd you come down here for?,143
15729,GEORGE, Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.,143
15730,JERRY, It's good to have you back.,143
15731,KATIE, One of you has to go on.,143
15732,JERRY," All right, I'll do it.  Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! ",143
15733,KRAMER," It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks.",143
15734,JACKIE, It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.,143
15735,KRAMER," Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.",143
15736,JACKIE, A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.,143
15737,KRAMER, She made an offer. I took it.,143
15738,JACKIE, How much?,143
15739,KRAMER," No, no, no. There was no money.",143
15740,JACKIE, No money? Then what'd we get?,143
15741,KRAMER, Check it out. ,143
15742,JACKIE, This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.,143
15743,JERRY, Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.,143
15744,LETTERMAN," Yeah, but then, you know, some people were telling me about that little flap out there at the junior high assembly. And before that, you were bumped by a lizard?",143
15745,JERRY," Actually, it was a ********.",143
15746,LETTERMAN," those things, deadly dangerous. A long time ago my uncle and a date are driving, like, through Mexico. They see one on the road, drags him out of the road, and chews his face off. Listen, we'll call you if anything opens up. Okay, Jimmy?",143
15747,JERRY, Jerry.,143
15748,LETTERMAN, Right. Jerry.,143
15749,GEORGE, Jerry!  Georgie's moving out!,144
15750,JERRY,  Get out!,144
15751,GEORGE," I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.",144
15752,JERRY,  Is it better than mine?,144
15753,GEORGE,  Oh yeah.,144
15754,JERRY," So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?",144
15755,GEORGE," You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. ",144
15756,JERRY, She's out.,144
15757,GEORGE,"  Oh right, the blind date.",144
15758,JERRY," Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.",144
15759,GEORGE, Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.,144
15760,JERRY, I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.,144
15761,GEORGE,"  Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. ",144
15762,JERRY,"  Oh, this is really annoying.",144
15763,GEORGE,  It's working already! ,144
15764,JERRY,  What is with that?!,144
15765,KRAMER," Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. ",144
15766,JERRY,  Where is your key?,144
15767,KRAMER," Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.",144
15768,JERRY," You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.",144
15769,KRAMER," Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. ",144
15770,JERRY,  Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?,144
15771,KRAMER,  Evidently.,144
15772,RICARDI," Excuse me, George? ",144
15773,GEORGE,"  Yeah, uh, no menus. ",144
15774,RICARDI,"  No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi - president of the tenant's association.",144
15775,GEORGE," Oh, right!  Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball",144
15776,RICARDI," No, no..  Uh, George, unfortunately, Clarance Eldridge in 8C has decided that he wants the apartment.",144
15777,GEORGE,"  Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.",144
15778,RICARDI," Yes, but, you see - Mister Eldridge is an Andrea Doria survivor. And, in light of the terrible suffering that he's already been through, we've decided to give it to him.",144
15779,GEORGE,"  Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. ",144
15780,RICARDI,  Shipwreck.,144
15781,GEORGE, I remember.. ,144
15782,ELAINE," Where is this guy?!  I hate this!  I shoulda brought something to read..  ""Cancer in labratory animals"".. huh.",144
15783,WAITER," Excuse me, Elaine Benes?",144
15784,ELAINE, Yeah?,144
15785,WAITER," An Alan Mercer called for you. He said he's sorry, but he won't be able to make it tonight.  He's been stabbed.",144
15786,ELAINE,  Stabbed?!,144
15787,WAITER, More bread?,144
15788,JERRY,  You ate more bread?,144
15789,ELAINE, That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!,144
15790,JERRY, Did you find out who stabbed him?,144
15791,ELAINE," Yeah,  It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.",144
15792,JERRY,"  Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.",144
15793,ELAINE," Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion.  I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.",144
15794,JERRY,"  Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.",144
15795,KRAMER,  Hey. How's everybody? ,144
15796,JERRY, Hey.,144
15797,ELAINE, Hey.,144
15798,KRAMER, Ehh..  No expiration date on this.. ,144
15799,JERRY," There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.",144
15800,KRAMER,"  Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line..  Plus, the botched my vasectimy.",144
15801,JERRY,  The botched it?,144
15802,KRAMER,  I'm even more potent now!,144
15803,GEORGE, Hey.,144
15804,JERRY, Hey. How's the new place?!,144
15805,GEORGE, Gone.  The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..,144
15806,ELAINE, Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?,144
15807,JERRY,  Edmund Fitzgerald.,144
15808,ELANE, I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.,144
15809,JERRY,"  No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.",144
15810,GEORGE,  You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..,144
15811,ELAINE, I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.,144
15812,JERRY,"  Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.",144
15813,KRAMER,  The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. ,144
15814,GEORGE, How do you know?,144
15815,KRAMER," it's in my book - ""Astonishing Tales of the Sea"" 51 people died.",144
15816,GEORGE," 51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!",144
15817,KRAMER," There were 1,650 survivors.",144
15818,GEORGE," That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? ",144
15819,KRAMER," Oh yeah. I also got ""Astounding Bear Attacks""",144
15820,JERRY," Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?",144
15821,KRAMER," Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. ",144
15822,JERRY, Newman?,144
15823,NEWMAN,  I guess.,144
15824,JERRY," Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.",144
15825,NEWMAN, Sometimes we don't get what we want.,144
15826,JERRY,  What are you talking about?,144
15827,NEWMAN, I didn't get my transfer.,144
15828,JERRY," ""Transfer""?",144
15829,NEWMAN," To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.",144
15830,JERRY, You quit the post office?,144
15831,NEWMAN," Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.",144
15832,JERRY," Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.",144
15833,NEWMAN," And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.",144
15834,JERRY,"  Well, a law's a law. ",144
15835,KRAMER," Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?",144
15836,MAN, What cough?,144
15837,ELAINE," I love shrimp!  I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me,  and I will eat it until my stomach pops!  Oh.. ",144
15838,ALAN," No, it's okay. I'm.. still just a little bit jumpy.",144
15839,ELAINE,"  Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?",144
15840,ALAN," Just.. one of those things, you know.",144
15841,ELAINE, What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?,144
15842,ALAN, I don't know. Could be.,144
15843,CAROL, Alan?!,144
15844,ALAN, Carol?,144
15845,ELAINE,  Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!,144
15846,ALAN,"  No, that was a different girl.",144
15847,JERRY, There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?,144
15848,ELAINE," Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.",144
15849,JERRY, Mmm.. Bad how?,144
15850,ELAINE,"  Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.",144
15851,JERRY,  I follow. So what are you gonna do?,144
15852,ELAINE," Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.",144
15853,JERRY,  What's more important?,144
15854,KRAMER,  Hey.,144
15855,GEORGE, What's with the dog?,144
15856,KRAMER,"  Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. ",144
15857,GEORGE, Oh..,144
15858,KRAMER,"  Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.",144
15859,GEORGE, A vet?,144
15860,KRAMER," Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a  lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog  - all on the same day.",144
15861,GEORGE," So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?",144
15862,KRAMER,"  You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers?  I'll see ya.",144
15863,GEORGE, Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.,144
15864,ELDRIDGE," Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal.",144
15865,GEORGE," I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships.  The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? ",144
15866,ELDRIDGE,  We had to abandon ship.,144
15867,GEORGE," Well, all vacations have to end eventually.",144
15868,ELDRIDGE, The boat sank.,144
15869,GEORGE,"  According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence.  So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?",144
15870,ELDRIDGE, Is that what this is all about?! I don't think I like you. ,144
15871,GEORGE,"  It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!",144
15872,VET, What are the symptoms?,144
15873,KRAMER," Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice.  I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice.  What's worse - he has a nagging cough.  Yeah, that's it. That's it.",144
15874,VET," Yeah, well, uh - we've been seeing a lot of this lately. Been drinking from the toilet?",144
15875,KRAMER,  What? No. That's disgusting..,144
15876,ALAN," So that's it? We're, uh, we're breakin' up?",144
15877,ELAINE,  What? Break-up? We went out on one date.,144
15878,ALAN,"  Ok, yeah, sure, fine, right. Whatever you say.",144
15879,ELAINE,"  Alright, good. Good.",144
15880,ALAN," Ok, then, well, So.. see ya around.. big head. ",144
15881,ELAINE, Pardon?,144
15882,ALAN, You got a big head. It's too big for your body. ,144
15883,ELAINE,  That's it?!  That's the best you got?! ,144
15884,GEORGE," So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!",144
15885,JERRY," You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the ""Astonishing Tales of Costanza"".",144
15886,GEORGE,  I should!,144
15887,JERRY," I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.",144
15888,GEORGE, I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!,144
15889,JERRY, You're the man!,144
15890,NEWMAN, Jerry!,144
15891,JERRY," I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment.  So, you want a protein shake, or something?",144
15892,GEORGE," Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. ",144
15893,JERRY,  Hello.. Newman.,144
15894,NEWMAN,"  I need that mail, where is it?!",144
15895,JERRY, What's the difference?,144
15896,NEWMAN, The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!,144
15897,JERRY," Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.",144
15898,NEWMAN, Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii!  I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever!  The dream is dead.,144
15899,JERRY, You're giving up that easy?,144
15900,NEWMAN, I usually do.  See ya.,144
15901,JERRY,"  No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!",144
15902,NEWMAN,  What are you proposing?,144
15903,JERRY,"  Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!",144
15904,NEWMAN, An alliance?,144
15905,JERRY,  An alliance.  Now get the hell outta here. ,144
15906,ELAINE, Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?,144
15907,JERRY,"  Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.",144
15908,ELAINE," Well, anyway, get this",144
15909,JERRY," ""Big head""  That's almost a compliment.",144
15910,ELAINE,  It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.,144
15911,JERRY, Hello?,144
15912,GEORGE,  Hey.,144
15913,JERRY," Hey, George.",144
15914,GEORGE," Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.",144
15915,JERRY, You can't make it?,144
15916,GEORGE," Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.",144
15917,JERRY, Alright. ,144
15918,ELAINE, Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?,144
15919,JERRY,  Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.,144
15920,ELAINE,"  Alright, well, I'll see ya. ",144
15921,JERRY," Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?",144
15922,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah.  I got some pilss. They taste terrible.",144
15923,JERRY,  Just swallow 'em.,144
15924,KRAMER,"  No, my throat's too tender.",144
15925,JERRY," Alright, sit down, sit down. ",144
15926,KRAMER, I don't want to!,144
15927,JERRY, C'mon. Just sit down!,144
15928,KRAMER,  Jerry! What?!,144
15929,JERRY, Sit down! Sit down!,144
15930,KRAMER,  Hey!,144
15931,JERRY, Lean your head back. Open your mouth!  Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!,144
15932,JERRY,"  What kind of pills are these, anyways?! ""For Smuckers""? ""May cause panting and loss of fur""?  These are dog pills!",144
15933,KRAMER, Whe have the same symptoms.,144
15934,JERRY," But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.",144
15935,KRAMER," No, no. No doctors.",144
15936,JERRY, Alright.. ,144
15937,KRAMER, Where are you going?,144
15938,JERRY, I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?,144
15939,KRAMER, I don't know..,144
15940,JERRY,"  C'mon, you wanna go for a ride?  Huh? C'mon! C'mon!",144
15941,DRIVER," Lady, could you move your head a little bit?",144
15942,ELAINE, What?,144
15943,DRIVER, Your head. I can't see out the back.  Little more..  ..Little more.  Thank you.,144
15944,KRAMER, I don't see any tissues back her..  Wait a minute!..  This isn't the way to the park!  Where are we going?.. I recognize this block!  You're taking me to the doctor!,144
15945,GEORGE," So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..",144
15946,ESTELLE, I feel a draft.  Let's change tables.,144
15947,FRANK, Get outta here! We have a booth.,144
15948,ESTELLE," Frank, I'm cold!",144
15949,FRANK, Order a hot dish.,144
15950,ESTELLE, Why can't we sit over there? ,144
15951,FRANK,  That's not a booth!,144
15952,ESTELLE,"  So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!",144
15953,FRANK,  I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that! ,144
15954,ESTELLE,"  Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!",144
15955,GEORGE,  Mom.. dad.,144
15956,FRANK," Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?",144
15957,GEORGE,"  Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.",144
15958,FRANK,  Where's that breeze coming from?,144
15959,JERRY," Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!",144
15960,KRAMER," No, Jerry!",144
15961,JERRY," Alright, that's it.. ",144
15962,KRAMER, No! Don't!,144
15963,JERRY," Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!",144
15964,ELDRIDGE," Just then, a rescue ship emerged from the fog and saved us. It was..  It was the sweetest sight my eyes ever saw.",144
15965,RICARDI,  Thank you Mr. Eldridge. The tenant board will now hear Mr. Costanza's testimony.,144
15966,JERRY," Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered?  What happened?",144
15967,NEWMAN, Kramer bit me!,144
15968,JERRY, Bit you?!,144
15969,NEWMAN," We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!",144
15970,JERRY,"  Well, what if I deliver it?",144
15971,NEWMAN, You?!  You can't deliver mail!,144
15972,JERRY," Well, why not?",144
15973,NEWMAN,  I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..,144
15974,JERRY, What am I gonna wear?,144
15975,NEWMAN, I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.,144
15976,JERRY,  I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!,144
15977,JERRY,  There you go. Merry Chirstmas!,144
15978,OWNER, Mail on Sunday?,144
15979,JERRY,  Oops. ,144
15980,GEORGE," I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear,  where I remained..  She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi..  The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage..  Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole..  In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man.  Thank you.  Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out.  Thanks again. ",144
15981,JERRY," Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, ""Photographs - Do not bend"".",144
15982,NEWMAN," ""Do not bend"".  Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine.  Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. ",144
15983,JERRY, What?,144
15984,NEWMAN, That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!,144
15985,JERRY, How did they know?!,144
15986,NEWMAN,  Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!,144
15987,JERRY,  I tried my best!,144
15988,NEWMAN, Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. ,144
15989,JERRY," You know, this is your coat.",144
15990,NEWMAN,  Damn!,144
15991,ELAINE,  Really?,144
15992,GEORGE," It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.",144
15993,JERRY," Boy, he didn't know what he was up against.  So, when do you move into the apartment?",144
15994,GEORGE, They're making their decision today.,144
15995,JERRY, What's the matter with you?,144
15996,ELAINE, Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. ,144
15997,JERRY, What giant freak-head?,144
15998,ELAINE,  The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!,144
15999,JERRY," So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!",144
16000,ELAINE,"  What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.",144
16001,JERRY,  Either way.,144
16002,ELAINE,  Alright.,144
16003,ALAN, I want to apologize for..,144
16004,ELAINE,"  Oh, please.",144
16005,ALAN, So you have a big head.,144
16006,ELAINE,  So what?,144
16007,ALAN, It goes well with that bump in your nose.,144
16008,ELAINE,  What?!,144
16009,WOMAN," Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police ""The Old Mill Restaurant"". Hurry!",144
16010,COP," Boy, that's some cough you got there.",144
16011,GEORGE," Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?",144
16012,ALAN, I'm moving in. Alan Mercer. New neighbor. ,144
16013,GEORGE, What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!,144
16014,ALAN, Yeah.,144
16015,GEORGE," Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. ",144
16016,ALAN," Oh, fork in the forehead.",144
16017,GEORGE, That's why they gave you the apartment?,144
16018,ALAN," No, I just gave the super 50 bucks.",144
16019,GEORGE," Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!",144
16020,ALAN," Tough luck, chinless. ",144
16021,JERRY," So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.",145
16022,ELAINE," I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?",145
16023,JERRY, Five minutes.,145
16024,ELAINE, Five minutes? That's it?,145
16025,JERRY, What's the difference? You never showed up.,145
16026,ELAINE," I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.",145
16027,JERRY," Well, we barely knew the guy.",145
16028,ELAINE," So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.",145
16029,JERRY, That's the way it works.,145
16030,ELAINE, When did you tell George to be here?,145
16031,JERRY, I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?,145
16032,ELAINE, About five.,145
16033,JERRY, That's enough. ,145
16034,GEORGE , Early! Alright!  Cold.,145
16035,KRAMER," So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.",145
16036,JERRY, How did you know about that?,145
16037,KRAMER," Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.",145
16038,JERRY, He can't do that.,145
16039,KRAMER ," It's the only way you'll learn.  Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.",145
16040,GEORGE, Fantastic day! Fantastic!,145
16041,JERRY, What happened?,145
16042,GEORGE,"  Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.",145
16043,JERRY, Fantastic.,145
16044,GEORGE," Then, I'm at The Foundation...",145
16045,JERRY, You're still doing that?,145
16046,GEORGE," Sometimes, once in a while.",145
16047,JERRY, When you feel guilty.,145
16048,GEORGE," No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.",145
16049,KRAMER, That's caged heat.,145
16050,GEORGE, Yeah-hah!,145
16051,JERRY, What are you gonna do there?,145
16052,GEORGE," Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight.  Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?",145
16053,JERRY," Yes, I know, I know.",145
16054,GEORGE," I noticed you eh, chose the eh ""clowns with balloons"" check design.",145
16055,JERRY," It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.",145
16056,ELAINE," Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.",145
16057,KRAMER," Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs.",145
16058,KURT," Uh, no - I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh.",145
16059,KRAMER, Yes! These are sweatshop eggs.,145
16060,KURT ," Ah, I gotta call the office. Honey, will you order for me?",145
16061,ELAINE ," I'm a ""honey."" He's pretty great, huh?",145
16062,JERRY, Is he from the future?,145
16063,ELAINE," No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.",145
16064,GEORGE," Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts.  This is guts.",145
16065,ELAINE, What? Clinging to some scraps?,145
16066,GEORGE," These are not ""scraps."" These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair.",145
16067,ELAINE," Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!",145
16068,JERRY," Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.",145
16069,MARCELINO, People seem to like the clowns.,145
16070,JERRY ," Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.",145
16071,MARCELINO, 'Kay.,145
16072,JERRY , Aren't you going to take the check down?,145
16073,MARCELINO," Sorry, no. It's store policy.",145
16074,JERRY, But it's your bodega.,145
16075,MARCELINO, Even I am not above the policy.,145
16076,BETSY, Those are our tennis courts.,145
16077,GEORGE, Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?,145
16078,BETSY," There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza. This is a minimum security facility.",145
16079,GEORGE," Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in ""the box""?",145
16080,BETSY, No.,145
16081,GEORGE , This prison stinks.,145
16082,BETSY," And finally, the library, which has just been refurbished thanks to your generous donation. This is Celia Morgan, our librarian.",145
16083,CELIA, Nice to meet you.,145
16084,BETSY, I'll be in my office if you need me.,145
16085,GEORGE," Thanks, Warden.",145
16086,BETSY , Betsy.,145
16087,GEORGE , Betsy.,145
16088,CELIA," So, are you the head of the foundation?",145
16089,GEORGE," Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me.  So you two uh, shop at the same store, ?",145
16090,CELIA," No, it's standard issue.",145
16091,GEORGE, Oh my God...You're in jail?  That is so cool!,145
16092,JERRY, You asked her out?,145
16093,GEORGE," Well...not ""out."" She's a prisoner.",145
16094,JERRY, How could you ask her out?,145
16095,GEORGE, Why not?,145
16096,JERRY, I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!,145
16097,GEORGE, That was different!,145
16098,JERRY, I'll say.,145
16099,GEORGE," Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?",145
16100,JERRY , The pop-in.,145
16101,GEORGE," Yeah, no pop-in, no ""in the neighborhood,"" no ""I saw your light was on."" And the best part is, if things go really well...",145
16102,JERRY, Conjugal visit?,145
16103,GEORGE , Don't jinx it! Don't jinx ,145
16104,KRAMER, Hey.,145

16107,JERRY, George is dating a convict.,145
16108,KRAMER, Oh? What's she in for? ,145
16109,GEORGE, Embezzlement.,145
16110,KRAMER ," Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full.",145
16111,JERRY," Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?",145
16112,KRAMER," Well, not here.",145
16113,KRAMER, Okay ,145
16114,JERRY," Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?",145
16115,KRAMER," Well, it's chicken feed. ",145
16116,JERRY, I sense something is afoot.,145
16117,KRAMER," Yeah, I bought a chicken.",145
16118,GEORGE, Allow me. Why?,145
16119,KRAMER," Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.",145
16120,JERRY," Allow me. What are you, an idiot?",145
16121,KRAMER, No ,145
16122,KURT," Hold it, hold it, hold it, here, I got it. Catch. ",145
16123,ELAINE," Hm.  Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God.",145
16124,KURT, What?,145
16125,ELAINE," Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.",145
16126,KURT," Well, it still is. I shave my head for my swim team. I just liked the way it looked, so I kept it.",145
16127,ELAINE, Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? ,145
16128,JERRY,  Oh what...,145
16129,KRAMER, Hey.,145
16130,JERRY," Is that your ""chicken"" making all that noise?",145
16131,KRAMER," Oh, Jerry loves the morning.",145
16132,JERRY, Who?,145
16133,KRAMER, Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.,145
16134,JERRY," Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken.",145
16135,KRAMER, Of course it is. I picked it out myself.,145
16136,JERRY," Well, you picked out a rooster.",145
16137,KRAMER," Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.",145
16138,CELIA, This was fun.,145
16139,GEORGE, Yeah. I had a great time.,145
16140,GUARD," Five minutes, Mr. Costanza.",145
16141,GEORGE, The whole hour just flew by.  ,145
16142,GUARD, I'll get that.,145

16149,JERRY, I'm not having money problems.,145
16150,HELEN," Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.",145
16151,MORTY, He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!,145
16152,JERRY, I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!,145
16153,HELEN, That's it. I'm gonna to send you fifty dollars.,145
16154,JERRY, You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!,145
16155,HELEN," We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope.",145
16156,JERRY ," I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!",145
16157,MORTY, I don't see envelopes!,145
16158,HELEN," They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes...  Show you...",145
16159,JERRY," Ma! Ma! MAAA!  Oh, ahhhh ",145

16165,JERRY, Having her in jail.,145
16166,GEORGE, The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.,145
16167,JERRY," Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.",145
16168,ELAINE, Here.  Take a look at that.,145
16169,JERRY, Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.,145
16170,ELAINE, No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.,145
16171,JERRY, So he just shaves his head for no reason?,145
16172,GEORGE, That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!,145
16173,ELAINE, And he's growing it in just for me.  It's mine. It's all mine. ,145
16174,JERRY, It's just hair.,145
16175,ELAINE, It's not just hair! Look!,145
16176,JERRY, It's brown.,145
16177,ELAINE, It's chestnut with auburn highlights!,145
16178,JERRY, So?,145
16179,ELAINE, You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.,145
16180,ELAINE," I'm sorry, George, but it's true.",145
16181,GEORGE , I knew it.,145
16182,MARCELINO," Hey, Kramer.",145

16188,MARCELINO, Little Jerry Seinfeld. Does he bounce checks? ,145
16189,KRAMER," Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?",145
16190,MARCELINO," Sorry Kramer, can't help you.",145
16191,KRAMER," Hey, hey Jerry, come on. Sorry.",145
16192,MARCELINO , I like the way he handles himself.,145
16193,KRAMER, Oh yeah ,145
16194,ELAINE," Ohhh, it's coming in already!",145
16195,KURT, Yeah ,145
16196,ELAINE," Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...",145
16197,KURT, What?,145
16198,ELAINE," Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.",145
16199,KURT, What do you mean? ,145
16200,ELAINE," Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?",145
16201,KURT , About three years.,145
16202,ELAINE, Huh.,145

16205,GEORGE," Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.",145
16206,CELIA, Good news - I'm up for parole.,145
16207,GEORGE, Parole!  That's dynamite!,145
16208,JERRY, So Marcelino's going to take down the check?,145
16209,KRAMER," Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.",145
16210,JERRY, Great!  What?,145
16211,KRAMER," Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.",145
16212,JERRY, Ah ha...,145
16213,KRAMER," Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.",145
16214,JERRY," Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.",145
16215,KRAMER, Only in The United States.,145
16216,JERRY, It's inhumane!,145
16217,KRAMER," No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.",145
16218,JERRY, It's two roosters peckin' at each other!,145
16219,KRAMER, What?,145
16220,JERRY, Yeah!,145
16221,KRAMER," Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like ""American Gladiators.""",145
16222,JERRY," No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt.",145
16223,KRAMER," Yeah, well, I left him with Marcelino!",145
16224,KRAMER, My Little Jerry! ,145
16225,JERRY," Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?",145
16226,KRAMER," Oh well, he's more than O.K., he won!",145
16227,JERRY, You let him fight?,145
16228,KRAMER," Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.",145
16229,JERRY, How long do they usually last?,145
16230,KRAMER, Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.,145
16231,JERRY, Great!,145
16232,KRAMER, Hey.,145
16233,GEORGE, Celia's up for parole.,145
16234,KRAMER," Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.",145
16235,GEORGE, What?,145
16236,KRAMER, Who?,145
16237,JERRY, I'm too tired.,145
16238,KRAMER ," O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.",145
16239,JERRY, O.K. ,145
16240,GEORGE ," It's over, Jerry. She's gettin' out.",145
16241,JERRY," Ah, I'm so sorry.",145
16242,GEORGE, She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies.  Talking...,145
16243,JERRY," In other words, a normal relationship.",145
16244,GEORGE," Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.",145
16245,JERRY," Well, she'll still be an ex-con.",145
16246,GEORGE, It's not the same.,145
16247,JERRY," Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.",145
16248,ELAINE, Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?,145
16249,KURT, I don't care.,145
16250,ELAINE," You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.",145
16251,KURT, Oh yeah...meatball...fell out of my sandwich.,145
16252,ELAINE, You already ate?,145
16253,KURT, It's from yesterday.,145
16254,MARCELINO, Jerry! You missed a hell of a cockfight last night.,145
16255,JERRY, Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!,145
16256,MARCELINO, Now we have a new deal.,145
16257,JERRY, New deal?,145
16258,MARCELINO," When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine, the check will be yours.",145
16259,JERRY, This is Outrageous!  Pack of Juicy Fruit.,145
16260,MARCELINO , 85 cents.,145
16261,JERRY, 85 cents? That is Outrageous!,145
16262,JERRY," Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.",145
16263,KRAMER," Well, that's out of the question.",145
16264,JERRY," But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.",145
16265,KRAMER," Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!",145
16266,JERRY," No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!",145
16267,KRAMER," You know, I think you're jealous.",145
16268,JERRY, Of what?,145
16269,KRAMER ," Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!",145
16270,JERRY," Kramer, give me that rooster!",145
16271,KRAMER, Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! ,145
16272,BETSY," George, Celia has listed you as a character reference. Whatever you can tell us would certainly be helpful in, her getting paroled.",145
16273,GEORGE," Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.",145
16274,BETSY, Does she have any plans after she's released?,145
16275,GEORGE," Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - ""the gang,"" as she likes to call them , you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that.",145
16276,MARCELINO, Jerry! Tomorrow night's fight-night. Where's my rooster?,145
16277,JERRY, Kramer won't sell.,145
16278,MARCELINO," Well, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take down your check anyway.",145
16279,JERRY," Oh well, thank you, Marcelino.",145
16280,MARCELINO," Well, perhaps someday you will do me a favor. And that day is today. Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down in the third round of tomorrow's main event.",145
16281,JERRY, You want Little Jerry to take a dive?,145
16282,MARCELINO," Shhh, not so loud.",145
16283,JERRY," First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.",145
16284,MARCELINO," Can, too!",145
16285,JERRY," Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.",145
16286,MARCELINO ," Big Jerry is making a big mistake, Jerry.",145

16291,KURT," Oh, God.",145
16292,GEORGE," No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.",145
16293,KURT, Happy? Why should I be happy?,145
16294,GEORGE, You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter -  - then you won't be Kurt anymore.,145
16295,KURT, Who will I be?,145
16296,KURT, How long do I have?,145

16307,KRAMER, I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.,145
16308,JERRY," Hey, Kramer...?",145

16312,GEORGE, Is that good?,145
16313,JERRY, I don't know. Where have you been?,145
16314,GEORGE," Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!",145
16315,JERRY, Oh my God! “The break-out/pop-in!”,145
16316,GEORGE," Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -",145
16317,JERRY ," George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. ",145
16318,ELAINE," Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some ""fiance-time,"" I need some ""make-my-girlfriends-jealous"" time...",145

16323,KURT," No, no, no...it has to be now.",145
16324,ELAINE,  Could I see the ring again?,145
16325,JERRY ," So, you're actually considering it?",145
16326,ELAINE," Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.",145
16327,JERRY," Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.",145
16328,ELAINE," Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?",145
16329,GEORGE," Oh, hey, sorry I'm late.",145

16334,JERRY, hmm. ,145
16335,JERRY," Hey, how's he doin'?",145

16337,JERRY , Fifty dollars. I Don't Believe This!,145
16338,KRAMER, There's Marcelino. ,145
16339,JERRY, Look at the size of his bird!,145
16340,KRAMER, That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.,145
16341,KURT," Hi, is George back from the cockfight yet? You know, I gotta thank him, he changed my life.",145
16342,CELIA," No, it must have been a good fight, he's not back yet.",145
16343,KURT," Ah, damn.",145
16344,CELIA," Aw, man!",145
16345,KURT , I'm not George Costanza.,145
16346,ELAINE ," Muchos gracias.  O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!",145
16347,JERRY, He's a ringer!,145
16348,GEORGE, Where's the tamale guy?,145

16355,ELAINE, Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!,145
16356,KURT," They thought I was George. I'm not that bald. And I have too little time left to take that kind of crap, so I, slugged him.",145
16357,ELAINE," So, how long are you gonna be in here for?",145
16358,KURT," Well, my lawyer says 14 months, but with good behavior, maybe...10?",145
16359,ELAINE,  So 10 to 14 months.,145
16360,KURT, Yeah.,145
16361,KRAMER," Well, that was alright, huh?",146

16368,MORTY," Helen, did you pack my travel gym?",146
16369,HELEN," Yes.  Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four.",146
16370,MORTY," Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob.",146
16371,JERRY," Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.",146
16372,HELEN," Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.",146
16373,JERRY, Am I finally getting a baby brother?,146
16374,HELEN," Jerry, be serious.",146
16375,MORTY, How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?,146
16376,JERRY, What? The Cadillac I bought for you?,146
16377,MORTY," It's too much car, Jerry.",146
16378,JERRY," Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?",146
16379,MORTY, I don't think we even use it.,146
16380,JERRY," Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.",146
16381,HELEN, We already sold it.,146
16382,JERRY, Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?,146
16383,MORTY," Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.",146
16384,HELEN," Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.",146
16385,JERRY,  Ugh.,146

16397,MORTY,  And we want you to have the money.,146
16398,JERRY,  I don't need the money.,146
16399,MORTY, What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.,146
16400,JERRY,"  Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!",146
16401,HELEN," Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel.  It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all.",146
16402,KRAMER," Yeah, that def jam is a force.",146
16403,HELEN," Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program.",146
16404,JERRY,  Oh my god.,146
16405,KRAMER," Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave.",146
16406,GEORGE," Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.",146
16407,ELAINE," So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?",146

16421,GEORGE, You see what just happened here?,146
16422,JERRY, What?,146
16423,GEORGE, She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.,146
16424,JERRY, And you misinterpret this how?,146
16425,GEORGE, She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.,146
16426,JERRY," I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.",146
16427,GEORGE," No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.",146

16433,JERRY, I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.,146
16434,GEORGE, Your parents'll never let you do it.,146
16435,JERRY, They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.,146
16436,GEORGE, What kind of money you think your parents have?,146
16437,JERRY, Excuse me?,146
16438,GEORGE, I bet they have more money than mine.,146
16439,JERRY," Come on, your parents have money.",146

16450,JERRY, Course you may not see it for twenty years.,146
16451,GEORGE, Twenty years? That long?,146
16452,JERRY, Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?,146
16453,GEORGE," Fortunately, yes.",146

16470,KRAMER," Well, I'd say it nicely.",146
16471,ELAINE, I don't think so.,146

16492,GEORGE, I guess you two are the lucky ones.,146
16493,FRANK, So far.,146

16532,GEORGE," Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine,  thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java.",146

16564,ELAINE," Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.",146

16577,MORTY, Who's Mr Fancy?,146
16578,KRAMER,"  I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.",146
16579,EMILY," Aww, that's sweet, but actually I, I think I'd prefer it if you left.",146
16580,KRAMER,  What?,146
16581,EMILY, You were completely right. I sleep so much better when I'm alone.  And you scream in your sleep.,146
16582,KRAMER, I do?,146
16583,KRAMER,"  There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.",146
16584,EMILY," C'mon, it was probably the wind.",146
16585,KRAMER," No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar.  Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth.  'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.",146
16586,EMILY,"  Well, I do.",146
16587,JACK, What took you so long?,146
16588,JERRY, I live in New York.  What the hell happened?,146
16589,JACK," This thing is a, is a behemoth.",146
16590,JERRY, What did you do?,146
16591,JACK," I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker and it took off on me. And the next thing you know, I was submerged. I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me.",146
16592,JERRY,"  You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.",146
16593,JACK,  Do whatever you want. It's your car.,146
16594,JERRY, My car? You drove it into the swamp!,146
16595,JACK," It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too.",146
16596,JERRY,"  You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.",146
16597,GEORGE,  Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?,146
16598,FRANK, That's your mother's new car.,146
16599,GEORGE, You bought that?,146
16600,FRANK, It's a Coupe de Elegance.,146
16601,ESTELLE," Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.",146
16602,KRAMER, Mornin'.,146
16603,KRAMER," Oh, boy.",146
16604,GEORGE, What the hell is going on here?,146
16605,KRAMER," I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.",146
16606,ESTELLE," George, your mother and I, and Kramer  have been talking.",146
16607,GEORGE,  Oh god.,146
16608,KRAMER," Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.",146
16609,FRANK,"  You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that.",146
16610,GEORGE, Wait a minute.  You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!,146
16611,ESTELLE," Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?",146
16612,PETERMAN," So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her old position, at her original salary...",146
16613,PETERMAN," ...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a job... done.",146
16614,ELAINE,  What about my stock options?,146
16615,PETERMAN, I think not.,146
16616,PETERMAN," Now, down to business.  I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf.",146
16617,ELAINE," Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.",146
16618,MORTY,"  A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.",146
16619,ELAINE,"  It's, ah, Asian-Americans.",146
16620,MORTY, What?,146
16621,PETERMAN,  Who are you?,146
16622,ELAINE," Don't worry, I...",146
16623,MORTY, Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.,146
16624,ELAINE," Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...",146
16625,PETERMAN," Elaine, did you hire this man?",146
16626,ELAINE,"  No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.",146
16627,ELAINE," So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.",146
16628,GEORGE,  But happy.,146
16629,ELAINE," Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...",146
16630,GEORGE, Obviously.,146
16631,ELAINE," Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.",146
16632,GEORGE," No, no. No, no, no.  We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.",146
16633,ELAINE," Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go.",146
16634,GEORGE," What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.",146
16635,ELAINE," Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...",146
16636,GEORGE,"  Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.",146
16637,ELAINE," Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.",146
16638,GEORGE," You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?",146
16639,ELAINE, What?,146
16640,GEORGE, You schedule a late meeting.,146
16641,ELAINE,  Huh? What does that do?,146
16642,GEORGE," These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped.  How did we get back onto you?!",146
16643,ELAINE,  I gotta split.,146
16644,GEORGE,"  You know, I got nothing outta this!",146
16645,KRAMER," Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.",146
16646,FRANK, That's right. That's me on the left.,146
16647,KRAMER," So, you sleep in separate beds.",146
16648,FRANK," Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I could get some rest.",146
16649,KRAMER,  Really?,146
16650,FRANK,  Estelle's got the  jimmy arms.,146
16651,KRAMER, You can get that in your arms?,146
16652,FRANK, Like you wouldn't believe.,146
16653,JACK," Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here?",146
16654,JERRY," Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...",146
16655,JACK," You are uh, thinking of staying here?",146
16656,JERRY, Well...,146
16657,JACK,"  You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!",146
16658,JERRY, You didn't like that crack about the pen.,146
16659,JACK, I did not.,146
16660,GEORGE," Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...",146
16661,GEORGE,"  As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much.  So, I've decided, I want you to stay.",146
16662,FRANK, It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving tonight.,146
16663,GEORGE,  But you said it was my call.,146
16664,ESTELLE, We were just being nice.,146
16665,ESTELLE,"  Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?",146
16666,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.",146
16667,GEORGE,  You're letting him have a woman over?!,146
16668,FRANK," He's not family. It's different, psychologically.",146
16669,PETERMAN," And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks.",146
16670,MORTY," Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...",146
16671,ELAINE," Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.",146
16672,PETERMAN,"  Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.",146
16673,MORTY," Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here?",146
16674,PETERMAN,"  It's only five fifteen. So, later on that same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey...",146
16675,MORTY,"  Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story.",146
16676,PETERMAN, Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.,146
16677,MORTY," Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.",146
16678,PETERMAN,"  Morty, you're out.",146
16679,MORTY,"  Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.",146
16680,KRAMER, I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.,146
16681,EMILY,  No-one held a gun to your head.,146
16682,KRAMER,  Yeah.,146
16683,EMILY,"  Don't forget, we're eating dinner at the Feinerman's tomorrow night.",146
16684,KRAMER,"  Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.",146
16685,EMILY, You like 'em.,146
16686,KRAMER, I've had it with 'em.,146
16687,EMILY, Then we won't go.,146
16688,KRAMER,"  Okay, okay. What time?",146
16689,EMILY, Eight thirty.,146
16690,KRAMER,  Ahh. That was alright.,146
16691,ELAINE," 'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'",146
16692,JERRY," Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...",146
16693,ELAINE,  Yeah.,146
16694,GEORGE,  That's a shame.,146
16695,ELAINE,"  What, are you sticking it to me?",146
16696,GEORGE,  What?,146
16697,ELAINE, I think you're sticking it to me.,146
16698,JERRY," Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.",146
16699,ELAINE,  Stickin' it!,146
16700,JERRY, You're not alone. I'm practically broke.,146
16701,ELAINE, Really?,146
16702,JERRY," No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.",146
16703,GEORGE,  Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious.,146
16704,JERRY," Well, you seem happy.",146
16705,GEORGE, I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away.  I'm basking in the buffer zone.  'Nother piece of pie here!,146
16706,ELAINE," So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?",146
16707,JERRY," Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet.",146
16708,ELAINE, Hmm.,146
16709,MORTY, When are we gonna tell Jerry?,146
16710,HELEN, I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.,146
16711,MORTY, He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.,146
16712,HELEN," Besides, that condo was too much house.",146
16713,ESTELLE, How many times can you check the car?,146
16714,FRANK,  I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day.,146
16715,ESTELLE, Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?,146
16716,FRANK, They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there!,146
16717,ESTELLE,  You're driving me crazy!,146
16718,FRANK,"  That's it, we're going back to Queens.  Where's my hat?",146
16719,ESTELLE,  Nooh!,146
16720,BILL," Well, if the big man wants a new scoreboard, I don't wanna be the one to tell him no.",147
16721,REILLY, No-one in the park is gonna be able to see it from there.,147
16722,GEORGE,"  Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?",147
16723,REILLY," Hey George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.",147
16724,GEORGE,  The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp!  Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said!  Dammit!,147
16725,JERRY," 'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?",147
16726,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'",147
16727,JERRY,  Really? That's great. You said that to him?,147
16728,GEORGE,"  Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.",147
16729,JERRY, Oh. That's not quite the same.,147
16730,GEORGE, No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.,147
16731,JERRY, I'm gonna grab a can of balls.,147
16732,GEORGE, Right.,147
16733,MILOS, Hello. My name is Milos. How can I help you.,147
16734,JERRY, I need a can of balls.,147
16735,MILOS," Can of balls for the nice guy, alri...",147
16736,MILOS," ...Ahh. You don't plan to hit these balls with that racquet, do you?",147
16737,KRAMER," Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes?",147
16738,ELAINE," Oh.  Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah.  This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.",147
16739,KRAMER," Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.",147
16740,ELAINE," Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream.",147
16741,KRAMER,"  I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.",147
16742,ELAINE,"  'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.",147
16743,KRAMER," Yeah, went straight to video.",147
16744,KRAMER,  That makes me the premiere.,147
16745,ELAINE,  Hah.,147
16746,KRAMER," Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?",147
16747,JERRY, No.,147
16748,KRAMER," It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.",147
16749,JERRY,"  'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'",147
16750,KRAMER," Can you do that for me, buddy?",147
16751,JERRY," Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.",147
16752,KRAMER," Well, I'm gonna type it up.",147
16753,JERRY," Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.",147
16754,KRAMER," Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me.  I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.",147
16755,KRAMER," Oh, hey, new racquet, huh?",147
16756,JERRY," Yeah.  I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.",147
16757,JERRY," In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.",147
16758,KRAMER,"  Well, you're not gonna need this any more.",147
16759,JERRY,"  Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.",147
16760,KRAMER,"  Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page.",147
16761,ELAINE,"  Oh. Oh, bravo, Vincent. Bravo. ",147
16762,ELAINE, What?,147
16763,VINCENT , Did you enjoy the movie?,147
16764,ELAINE, Who is it?,147
16765,VINCENT , It's Vincent.,147
16766,ELAINE, Of Vincent's picks?,147
16767,VINCENT , The same.,147
16768,JERRY, He called you?,147
16769,ELAINE," He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.",147
16770,JERRY, To a guy you've never met?  Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.,147
16771,ELAINE, Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.,147
16772,PLAYER ," Little help, hey!",147
16773,ELAINE,  Yeah.,147
16774,PLAYER, Thank you.,147
16775,ELAINE,"  Oh god, that guy's terrible.",147
16776,JERRY,  Mmm-hmm.,147
16777,ELAINE," Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?",147
16778,JERRY, George used up all my guest passes already.,147
16779,ELAINE, Ah.,147
16780,PLAYER, Ahh.,147
16781,JERRY, Come on.,147
16782,PLAYER, Thank you.,147
16783,JERRY,  Here you go.,147
16784,JERRY,  Milos?,147
16785,MILOS,"  Oh, hey.  How you doing?",147
16786,MILOS," Okay, we should uh, wrap it up here.",147
16787,ELAINE, So he was bad. What d'you care?,147
16788,JERRY," Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.",147
16789,KRAMER," Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.",147
16790,ELAINE, The executor? Of what?,147
16791,JERRY, Kramer wants to die with dignity.,147
16792,ELAINE, There's a feather in your cap.,147
16793,KRAMER," I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. ",147
16794,GEORGE," Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.",147
16795,JERRY, D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?,147
16796,GEORGE," I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.",147
16797,ELAINE, Who's Reilly?,147
16798,JERRY," George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'",147
16799,GEORGE, Listen to the comeback.  'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.',147
16800,GEORGE,  Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!,147
16801,ELAINE," How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?",147
16802,GEORGE,  What does that mean?,147
16803,JERRY,"  Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'",147
16804,GEORGE,"  No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.",147
16805,KRAMER," Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.",147
16806,GEORGE,  I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.,147
16807,KRAMER," Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...",147
16808,GEORGE,"  Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!",147
16809,KRAMER,  Did you take this out of the garbage?,147
16810,JERRY," Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.",147
16811,KRAMER," Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk.  How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?",147
16812,KRAMER,  You see? You can't let go.,147
16813,JERRY," Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.",147
16814,KRAMER," I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?",147
16815,ELAINE, Me?,147
16816,KRAMER," Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.",147
16817,ELAINE,"  Oh, ho, c'mon.",147
16818,SHELLBACH," Situation number four. You're breathing on your own, you're conscious, but with no muscular function.",147
16819,KRAMER," Well, would I be able to communicate?",147
16820,SHELLBACH, I don't see how.,147
16821,ELAINE," Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.",147
16822,KRAMER," Huhh, yeah, let's pull the cord.",147
16823,ELAINE, Yank it like  you're starting a mower.,147
16824,SHELLBACH," Moving on. You have liver, kidneys and gall bladder, but no central nervous system.",147
16825,KRAMER," Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.",147
16826,SHELLBACH," Okay. One lung, blind and you're eating through a tube.",147
16827,KRAMER," Naw, that's not my style.",147
16828,ELAINE, Bore-ing.,147
16829,SHELLBACH," Alright, you can eat. But machines do everything else.",147
16830,KRAMER,  Uhm...,147
16831,ELAINE, I'd stick.,147
16832,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. Stick.  'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.",147
16833,ELAINE,  That's right.,147
16834,JERRY, Hello Milos.,147
16835,MILOS," Jerry, thank god you got my message. Thank you so much for coming down here. Uhm, listen...",147
16836,JERRY,"  You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.",147
16837,MILOS, I..I...,147
16838,JERRY, You can't even play.,147
16839,MILOS," Believe me, it is Milos great shame. But Jerry, I could lose my business if anybody find out. How would you like extra year membership of the club? Free. No charge.",147
16840,JERRY, You could do that?,147
16841,MILOS," Jerry, for you, anything.",147
16842,JERRY,"  Game, set and match, huh Milos?",147
16843,MILOS,"  Hah, Jerry, I am so sorry. they tell me there is no way they can do it.  Is there anything else I can do for you? Anything at all. I refund your money.",147
16844,JERRY,"  You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...",147
16845,MILOS, Shhh-shhh.  I make it up to you.,147
16846,JERRY,"  Yeah, you'll make it up to me.",147
16847,JERRY," Tennis, anyone?",147
16848,ELAINE," Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning.  'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?",147
16849,KRAMER," That's a lotta yearning, huh?",147
16850,ELAINE," You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.",147
16851,KRAMER," Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.",147
16852,ELAINE, Really?,147
16853,KRAMER,"  See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh?  Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise.",147
16854,ELAINE,  Huh.  Well...,147

16867,VINCENT ,  The Gene pick. How could you? I thought we had something special.,147
16868,ELAINE,"  No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.",147
16869,ELAINE, Vincent?,147
16870,FRED," Alright, let's get to it.",147
16871,GEORGE," Wha..wait a minute, wha..what about Reilly?",147

16878,JERRY,"  Hoh, that Milos.  Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?",147

16882,NURSE ," Doctor, how's her coma?",147

16884,DOCTOR ," Wait a minute, she's coming out of the coma.",147
16885,DOCTOR ," Mrs Allbright, can you hear me? Are you okay?",147
16886,ALLBRIGHT ,  I feel so rested and refreshed. Get me a toothbrush.,147

16893,PATTY,  Milos. My husband!,147
16894,JERRY,  Your husband?!,147
16895,GEORGE," So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?",147
16896,JERRY,  He's new around here.,147
16897,GEORGE,"  So, details?",147
16898,JERRY,"  Well, I didn't sleep with her.",147
16899,GEORGE," Because of society, right?",147
16900,JERRY,"  Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?",147
16901,GEORGE, Reilly is no longer with the club.  You believe that?,147
16902,JERRY," Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.",147
16903,GEORGE," Yeah, I'm gonna let it go.",147
16904,JERRY," You never really had the right comeback, anyway.",147
16905,GEORGE,"  Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say.",147
16906,KRAMER," Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end.",147
16907,GEORGE,"  Ohh, I wanted to see that.  Thanks. Thanks a lot.",147
16908,KRAMER, I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.,147
16909,JERRY, I didn't know it was possible not to know that.,147

16916,ELAINE," Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?",147
16917,MANAGER, Excuse me.,147
16918,ELAINE, What're you doing?,147

16924,MANAGER, I'm Gene.,147
16925,ELAINE,  Hi.,147
16926,JERRY," Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.",147
16927,MILOS,"  Thank you, but, unfortunately, I have much larger problems to fry. My wife, she has no respect for Milos anymore.",147
16928,JERRY, I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.,147
16929,MILOS," Patty, she, she loves tennis, as much like I do.  Wou..would you, wi..will you let me beat you in tennis? That is the only way I can show her I am still a man.",147
16930,JERRY,"  Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.",147
16931,JERRY, So you hurt Vincent's feelings?,147

16936,GEORGE,"  So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.",147
16937,ELAINE, Ohio?,147
16938,GEORGE, Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.,147
16939,JERRY,"  You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?",147
16940,GEORGE," Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.",147
16941,ELAINE," See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.",147
16942,GEORGE,"  It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it.  And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!",147
16943,GEORGE,  Not you.,147
16944,OLD WOMAN ," Oh, brittle bones. How I long to be rid of the pain.",147

16949,ELAINE," Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive.  Now, let's have a look at you.",147
16950,VINCENT ,"  Alright, but, can you bring me few things from the store? I haven't been out in a while.",147

16967,VINCENT, No. Go away. Now.,147
16968,ELAINE,"  No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out.  I just, I know you feel what I feel.",147
16969,WOMAN, Excuse me. Can I help you?,147
16970,VINCENT," Aw, dammit!",147

17005,GEORGE,"  Huh haha!  You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself!  Ha ha!",147
17006,ELLEN," So, they have this clock now, where you punch in your age, and all your risk factors. It actually counts down how much time you have left to live.",148
17007,JERRY," So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!",148

17033,GEORGE," Quick, what's your favorite animal?",148
17034,GEORGE,  A frog?,148
17035,GEORGE,  Frog is wrong.,148
17036,GEORGE,"  I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.",148
17037,GEORGE,"  Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.",148
17038,GEORGE,  I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.,148

17046,STEVEN, I've been telling people that I'd like to be an architect..,148
17047,ELAINE," So, get this",148
17048,JERRY," Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.",148

17050,JERRY, Hey.,148
17051,ELAINE, Hey!,148
17052,KRAMER," Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic,  and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye.  So I give hime the crook-eye back,  you know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!",148
17053,JERRY, The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?,148
17054,KRAMER," Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know,  they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom.  I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.",148
17055,ELAINE, What? What happened?,148
17056,KRAMER, Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this  I'm only showing eight fingers.,148
17057,JERRY," Well, what does that mean?",148
17058,KRAMER," That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President..  They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!",148

17068,ELLEN," Yeah, no one called.",148
17069,JERRY, They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.,148
17070,GEORGE," So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. ",148
17071,JERRY, There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.,148
17072,GEORGE, Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?,148
17073,JERRY," No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!",148
17074,GEORGE,"  Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.",148
17075,JERRY, Yeah?,148
17076,GEORGE," I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..",148
17077,JERRY, Is he smart?,148
17078,GEORGE,  He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this,148
17079,JERRY, Hey! Just like you pretend to be.,148
17080,GEORGE," Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.",148
17081,JERRY, I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!,148
17082,ELAINE," Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. ",148
17083,PETERMAN, Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. ,148
17084,ELAINE," Well,  what part of your life  do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?",148
17085,PETERMAN," Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life.",148
17086,ELAINE, Oh.,148
17087,PETERMAN,  Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them.,148
17088,ELAINE," Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..",148
17089,PETERMAN,  2.. CBS..,148
17090,ELAINE," get, um, started..",148
17091,PETERMAN, 3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel?,148
17092,ELAINE,"  Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.",148
17093,PETERMAN," well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?",148
17094,ELAINE," You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?",148
17095,PETERMAN,  You don't say.,148
17096,ELAINE, Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.,148
17097,PETERMAN," Well, that's pretty exciting.  Let's put that in the book.",148
17098,ELAINE," But, that didn't happen to you.",148
17099,PETERMAN," So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman.",148
17100,ELAINE," No, I - I really don't think you can do that.",148
17101,PETERMAN,"  Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. ",148
17102,ELAINE, You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.,148
17103,JERRY, Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?,148
17104,ELLEN," No, this is brand new. Do you like it?",148
17105,JERRY," Actually, yeah.  Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?!  Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!",148
17106,ELLEN,"  No, Jerry, the waitress game be another one.",148
17107,JERRY, I guess that's all right.,148
17108,ELLEN," Is something wrong, Jerry?",148
17109,JERRY," No, absolutely nothing.  You're fantastic!  Hey guys!",148
17110,GEORGE, Hey.,148
17111,JERRY,"  Kramer, George, this is Ellen.",148
17112,GEORGE," Ladies and gentlemen, this  is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind.",148
17113,WYCK," George, the quailifications for this scholarship were suppose to be.. largely academic.",148
17114,GEORGE, I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..,148
17115,WYCK, These aren't standardized tests - these are his grades.,148
17116,GEORGE," Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be  an architect.",148
17117,WYCK, Is that right?,148
17118,STEVEN," Actually, maybe I could set my sights a little bit higher.",148
17119,GEORGE,"  Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.",148
17120,STEVEN," I think I'd really like to be a city planner.  Why limit myself to just one building, when I can design a whole city?",148
17121,WYCK," Well, that's a good point.",148
17122,GEORGE,"  No, it's not.",148
17123,STEVEN," Well, isn't an architect just an art school drop-out with a tilty desk, and a big ruler? ",148
17124,GEORGE,  It's called a T-square.,148
17125,WYCK," You know, the stupidest guy in my fraternity became an architect - after he flunked out of dental school!  Contratulations, young man. ",148
17126,STEVEN, Thank you.,148

17130,PETERMAN,"  Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn.. ",148
17131,KRAMER," You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? ",148
17132,ELAINE," No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -",148
17133,PETERMAN,  How much would you take for the whole lot?,148
17134,KRAMER, My whole lot?,148
17135,PETERMAN," Name your price, man!",148

17141,ELAINE, Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!,148
17142,KRAMER," Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.",148
17143,ELAINE, What happened to Bob Saccamano?,148
17144,KRAMER," Well, nothing. His part of the story is done.  So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.",148
17145,ELAINE," Alright, well, now that's something..",148
17146,KRAMER," Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..",148
17147,ELAINE,  A train is bearing down on you?!,148
17148,KRAMER," No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.",148
17149,ELAINE,  I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?,148
17150,KRAMER," Well, I guess I was..",148
17151,ELAINE,  What were you gonna wear on the way back?,148
17152,KRAMER," Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there!  All right, next story..",148
17153,ELAINE," Alright, I think I got enough for one day.",148
17154,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, chew on that.",148
17155,ELAINE,"  Yeah, I'll chew on that.",148
17156,KRAMER," Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..",148
17157,ELAINE," Oh, thanks. I've got plans.",148

17159,ELAINE,"  Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?",148
17160,KRAMER," Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.",148
17161,JERRY, So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?,148
17162,GEORGE," I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.",148
17163,JERRY," You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field.  Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.",148
17164,GEORGE, You're spending the weekend with Ellen?,148
17165,JERRY,"  Vermont!  With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to!  Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye.  What?  What is this?",148
17166,GEORGE,  You want to start?,148
17167,KRAMER,"  Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.",148
17168,GEORGE," Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.",148
17169,JERRY, What?!,148
17170,KRAMER,"  Jerry, she's a loser. ",148
17171,JERRY, Where is this coming from? She's great!,148
17172,GEORGE,"  Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.",148
17173,JERRY, There's nothing wrong with my career!,148
17174,KRAMER,"  Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.",148
17175,GEORGE, I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!,148
17176,KRAMER," Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.",148
17177,GEORGE," Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!",148
17178,KRAMER," Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated.",148
17179,JERRY,  Alright! Excuse me!  I'm not buying any of this!,148
17180,KRAMER," All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!",148
17181,JERRY," You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!",148
17182,KRAMER, Which one?,148
17183,JERRY, They were all like that!,148
17184,STEVEN," Why'd you take away my scholarship, Mister Costanza?",148

17206,KRAMER," Hey, now, they're tough cookies.",148
17207,GEORGE," Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?",148
17208,KRAMER," Uh.. ah,  Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying. ",148
17209,GEORGE,"  Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!",148
17210,KRAMER," Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.",148
17211,GEORGE," You mean, like, a former member?",148
17212,ELAINE," These Kramer stories are unusable!  I mean, some of them aren't even stories!  Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!",148
17213,JERRY, Is my toaster oven on there?,148
17214,ELAINE, How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?,148

17224,KRAMER," Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story!  So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! ",148

17232,PETERMAN," Well, it started out nicely",148
17233,ELAINE," Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!",148
17234,PETERMAN," It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing.",148
17235,ELAINE," Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?",148

17243,KRAMER, Yippie-yi-yay!,148
17244,PETERMAN,"  There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create.  And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix.",148

17381,GEORGE,"  ""Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome."" ",149
17382,ALLISON,"  George? Are you there?  I hate that stupid message.  I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. ",149
17383,GEORGE,"  Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball..  Ha ha!",149

17392,ELAINE," No, still Sharon!",149
17393,KRAMER,  Hey. ,149
17394,JERRY," Hey, I thought you went to the game.",149
17395,KRAMER, No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. ,149
17396,JERRY, Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!,149

17399,KRAMER, Yeah. ,149
17400,JERRY," Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!",149
17401,KRAMER,"  Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. ",149
17402,ELAINE,"  --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--",149
17403,JERRY," Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean ""involved""?!",149
17404,KRAMER,"  Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. ""Involved."" An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.",149
17405,ELAINE, So that's it?,149
17406,KRAMER," Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. ",149
17407,JERRY, Can you believe that?,149
17408,ELAINE, I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.,149
17409,KRAMER,  The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!,149
17410,JERRY," What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!",149
17411,KRAMER," No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!",149

17419,ELAINE, Su-sie?,149
17420,PETERMAN," Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk. Peggy says this ""Suze"" isn't much of a Worker.",149
17421,ELAINE,  It's Susie.,149
17422,PETERMAN," Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.",149
17423,ELAINE,"  Ah, all o'--all of us?",149
17424,KRAMER, Allison. Hi. Uh--listen,149

17426,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.",149
17427,ALLISON, Oh yeah?,149
17428,JERRY,"  Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.",149
17429,MIKE,  Hey. Jerry.,149
17430,JERRY, Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?,149
17431,MIKE,"  Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.",149
17432,JERRY, Why not?,149
17433,MIKE, 'Cause I don't have the money..,149
17434,JERRY," Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. ""Phony""?",149
17435,MIKE, Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!,149
17436,JERRY," You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.",149
17437,MIKE, I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.,149
17438,JERRY,  Something wrong with this trunk.,149
17439,MIKE, Oh. Let me see.,149
17440,GEORGE," So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?  An' why Pomodoro?",149
17441,KRAMER,"  Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.",149
17442,GEORGE,  Uh-oh.,149
17443,KRAMER," We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.",149
17444,GEORGE, Can't we discuss this?,149
17445,KRAMER,  We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!,149
17446,GEORGE,  I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!,149
17447,KRAMER,"  So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. ",149
17448,GEORGE,  Are you?,149
17449,KRAMER, Wha--me? No! No. But she is.,149

17455,PETERMAN, Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.,149
17456,ELAINE," Oh. No, we're not--",149
17457,PEGGY, Susie has been very rude to me.,149
17458,PETERMAN," Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.",149
17459,ELAINE," Look.  We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..  name names!  Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--",149
17460,PETERMAN," Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. ",149
17461,ELAINE," Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.",149
17462,PETERMAN, Who.,149
17463,ELAINE,  Her?,149
17464,PETERMAN, Where is she?!,149
17465,ELAINE, Ah--this is part of the problem!,149
17466,PEGGY," Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.",149
17467,ELAINE,"  You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!",149
17468,PETERMAN," Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.",149
17469,ELAINE,"  What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. ",149
17470,PETERMAN, She is The Best. What was your name again.,149
17471,KRAMER, Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.,149
17472,JERRY, Well why doesn't he just come in?,149
17473,KRAMER," Because he's scared, Jerry.",149
17474,JERRY, Why is he scared.,149
17475,KRAMER,  Come on in. Did you do this? ,149
17476,JERRY," Yeah, but--",149
17477,KRAMER, Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.,149
17478,JERRY, It was an accident.,149
17479,KRAMER," Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?",149
17480,MIKE,"  I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!",149
17481,JERRY,  I don't want it that way.,149
17482,KRAMER," Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.",149
17483,JERRY,  Fine..,149

17500,ELAINE," Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.",149
17501,JERRY," Yeah, I know how you feel.",149
17502,ELAINE, Do you hear something?,149
17503,JERRY, What?,149
17504,JERRY," Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.",149
17505,ELAINE," Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!",149
17506,JERRY," Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.",149
17507,ELAINE, What?,149
17508,JERRY,  Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.,149

17533,JERRY,  Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..,149
17534,ELAINE,  Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.,149
17535,PEGGY,  Oh my god!  Susie?,149
17536,ELAINE,"  Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.",149
17537,PEGGY, But I've been calling you Susie.,149
17538,ELAINE, Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. ,149
17539,PEGGY, I guess I never met Susie.,149
17540,JERRY,  Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.  Her too.,149
17541,ELAINE, What can you say about a girl like Susie? ,149
17542,KRAMER, Hey.,149
17543,GEORGE," Where's uh, where's Allison..",149
17544,KRAMER," Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.",149
17545,GEORGE, But you took me back.,149
17546,KRAMER," Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. ",149
17547,GEORGE, Where are you goin'..,149
17548,KRAMER," The Ball, silly.",149
17549,GEORGE,"  No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.",149
17550,KRAMER, George. I thought you were gonna Change.,149
17551,GEORGE,  For her. Not for you.,149
17552,KRAMER,"  Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..",149
17553,GEORGE," All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!",149
17554,WILHELM," Wow! What an, Entrance!  And eh, who might this be?",149
17555,KRAMER," Oh, I'm with him.",149
17556,WILHELM, Oh. Ah-ha..,149
17557,ELAINE," And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.",149
17558,PETERMAN, Elaine! May I say a few words.,149
17559,ELAINE," Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. ",149
17560,PETERMAN,"  Ahhh. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation. And it was Pretty Good.",149
17561,JERRY,"  Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. ",149
17562,PETERMAN, But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help.  An' nowww.. Susie is gone.,149
17563,MIKE,"  Hold on! Hol--on! Susie didn't commit suicide!  She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!",149
17564,JERRY,"  Not only that, I broke his thumbs.",149
17565,PETERMAN," Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.",149
17566,ELAINE, Mr. Peterman..  I'm Susie.. She's me..,149
17567,PETERMAN,"  I feel the same way.  And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. ",149
17568,ELAINE,  Suuuuuuuuuuze!,149
17569,JERRY," Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, ""Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. "" ""What are you watching?"" ""I don't care, I gotta keep going."" ""Who was that?"" ""I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going."" Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, ""Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel."" You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, ""Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed.""",15
17570,GEORGE,"  She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.",15
17571,JERRY," She's the performance artist, right?",15
17572,GEORGE,"  Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.",15
17573,JERRY," What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?",15
17574,ELAINE, Todd.,15
17575,JERRY, Todd. Oh yeah.  He's a Kennedy.,15
17576,ELAINE," No, he's not.",15
17577,JERRY," C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.",15
17578,ELAINE, By marriage.,15
17579,JERRY," Oh, by marriage.  We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.",15
17580,GEORGE, That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.,15
17581,ELAINE," Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.",15
17582,GEORGE," What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?",15
17583,JERRY," Thin ice, George. Thin ice..",15
17584,GEORGE,  Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.,15
17585,ELAINE, She stopped performing.,15
17586,GEORGE,"  Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.",15
17587,JERRY,  You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.,15
17588,GEORGE," She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her ""performances"".",15
17589,JERRY," Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?",15
17590,GEORGE," God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.",15
17591,ELAINE, It was an accident!,15
17592,GEORGE," Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. ""What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?""",15
17593,JERRY,  he thought he still had a shot.,15
17594,GEORGE," And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.",15
17595,JERRY, What ever happened with the shirt?,15
17596,GEORGE, I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.,15
17597,ELAINE, I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.,15
17598,JERRY, Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?,15
17599,ELAINE," anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.",15
17600,GEORGE, Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.,15
17601,JERRY, Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.,15
17602,GEORGE,  Ich bin ein sucker.,15
17603,ELAINE," Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..",15
17604,GEORGE, She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!,15
17605,ELAINE,"  I do have one teeny little problem, though.",15
17606,GEORGE, Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.,15
17607,ELAINE," See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..",15
17608,JERRY, But?,15
17609,ELAINE, My roommate has Lyme disease.,15
17610,JERRY, Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?,15
17611,ELAINE, She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.,15
17612,JERRY, How did she get Lyme disease?,15
17613,ELAINE," I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.",15
17614,JERRY, They still do that play?,15
17615,ELAINE, It's a classic.,15
17616,JERRY, With all the nudity?,15
17617,ELAINE, I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.,15
17618,GEORGE,  Never said goodbye. Goodbye!,15
17619,JERRY, Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.,15
17620,ELAINE, What do you wanna know?,15
17621,JERRY," Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?",15
17622,ELAINE, Rarely.,15
17623,JERRY," There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?",15
17624,ELAINE, No.,15
17625,JERRY, When is this suppose to be?,15
17626,ELAINE, Saturday.,15
17627,JERRY," Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?",15
17628,ELAINE, I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.,15
17629,JERRY," 'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.",15
17630,GEORGE," Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.",15
17631,JERRY, And if you do?,15
17632,GEORGE, I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.,15
17633,KRAMER, What are you doing this for? Look at you..,15
17634,JERRY, Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.,15
17635,KRAMER, But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.,15
17636,JERRY,  Leave me alone.,15
17637,KRAMER, It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!,15
17638,JERRY, I'm not getting illegal cable!,15
17639,KRAMER," Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.",15
17640,JERRY," No, I read in the paper..",15
17641,KRAMER,"  Oh, oh, the paper..",15
17642,JERRY," Well, they might hook us up again.",15
17643,KRAMER," Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the ""Big Mammoo.""  Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!",15
17644,JERRY, Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.,15
17645,KRAMER," Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!",15
17646,JERRY, What you're suggesting is illegal.,15
17647,KRAMER, It's not illegal.,15
17648,JERRY, It's against the law.,15
17649,KRAMER," Well, yeah.",15
17650,JERRY,"  Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?",15
17651,KRAMER,"  Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.",15
17652,JERRY," A real human rights nut, huh?",15
17653,KRAMER," Yeah. He's intense, man.",15
17654,JERRY, I don't know. What if I get caught?,15
17655,KRAMER," Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.",15
17656,JERRY," You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.",15
17657,TABACHNICK, Tomarrow okay.,15
17658,KRAMER," No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.",15
17659,JERRY,"  Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..",15
17660,KRAMER," No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..",15
17661,JERRY,  Put it in.,15
17662,KRAMER," You won't regret it.  Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..",15
17663,MAN, Mr. Steinfeld?,15
17664,JERRY, Seinfeld.,15
17665,MAN, We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up?,15
17666,JERRY, My cable hook-up? What about it?,15
17667,MAN," It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld.",15
17668,JERRY, It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?,15
17669,KRAMER," Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.",15
17670,MAN," You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.",15
17671,JERRY," Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.",15
17672,TABACHNICK," Mr. Seinfeld, Agent Stone. FBI. Undercover.",15
17673,KRAMER," No! Jerry!  Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..",15
17674,JERRY, Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?,15
17675,STEWARDESS, I'm afraid not.,15
17676,JERRY," What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?",15
17677,STEWARDESS, No sir. We're flying into a blizzard. Please fasten your seat belt. We're making an emergency landing.,15
17678,JERRY,  Are they gonna go over the instructions again?,15
17679,BILL, My name is Bill. I might be the last person you ever see.,15
17680,JERRY," I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, ""This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here.""",15
17681,GEORGE, Sounds like a rough trip.,15
17682,JERRY," Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.",15
17683,GEORGE," So, the college cancelled the gig?",15
17684,JERRY," Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.",15
17685,GEORGE,  Forget it.,15
17686,JERRY," No, really.. an airport run.",15
17687,GEORGE, It's nothing.,15
17688,JERRY," Hey, it's one thing if I asked you ""Could you do me a favor?"" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE",15
17689,JERRY,"  You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.",15
17690,GEORGE,  ..Ulterior motive.,15
17691,JERRY," Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.",15
17692,GEORGE,"  What, tonight? Now?",15
17693,JERRY," Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.",15
17694,GEORGE," My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.",15
17695,JERRY, You want to get a bite?,15
17696,GEORGE," Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.",15
17697,JERRY," Well, so what should we do?",15
17698,GEORGE, Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?,15
17699,JERRY, Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!,15
17700,GEORGE,  What are you talking about?,15
17701,JERRY, You're wearing the chocolate shirt!,15
17702,GEORGE, I am? What a strange coincidence..,15
17703,JERRY," A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..",15
17704,GEORGE,  You gotta let me go over there.,15
17705,JERRY," What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?",15
17706,GEORGE," No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, ""Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!""",15
17707,LESLIE, We just bought an apartment on Riverside Drive. Bernard Goetz's mother used to live there.,15
17708,ELAINE," So, where's Todd?",15
17709,LESLIE, Up in Hyannisport.,15
17710,ELAINE," Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!",15
17711,WOMAN,"  So, when's your due date?",15
17712,LESLIE," March twentieth, nine a.m.",15
17713,WOMAN, You know the time!,15
17714,LESLIE," I'm having a planned C-section. My therapist told me if I go through labor, I might get psychotic.",15
17715,ELAINE," Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?",15
17716,LESLIE,"  Elaine, who catered this, Sears?",15
17717,ELAINE,  What is this?! What are you doing here?,15
17718,KRAMER, We're putting in cable.,15
17719,ELAINE," The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!",15
17720,KRAMER," Oh, we have to do this now.",15
17721,ELAINE, Who's this guy?,15
17722,KRAMER, Which one?,15
17723,ELAINE, Both of the them.,15
17724,KRAMER," Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys.",15
17725,ELAINE, Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?,15
17726,KRAMER," Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah.",15
17727,ELAINE, You can't! You can't do this now!,15
17728,KRAMER," Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.",15
17729,ELAINE, Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.,15
17730,KRAMER,"  Anatoly!  Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.",15
17731,JERRY, And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?,15
17732,GEORGE,  What am I going to say?!,15
17733,JERRY, Yeah.,15
17734,GEORGE," What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!",15
17735,JERRY, You'll never say that to her face.,15
17736,GEORGE, Watch me.,15
17737,KRAMER,"  Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.",15
17738,ELAINE,"  Kramer, Kramer, look at him.  Look! He's eating all the food!",15
17739,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition.  Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?",15
17740,ELAINE, Kramer!,15
17741,KRAMER,  Uh.. Excuse me..,15
17742,ELAINE, What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.,15
17743,JERRY, The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.,15
17744,ELAINE," I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.",15
17745,LESLIE," Jerry, what a surprise! I thought you sere out of town.",15
17746,JERRY," Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.",15
17747,ELAINE,"  George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!",15
17748,GEORGE,  About what?,15
17749,TABACHNICK,"  Kramer, Kramer, Kramer..",15
17750,GEORGE, Leslie.,15
17751,LESLIE, Yeah?,15
17752,GEORGE, George..  George Costanza.,15
17753,LESLIE, Hi.,15
17754,GEORGE,"  You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?",15
17755,LESLIE, Vaguely.,15
17756,GEORGE, You took me to one of your shows..,15
17757,LESLIE, And?,15
17758,GEORGE," And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..",15
17759,MARY, Jerry?!  Remember me?,15
17760,JERRY," I'm sorry, I..",15
17761,MARY,"  Mary Contardi. No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry? We had a date, three years ago. You took me to one of your shows.",15
17762,JERRY,"  Oh, I, I, think I remember..",15
17763,MARY, Told me you had a great time! Said you'd call me the next day.,15
17764,JERRY," Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..",15
17765,MARY," Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into me again! But you were wrong, Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think, I'm some sort of poor, pathetic wretch?!",15
17766,JERRY," No, I don't think that..",15
17767,MARRY, Some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! Some insignificant piece of dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve your respect and your attention?! You're the one that doesn't deserve my respect and my attention! You're the insignificant piece of dust!,15
17768,GEORGE," Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..",15
17769,LESLIE, Thanks a lot!,15
17770,ELAINE, I'm sorry you have to go.,15
17771,WOMAN, Yeah. I really have to be going.,15
17772,JERRY," Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.",15
17773,KRAMER, Don't be a fool.,15
17774,TABACHNICK, You don't want?,15
17775,JERRY," No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..",15
17776,TABACHNICK,  Four hundred dollars.,15
17777,JERRY,  Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!,15
17778,LESLIE, I'm going.. obviously.,15
17779,ELAINE," Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..",15
17780,LESLIE," Elaine, you know, I was watching you tonight, and I realized something. You're just like you were in college.",15
17781,ELAINE,"  Oh, thank you.  ""Like you were in college""?",15
17782,LESLIE,  Come on! Let's go!,15
17783,GEORGE,  I'll be right back. ,15
17784,JERRY,  I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!,15
17785,GEORGE," Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?",15
17786,ELAINE," Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.",15
17787,JERRY," Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?",15
17788,KRAMER,"  Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! ",15
17789,JERRY," What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. ""I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around."" ""Take care now."" Did you ever say that to somebody? ""Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now."" ""Take care. Take care."" What does this mean? ""Take off!"" Isn't that what you really want to say? ""Take off now.""",15
17790,JENNA, Morning.,150
17791,JERRY, Morning.,150
17792,JENNA, Hope you don't mind baking soda flavour.,150
17793,JERRY,"  Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?",150
17794,JENNA, I'm gonna grab you a towel.,150
17795,JERRY, Ooh-ooh,150
17796,GEORGE, So?,150
17797,JERRY, So? She used the toothbrush!,150
17798,GEORGE," You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?",150
17799,JERRY, Yeah.,150
17800,GEORGE," So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.",150
17801,JERRY, How many years of med school did you have?,150
17802,GEORGE, Was she mad?,150
17803,GEORGE, You didn't tell her.,150
17804,JERRY, Jenna's like me. She's very... ,150
17805,GEORGE, Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?,150
17806,JERRY, I'll take fastidious.,150
17807,JERRY, What is that?,150
17808,GEORGE," Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.",150
17809,HEAD, Holy cow!,150
17810,JERRY," They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?",150
17811,GEORGE, Just the last few innings of a double-header.,150
17812,KRAMER," Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and  Dragged this thing for five exits.",150
17813,JERRY, Why didn't you pull over?,150
17814,KRAMER," Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.",150
17815,HEAD, Holy cow!,150
17816,KRAMER," Well, look at that. A talking Nixon.",150
17817,OWNER, China Panda.,150
17818,ELAINE," Yeah, I'd like to place an order.",150
17819,OWNER," Ah yes, what you like?",150
17820,ELAINE," This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?",150
17821,OWNER, What number?,150
17822,ELAINE, Forty-seven.,150
17823,OWNER," Yeah, first time. What else?",150
17824,ELAINE," Uh, that's it.",150
17825,OWNER, Address?,150
17826,ELAINE," Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E.",150
17827,OWNER," That's southside. Sorry, we don't deliver below Eighty-sixth.",150
17828,ELAINE, I'm not below.,150
17829,OWNER, Yes you are. Street itself is boundary.,150
17830,ELAINE, Your guy can't cross to my side?,150
17831,OWNER," If we deliver to you, then what? Eighty-fifth Street, Wall Street, Mexico, Eighty-fourth Street.",150
17832,ELAINE," Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.",150
17833,OWNER," Sorry, food only for those who live within boundary. ",150
17834,OWNER,  China Panda.,150
17835,ELAINE,"  Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.",150
17836,OWNER," Ah, what you like?",150
17837,KRAMER," Well, I'm a poppa.",150
17838,JERRY, Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.,150
17839,KRAMER,"  Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.",150
17840,JERRY," Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing.",150
17841,KRAMER," Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.",150
17842,JERRY," Aw, looks just like you.",150
17843,KRAMER," Aw, I'm beaming Jerry.",150
17844,JERRY, So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?,150
17845,KRAMER," They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.",150
17846,JERRY, That old scam.,150
17847,KRAMER," Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.",150
17848,JERRY," At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.",150
17849,KRAMER, Quality time.,150
17850,GEORGE, Keys. I can't find my keys.,150
17851,JERRY, You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!,150
17852,GEORGE, Have you seen 'em?,150
17853,JERRY, No.,150
17854,GEORGE, Dammit!,150
17855,KRAMER," C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?",150
17856,GEORGE," I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.",150
17857,KRAMER, Right.,150
17858,JERRY," Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.",150
17859,GEORGE, I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.,150
17860,JERRY, So?,150
17861,GEORGE, So you can't duplicate 'em.,150
17862,KRAMER, Sure you can.  Such a sweet kid.,150
17863,ELAINE," Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda?",150
17864,DELIVERY BOY,  Why you waiting on the street and not in your apartment?,150
17865,ELAINE, I... thought that I would meet you halfway.,150
17866,DELIVERY BOY, You really live here?,150
17867,ELAINE," Oh yeah.  There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.",150
17868,ELAINE,  This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!,150
17869,JERRY," Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.",150
17870,GEORGE, So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?,150
17871,JERRY," By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?",150
17872,GEORGE," No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!",150
17873,GEORGE," Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.",150
17874,JERRY, You didn't look down?,150
17875,GEORGE, I was trying to stick the landing.  ...was right around here.,150
17876,GEORGE, No! No!!,150
17877,HEAD ," Holy, Holy Cow!",150
17878,JERRY, Poor son of a bitch.,150
17879,JERRY, It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.,150
17880,JENNA, It's like I'm holding a blender.,150
17881,JERRY, The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.,150
17882,JERRY," Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.",150
17883,JENNA,"  Really, it does?",150
17884,JERRY,  When the battery runs out.,150
17885,JENNA,  I was really happy with my old toothbrush.,150
17886,JERRY," No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.",150
17887,JENNA , That stuff tastes like bleach!,150
17888,JERRY, I don't know anything about that.,150
17889,JENNA, Mmm. My mouth feels so clean.,150
17890,JERRY, That's the idea.,150
17891,JERRY," You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.",150
17892,JENNA," Aww. Okay. Thanks, I guess.",150
17893,ELAINE, You still couldn't kiss her?,150
17894,JERRY," She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.",150
17895,ELAINE," Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.",150
17896,JERRY," Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.",150
17897,ELAINE," Jer, do you see where this is going?",150
17898,JERRY, Being really clean and happy?,150
17899,ELAINE," Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.",150
17900,JERRY, Disorder?,150
17901,ELAINE," And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.",150
17902,JERRY,"  Hmm, that could hurt me.  Hey, there it is.",150
17903,ELAINE, Shall we stop and say hi?,150
17904,JERRY," Nah, we've seen it.",150
17905,ELAINE, Yeah.,150
17906,KRAMER,"  Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!",150
17907,KRAMER," Mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle.",150
17908,MAN, Yeah?,150
17909,ELAINE," Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh,  I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?",150
17910,MAN, Wha? What d'you want?,150
17911,ELAINE," You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.",150
17912,MAN," Wh, when is that?",150
17913,ELAINE," No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.",150
17914,MAN, Who are you with?,150
17915,ELAINE," No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.",150
17916,MAN, Who let you in?,150
17917,ELAINE," Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.",150
17918,JERRY, What's with the signs?,150
17919,KRAMER," Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts , I just rolled 'em into the woods.",150
17920,JERRY," Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.",150
17921,KRAMER,"  Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there.  Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.",150
17922,JERRY," Hey. So, keys?",150
17923,GEORGE, No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.,150
17924,JERRY, I guess they leave that up to the general population.,150
17925,GEORGE," I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!",150
17926,JERRY, Hard to say.,150
17927,KRAMER," Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.",150
17928,GEORGE, Really?,150
17929,KRAMER," Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.",150
17930,JERRY, Yeah?,150
17931,JENNA , It's Jenna.,150
17932,JERRY," If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.",150
17933,GEORGE, You think you could hook me up with these guys?,150
17934,KRAMER," Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.",150
17935,GEORGE, Seven-eight-four.,150
17936,JENNA, Hey.,150
17937,JERRY, Hi.,150
17938,JENNA, How you feeling?,150
17939,JERRY," Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.",150
17940,JENNA, What?!,150
17941,JERRY," Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip,  and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.",150
17942,JENNA, What?,150
17943,JERRY, I'm sorry.,150
17944,JENNA, When were you gonna tell me this?!,150
17945,JERRY, Obviously never.,150
17946,KRAMER, I need the yield sign.,150
17947,JERRY," Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?",150
17948,KRAMER, You could've introduced me.,150
17949,JERRY, I wouldn't know where to start.,150
17950,JERRY,"  Hey, Jenna. Hey!",150
17951,JENNA, There. Now something of yours has been in the toilet.,150
17952,JERRY, What?! Wha... what'd you put in there?,150
17953,JENNA, Gotta run.,150
17954,JERRY," Oh, man!",150
17955,JERRY,"  Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!",150
17956,ELAINE, She won't even give you a hint?,150
17957,JERRY, No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.,150
17958,ELAINE, You know what I bet it is?  Your remote.,150
17959,JERRY," Yes, that is a definite possibility.",150
17960,ELAINE,"  Or, could be your walkman there.",150
17961,JERRY, Are you just screwing with me?,150
17962,ELAINE," Yeah, I am.",150
17963,KRAMER, Hey ah.,150
17964,JERRY," Hey, how's life on the road?",150
17965,KRAMER," Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry.",150
17966,JERRY, I don't doubt it.,150
17967,KRAMER," You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.",150
17968,JERRY, What's this?,150
17969,KRAMER," Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? ",150
17970,JERRY, Isn't that some kind of safety thing?,150
17971,KRAMER," Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.",150
17972,JERRY, What the hell are you talking about?,150
17973,KRAMER," Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.",150
17974,ELAINE, How are you gonna widen the lanes?,150
17975,KRAMER," Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise.  So, you got any black paint?",150
17976,JERRY,"  Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.",150
17977,ELAINE,"  Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.",150
17978,JERRY, One-Q? Whose apartment is that?,150
17979,ELAINE," That's the janitor closet, across the street.",150
17980,JERRY," You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?",150
17981,ELAINE," It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.",150
17982,KRAMER, That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.,150
17983,ELAINE,  How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.,150
17984,KRAMER," Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.",150
17985,ELAINE," Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.",150
17986,KRAMER," Now, where's that tool shed of yours?",150
17987,ELAINE," Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.",150
17988,ELAINE, I'll see you.,150
17989,RALPH, You Costanza?,150
17990,GEORGE," Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.",150
17991,RALPH, What're the keys doing in there?,150
17992,GEORGE," Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.",150
17993,RALPH, You put 'em in there?,150
17994,GEORGE," Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.",150
17995,RALPH, Bad place to put your keys.,150
17996,GEORGE," Yeah, I know that.  Could you start, working?",150
17997,RALPH," Difficult job. You want those keys, we're gonna have to dig this up.",150
17998,GEORGE,"  Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.  Is this about money?",150
17999,RALPH, Yeah.  It's about money.,150
18000,MRS ALLISTER," 'Scuse me, what are you doing in there?",150
18001,ELAINE," Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.",150
18002,MRS ALLISTER," You were hanging around in there, lazing on the job. When you shoulda been downstairs in the basement, cleaning out those old carpets and scrap wood.",150
18003,ELAINE," Right, because... I'm the janitor. ",150
18004,MRS ALLISTER, Don't get smart with me.,150
18005,ELAINE,  Yes ma'am.,150
18006,RADIO," Hey, and if you're heading north on the Arthur Berkhardt, whoah Nelly, for some reason four lanes are converging into two, instantaneously right at mile-marker one-fourteen. I don't know what that is, but the A-B's a parking lot out there. Somebody screwed up on that one.",150
18007,ELAINE, Oh it's you.,150
18008,JERRY, Is the flounder here yet?,150
18009,ELAINE," No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?",150
18010,ELAINE,  There's this.,150
18011,JERRY," Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.",150
18012,ELAINE,  The fish!,150
18013,ELAINE," Ah, what're you doing here?",150
18014,GEORGE, Hey.,150
18015,JERRY, Hey.,150
18016,GEORGE," Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.",150
18017,JERRY, Kramer's guys?,150
18018,GEORGE, Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.,150
18019,JERRY," Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.",150
18020,GEORGE, Ow!,150
18021,ELAINE," Uh, man!",150
18022,KRAMER," Huh, yeah.  Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.",150
18023,ELAINE, I'm plumb out.,150
18024,KRAMER," Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!",150
18025,MRS ALLISTER , Janitor?,150
18026,ELAINE,"  Uh, Mrs Allister.  Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister.  Okay, I've gotta get out.",150
18027,ELAINE," Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.",150
18028,ELAINE," Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?",150
18029,MRS ALLISTER, I told you yesterday to haul that trash outta the basement.,150
18030,ELAINE," Yeah, I am so sorry.",150
18031,MRS ALLISTER, Some of the children have been playing near it and putting it in their mouths.,150
18032,ELAINE," Well, a lot of it is vegetable...",150
18033,MRS ALLISTER," Get that stuff outta there today, or you'll be outta here. Understand?",150
18034,ELAINE,  Yes ma'am.,150
18035,GEORGE, ...stop pushing.  Kramer spilled ammonia.,150
18036,JERRY, I don't feel like eating.,150
18037,KRAMER,"  I'm gonna borrow this, huh?",150
18038,ELAINE,  Janitor's meeting.,150
18039,JENNA," So Jerry, why'd you call me?",150
18040,JERRY," Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl.  Did you?",150
18041,JENNA," Yes, I did.",150
18042,JERRY," Well, whatever. So, how've you been?",150
18043,JENNA, Good.,150
18044,JERRY, Good.  Steak knife?,150
18045,JENNA, Just eating away at you isn't it?,150
18046,JERRY, Nah.,150
18047,ELAINE, Hi.,150
18048,JENNA, Hi.,150
18049,JERRY, Hi.,150
18050,ELAINE," Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?",150
18051,JERRY, For what?,150
18052,ELAINE, I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.,150
18053,JERRY," Dirt? That's alright,  because there's nothing wrong with dirt.",150
18054,ELAINE," Well, actually it's pretty grimy.",150
18055,JERRY," Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.",150
18056,ELAINE," Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.",150
18057,JERRY, Sure. Bye.,150
18058,ELAINE, Bye.,150
18059,JENNA, Bye.,150
18060,ELAINE, Bye.,150
18061,JERRY," There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of...  Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!",150
18062,JENNA, Toilet brush.,150
18063,JERRY," Toilet brush, oh . Alright, I can replace that.",150
18064,JENNA, You wanna order dinner?,150
18065,JERRY," Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.",150
18066,JERRY, That's true.,150
18067,JENNA, Mm.,150
18068,JERRY," But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.",150
18069,JENNA, Do you hear something?,150
18070,JERRY, I don't know what that could be.,150
18071,HEAD, Holy cow!,150
18072,JERRY," Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.",150
18073,JERRY, Holy cow! Have a nice life.,150
18074,ELAINE," Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.",150
18075,KRAMER, Bugger!,150
18076,NEWMAN,  You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.,150
18077,NEWMAN, What the hell was that?,150
18078,KRAMER, Double bugger!,150
18079,NEWMAN,"  Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times...",150
18080,NEWMAN," Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!",150
18081,KRAMER, Hey buddy. What're you doing out here?,150
18082,KRAMER," Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.",150
18083,KRAMER," Hey, I gotta skedaddle. You wanna lift?",150
18084,KRAMER, Newman! Newman!!,150
18085,KRAMER," Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.",150
18086,JERRY," You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?",151
18087,ELAINE, Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?,151
18088,JERRY, He's wailing on that banjo.,151
18089,ELAINE, Yeah.,151
18090,JERRY, I just don't understand the raisinettes.,151
18091,ELAINE, The sax player?,151
18092,JERRY, Yeah.,151
18093,ELAINE, Yeah.,151
18094,JERRY," The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.",151
18095,ELAINE, So?,151
18096,JERRY, Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.,151
18097,ELAINE, HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.,151
18098,JERRY, Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.,151
18099,ELAINE, He's a musician.,151
18100,JERRY, Musicians. Get a real job.,151
18101,WAITRESS, What d'you want?,151
18102,GEORGE," Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.",151
18103,DANIELLE,  Neil.,151
18104,DANIELLE, Neil.,151
18105,DANIELLE,"  Oh, I am sorry.  I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend here. He looks just like you.",151
18106,GEORGE,  Really?,151
18107,DANIELLE,  Yeah.,151
18108,GEORGE,  Like me?,151
18109,DANIELLE, Uh-huh. Sorry.,151
18110,GEORGE,  Like me? But how?,151
18111,WAITRESS, Here's your halibut omelette. Surprised?,151
18112,GEORGE," Yes, yes, I am.",151
18113,KRAMER," Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.",151
18114,KRAMER, Saved a fortune. Look at that. Heyy.,151
18115,JERRY,"  Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'.",151
18116,KRAMER, Yeah.,151
18117,JERRY,"  Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.",151
18118,KRAMER, Hey.,151
18119,GEORGE, Hey.,151
18120,JERRY, Hey.,151
18121,GEORGE, Hey. You ready?,151
18122,JERRY, Almost.,151
18123,KRAMER," Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house?",151
18124,JERRY,"  Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.",151
18125,KRAMER," Aw, c'mon man. Help a brother out.",151
18126,JERRY,  Alright.,151
18127,KRAMER, Yeahh. I owe you one.,151
18128,JERRY,  We're even.,151
18129,GEORGE," Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.",151
18130,JERRY,  That's a nice four seconds.,151
18131,GEORGE,  I look just like him. I. Me.  This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?,151
18132,JERRY, Maybe he has money.,151
18133,GEORGE,"  Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.",151
18134,JERRY,  Sometimes you do.,151
18135,GEORGE," Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.",151
18136,JERRY,  Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?,151
18137,GEORGE,"  She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.",151
18138,BLAINE," So, what d'you wanna see?",151
18139,ELAINE,  What about Sack Lunch?,151
18140,BLAINE,  How about The English Patient? It's up for all those Oscars.,151
18141,ELAINE," Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.",151
18142,BLAINE, It's a family in a brown paper bag.,151
18143,ELAINE,  Don't you wanna know how they got in there?,151
18144,BLAINE, No.,151
18145,ELAINE,  Aww. Sold out.,151
18146,BLAINE,"  Oh, two for The English Patient.",151
18147,ELAINE," So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?",151
18148,GEORGE,"  Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?",151
18149,DANIELLE,  Hi.,151
18150,GEORGE," Huh-Hi.  Uhm, is Neil here?",151
18151,DANIELLE," Oh, no. He got held up at work.",151
18152,GEORGE," Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.",151
18153,DANIELLE," Well, you know, you don't look that much like him.",151
18154,GEORGE,  Oh. Course not.,151
18155,DANIELLE," No, you're a little taller.",151
18156,DANIELLE, You look like you're in better shape than Neil. Do you work out?,151
18157,GEORGE,"  Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...",151
18158,GEORGE, ...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?,151
18159,ELAINE,"  Why is everyone talking about ""The English Patient, it's so romantic"".  God, that movie stunk!",151
18160,BLAINE, I kinda liked it.,151
18161,ELAINE,  No you didn't.,151
18162,CAROL," Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?",151
18163,GAIL,  Didn't you love it?,151

18181,JERRY,  I..I didn't say that.,151
18182,SID,"  Hey, Izzy, this kid says he can lift more than you can.",151

18210,BLAINE,"  Well, to tell you the truth Elaine. I don't know if I can be with someone who doesn't like The English Patient.",151
18211,ELAINE, It's just a stupid movie.,151
18212,BLAINE,  That's what I'm talking about.,151
18213,CAROL,"  Come on, Blaine. Let's go.",151
18214,BLAINE,  Enjoy Sack Lunch!,151
18215,ELAINE,  I will!,151
18216,HELEN,  How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.,151

18227,GUILLERMO, What cigars?,151
18228,JERRY, Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.,151
18229,GUILLERMO,  We are the Cubans.,151
18230,KRAMER," Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.",151
18231,JERRY,"  They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!",151
18232,KRAMER, I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?,151
18233,JERRY, Cigars!,151
18234,KRAMER," Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.",151

18246,KRAMER, Damn!,151
18247,GEORGE," You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.",151
18248,DANIELLE, I wanted to give it to you in person.,151

18250,GEORGE, Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?,151

18253,DANIELLE," Well, goodnight.",151
18254,GEORGE,  I'll see you.,151
18255,WAITRESS, Rough night?,151
18256,ELAINE," Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me.  All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.",151
18257,WAITRESS, Really? I thought it was pretty good.,151
18258,ELAINE," Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it?  Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!",151
18259,WAITRESS,"  Well, I liked it.",151
18260,ELAINE,"  Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello?  You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!",151
18261,JERRY, This is quite a condo.,151
18262,MORTY, The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants.,151
18263,JERRY, The crepe place?,151
18264,MORTY, Yeah. This is all big crepe money.,151
18265,JERRY,  There's crepe money?,151
18266,IZZY, What are you doing here?,151
18267,JERRY,"  Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.",151
18268,IZZY, What the hell is that?,151
18269,JERRY, What?,151
18270,IZZY, That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?,151
18271,MORTY, This was a gift from my son.,151
18272,IZZY," Oh, I see how it works now.  He knocks me outta commission, so  you can strut around in your fancy number one shirt.  Well, I'll show you who's number one.",151
18273,JERRY," Mr Mandelbaum, please.",151
18274,IZZY, It's go time.,151
18275,IZZY,  Ahh. My back. I can't move.,151
18276,MORTY, Call an ambulance.,151
18277,JERRY, I think I saw one a coupla doors down.,151
18278,JERRY,"  So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!",151
18279,GEORGE,  Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.,151
18280,JERRY,"  George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.",151
18281,GEORGE,"  So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?",151
18282,JERRY," I don't know, but you better keep it up.",151
18283,GEORGE, I'm gonna go meet Danielle.  There's a new Neil in town!  Hahaha!,151
18284,JERRY,"  I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles.  Hello.",151
18285,MORTY, Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist?,151
18286,JERRY," I will, I just walked in the door.",151
18287,HELEN, You have to go see him.,151
18288,JERRY, Ma.,151

18290,HELEN," Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.",151
18291,MORTY," Number One, signing off.",151
18292,KRAMER," Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station.  What's going on!?",151
18293,JERRY, What?,151
18294,KRAMER,  They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans.,151
18295,JERRY, So?,151
18296,KRAMER," So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.",151
18297,JERRY, What's the difference?,151
18298,KRAMER," Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.",151
18299,JERRY,"  We're talking about people, right?",151
18300,KRAMER," Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.",151
18301,JERRY, I thought they smelled pretty nice.,151
18302,KRAMER," Jerry, your palate's unrefined.",151
18303,JERRY, Is not.,151
18304,KRAMER, Is too.,151
18305,JERRY, Is not.,151
18306,KRAMER, Is too.,151
18307,JERRY, I'm not having this conversation.,151

18310,KRAMER, Are too.,151
18311,JERRY, Am not.,151
18312,KRAMER, Are too.,151
18313,PETERMAN," Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient film last night. It was extraordinary.",151
18314,DUGAN,  Oh yes. It was so romantic. It ravished me.,151
18315,PETERMAN," Elaine, what'd you think?",151
18316,ELAINE,"  Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.",151
18317,PETERMAN,  You haven't seen it?,151
18318,ELAINE,  No.,151
18319,PETERMAN, That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.,151
18320,JERRY," Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.",151
18321,IZZY," Uh, oh, wait.",151
18322,IZZY," How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me.",151
18323,JERRY,  That's very nice.,151
18324,IZZY, The best in the world.  Which means I'm better than just number one.,151
18325,JERRY," Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.",151
18326,IZZY," Hi, son.",151
18327,IZZY JR., Hi daddy.,151
18328,JERRY,  This is your son?,151
18329,IZZY, I got married in high school.,151
18330,IZZY JR.,"  Hey, who are you?",151
18331,IZZY, This is Seinfeld's kid.,151
18332,IZZY JR.," Oh, you think you're tough, picking on an old man?  Maybe you'd like to try taking on somebody your own age.",151
18333,JERRY,  You got any kids?,151
18334,IZZY JR.," Oh, you think you're better than me?  Go ahead, pick out anything in the room here. I'll lift it up over my head.",151
18335,JERRY,"  Look, no-one is lifting anything.",151
18336,IZZY,  The television.,151
18337,JERRY,  Oh no.,151
18338,IZZY JR.," This one's for you, Pop. It's go time.",151
18339,IZZY JR.,  Ohh! My back!,151
18340,IZZY,  Call an ambulance.,151
18341,JERRY,  We're already in a hospital.,151
18342,HAFFLER," Awright, partner. Let's get down to business.",151
18343,KRAMER,"  Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.",151
18344,KRAMER, They're right out here.,151
18345,KRAMER," Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.",151
18346,HAFFLER," You wouldn't be trying to sell old Earl Haffler Dominicans in a Cuban wrapper now, would you?",151
18347,KRAMER,"  Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.",151
18348,HAFFLER,"  We're talking about people, right?",151
18349,KRAMER,  I think so.,151
18350,HAFFLER, I thought he quit smoking cigars.,151
18351,KRAMER," Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother...  ...Dennis.",151
18352,HAFFLER,  Dennis Castro?,151
18353,KRAMER," Uh, Dwayne.",151
18354,HAFFLER, Get the hell outta my office.,151
18355,KRAMER,  What!?,151
18356,DANIELLE," You know, Neil called me today.",151
18357,GEORGE,  Really?,151
18358,DANIELLE, Yeah. He's pretty upset that I broke up with him to go out with you.,151
18359,GEORGE,"  Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.",151
18360,DANIELLE, He wants to get together tomorrow night and have coffee.,151
18361,GEORGE,  Coffee?  I can beat that. Move in with me.,151
18362,DANIELLE,  What?,151
18363,GEORGE,  Beats the hell out of coffee.,151
18364,PETERMAN,  And I thought I knew what love was.,151
18365,ELAINE,  Yuh.,151
18366,JERRY,  You asked her to move in with you?,151
18367,GEORGE, I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.,151
18368,JERRY,  What if it's Neil Armstrong?,151
18369,GEORGE,  Then I'm going to Mars!,151
18370,JERRY, What if it's Neil Diamond?,151
18371,GEORGE,"  Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!",151
18372,JERRY," Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.",151
18373,GEORGE," What, to see the old guy?",151
18374,JERRY," No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.",151
18375,GEORGE, How old's the son?,151
18376,JERRY, I think he's the same age as the father.,151
18377,GEORGE, What is with this family?,151
18378,JERRY," I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.",151
18379,KRAMER,"  Hey, Jerry.",151
18380,KRAMER,  Datiditadit.,151
18381,JERRY, You're cold?,151
18382,KRAMER, No.   Ditadidatidat.,151
18383,JERRY, Something wrong with your chest?,151
18384,KRAMER,  Dijadidatjd. There.,151
18385,JERRY,  Where?,151
18386,KRAMER,"  No, no. Don't look. Don't look.",151
18387,KRAMER, Over there. The Dominicans.,151
18388,JERRY, Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?,151
18389,KRAMER," Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.",151
18390,GEORGE, So?,151
18391,KRAMER," So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.",151
18392,JERRY," Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.",151
18393,KRAMER,"  Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after?  El Presidente!",151
18394,JERRY," I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.",151
18395,IZZY JR.," I bet you pulled that trick on my daddy, in Florida.",151
18396,JERRY, He couldn't handle the weight.,151
18397,IZZY,"  Oh, so now you think you're better than me?",151
18398,IZZY JR.,  You think you're better than him?!,151
18399,JERRY,"  Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.",151
18400,IZZY, Okay.,151
18401,IZZY SR., My boys.,151
18402,IZZY, My dad.,151
18403,IZZY JR., My grandpa.,151
18404,JERRY,"  Oh, come on!",151
18405,IZZY SR.,  What happened to him?,151
18406,JERRY, He was trying to lift the TV.,151
18407,IZZY SR.,  That TV?,151
18408,JERRY,  Oh no.  It's go time.,151
18409,IZZY SR., Why didn't anybody tell me? It was bolted down!,151
18410,IZZY, I still thought you could do it.,151
18411,IZZY JR., Me too.,151
18412,JERRY," Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.",151
18413,IZZY," Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've ruined our business with all your macho head games.",151
18414,JERRY,  I didn't ruin your business.,151
18415,IZZY," Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up.",151
18416,JERRY,  Don't you hire people to do that?,151
18417,IZZY, Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan!,151
18418,JERRY,"  So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?",151
18419,IZZY, Yeah.,151
18420,JERRY,  I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.,151
18421,IZZY SR.,"  Hey, I can't see the TV.",151
18422,JERRY, Here.,151
18423,IZZY," You think you're better than us, don't you?! Huh!?",151
18424,PETERMAN," Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion.",151
18425,ELAINE,"  Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long.  Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already!  Die!!",151
18426,PETERMAN,  Elaine. You don't like the movie?,151
18427,ELAINE,  I hate it!!,151
18428,CROWD, Shh!,151
18429,ELAINE,"  Oh, go to hell!!",151
18430,PETERMAN,"  Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired.",151
18431,ELAINE,  Great. I'll wait for you outside.,151
18432,JERRY, He was gonna fire you?,151
18433,ELAINE, The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.,151
18434,JERRY, Tunisia?,151
18435,ELAINE, That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.,151
18436,JERRY," Well, that doesn't sound so bad.",151
18437,ELAINE, I have to live in a cave.,151
18438,JERRY,  Oh. ,151
18439,KRAMER, These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.,151
18440,KRAMER,"  Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?",151
18441,DANIELLE," I'm very happy with George. I'm sorry Neil, it's over.",151
18442,DANIELLE," Come on, let's just eat our crepes.",151
18443,CUSTOMER,  Aaghh!! My face!,151
18444,DANIELLE,  Neil!,151
18445,JERRY, Why are the crepes spraying?,151
18446,KRAMER,"  The Dominicans are rolling them too tight.  Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.",151
18447,GEORGE, Danielle. Where's Neil?  Is this him?,151
18448,DANIELLE," Yeah, that blueberry crepe burned him pretty badly.",151
18449,GEORGE,  Whose cane is this?,151
18450,DANIELLE, It's Neil's.,151
18451,GEORGE,"  A cane. I knew it.  So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut.",151
18452,GEORGE," Well, Danielle,  we should get going. I got a key made for you.",151
18453,DANIELLE," George, I can't move in with you.",151
18454,GEORGE,  What?,151
18455,DANIELLE," I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil to a clinic in England.",151
18456,GEORGE,"  N..no, no. You can't leave me.  Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!",151

18735,STEINBRENNER," What's that figure ahead? Is that anything? Okay, let's check the desk. That's where I heard the ticking. Search each one of those drawers starting with the top one. So, empty calories and male curiosity, eh, Georgie?",152
18736,BOMB COP, Looks like there's more compartments underneath.,152
18737,STEINBRENNER," Compartments underneath, that's probably where it is. Okay boys, let 'er rip. I'll tell you what George. Starting tomorrow no more desks. Just Lucite tables and four leSTEINBRENNER.",152
18738,KRAMER," Hey, watch where you're kicking!",152
18739,ELAINE, Kramer.,152

18742,KRAMER, Yeah.,152
18743,ELAINE, Yeah.,152
18744,GEORGE," Hi Connie, Jerry around?",152
18745,CONRAD," No, and I prefer ""Conrad"". So I heard what happened to the desk.",152
18746,GEORGE, There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.,152
18747,CONRAD," Yeah, well, whatever. See ya'",152
18748,JERRY," Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!",152
18749,GEORGE," So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.",153
18750,MARCY, Why?,153
18751,GEORGE, I was naked.,153
18752,MARCY," Oh, George.",153
18753,JERRY, I saw it.,153
18754,MARCY, How'd he look?,153
18755,JERRY, Okay. I wouldn't see it again.,153
18756,MARCY," You know, a friend of mine thought she got Legonare's disease in the hot tub.",153
18757,GEORGE, Really? What happened?,153
18758,MARCY," Oh, yada yada yada, just some bad egg salad. I'll be right back. ",153
18759,JERRY," I noticed she's big on the phrase ""yada yada.""",153
18760,GEORGE," Is ""yada yada"" bad?",153
18761,JERRY," No, ""yada yada"" is good. She's very succinct.",153
18762,GEORGE, She is succinct.,153
18763,JERRY," Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. ",153
18764,GEORGE, Hey.,153
18765,JERRY," Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley.",153
18766,GEORGE," Yeah, dentist of the stars.",153
18767,JERRY, What's up?,153
18768,TIM, I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.,153
18769,JERRY, Excuse me?,153
18770,TIM, I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.,153
18771,JERRY, Well...  Welcome aboard.,153
18772,TIM, Thanks.,153
18773,GEORGE," Hey, where you just at the health club?",153
18774,TIM," Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. ",153
18775,JERRY," Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.",153
18776,ELAINE," So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.",153
18777,JERRY, Booze is not a religion.,153
18778,ELAINE," Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.",153
18779,JERRY," Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.",153
18780,ELAINE, What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.,153
18781,JERRY, I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.,153
18782,ELAINE," Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. ",153
18783,KRAMER," Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?",153
18784,MICKEY," We're double dating tonight, and if we wear the same shirt we'll look like idiots.",153
18785,ELAINE," Hmm, turn around.  Both so striking.",153
18786,KRAMER, Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.,153
18787,ELAINE, How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? ,153
18788,MARCY," So I'm on 3rd Avenue, mindin' my own business, and, yada yada yada, I get a free massage and a facial.",153
18789,GEORGE, What a succinct story.,153
18790,MARCY, I'm surprised you drive a Cadillac.,153
18791,GEORGE," Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's.",153
18792,MARCY, Are you close with your parents?,153
18793,GEORGE," Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...",153
18794,MARCY, Yada what?,153
18795,GEORGE, Yada yada yada...,153
18796,KAREN,  I like your shirt.,153
18797,MICKEY," Oh, thank you. It's 100 cotton, and some wool.",153
18798,KRAMER," Well, you too seem to have the same taste.",153
18799,JULIE," Well I like it, too.",153
18800,KRAMER, Well I have the same shirt.,153
18801,MICKEY," Yeah, well I'm wearin' it.",153
18802,JULIE, I like your shirt too.,153
18803,KAREN," Oh, so do I.",153
18804,KRAMER, Oh. ,153
18805,WAITER," Anything to drink? Some wine, perhaps.",153
18806,MICKEY, I like Merlot.,153
18807,KAREN, I love Merlot.,153
18808,JULIE, I'm crazy about Merlot.,153
18809,KRAMER, I live for Merlot.,153
18810,WAITER, We're out of Merlot.,153
18811,AGENT," So you, uh, know Betha and Arnie pretty well?",153
18812,ELAINE," Oh, yeah, yeah.",153
18813,AGENT, Do you socialize with them often?,153
18814,ELAINE," Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.",153
18815,AGENT, Oh.,153
18816,ELAINE," Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, ""Would you SHUT UP?!"" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. ",153
18817,GEORGE," Oh, you're in here.",153
18818,JERRY, What're you doing here?,153
18819,GEORGE, I knew you had an appointment.,153
18820,JERRY, Well this is very awkward.,153
18821,GEORGE," I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. ",153
18822,JERRY," Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.",153
18823,GEORGE," Hey, what this thing? Whew!",153
18824,JERRY," All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. ",153
18825,GEORGE," Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?",153
18826,JERRY, George...,153
18827,TIM, Um...,153
18828,GEORGE," Fine, I'll make an appointment. ",153
18829,TIM," All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh?",153
18830,JERRY, Hey.,153
18831,TIM, Those aren't mahtzah balls.,153
18832,JERRY," Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?",153
18833,TIM," Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?",153
18834,JERRY," I know, but...",153
18835,TIM," Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years.",153
18836,JERRY, 5000.,153
18837,TIM," 5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride.",153
18838,JERRY, And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.,153
18839,ELAINE, Why are you so concerned about this?,153
18840,JERRY, I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. ,153
18841,PHONE, Would you be interested in a subscription to the New York Times?,153
18842,JERRY, Yes. ,153
18843,KRAMER, I don't believe that.,153
18844,MICKEY, If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've figured this whole thing out.,153
18845,KRAMER, Why were you holding the door open for?,153
18846,MICKEY, Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man?,153
18847,KRAMER," Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!",153
18848,MICKEY, Let's just put they're names in a hat.,153
18849,KRAMER," I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?",153
18850,MICKEY, I'm not sure she was my type.,153
18851,KRAMER," Oh, everybody's your type.",153
18852,MICKEY, What the hell does that mean?,153
18853,KRAMER, You've been married three times.,153
18854,MICKEY," That's it, it's go time! ",153
18855,JERRY," All right, take it easy.",153
18856,ELAINE," Hey, hey, hey!",153
18857,KRAMER," Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!",153
18858,ELAINE," Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.",153
18859,MICKEY, That's not bad.,153
18860,KRAMER," All right, so we let the girls decide.",153
18861,MICKEY," Yeah, why should we knock ourselves out?",153
18862,KRAMER," Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.",153
18863,MICKEY," No, no one wears the shirt next time.",153
18864,KRAMER," That's right, 'cause they already saw it.",153
18865,MICKEY, We'll look like idiots. ,153
18866,GEORGE," Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.",153
18867,MARCY, So what's she doing now?,153
18868,GEORGE, Yada.,153
18869,MARCY," Speaking of ex's, my old boyfriend came over late last night, and, yada yada yada, anyway. I'm really tired today.",153
18870,ELAINE," Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?",153
18871,ARNIE, Well our adoption application was denied.,153
18872,ELAINE, Really.,153
18873,BETH, The adoption agent seems to feel that Arnie has a violent temper.,153
18874,ELAINE, Oh.,153
18875,BETH, So we're just asking our friends what they may have said to the adoption agent.,153
18876,ELAINE," Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.",153
18877,JERRY, How you doing?,153
18878,FATHER, I have a discomfort in my molar. ,153
18879,TIM," Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in?  Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. ",153
18880,JERRY, Whatley. ,153
18881,KRAMER, What are they doing here?,153
18882,MICKEY, I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early.,153
18883,KRAMER," All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?",153
18884,MICKEY," All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one do you want?",153
18885,KRAMER," All right, I'll take Julie.",153
18886,MICKEY, I knew you wanted her. That's who I wanted.,153
18887,KRAMER," All right, I'll take Karen.",153
18888,MICKEY," No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen.",153
18889,KRAMER," All right, which one is Julie?  Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. ",153
18890,JERRY," So Whatley sayd to me, ""Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic.""",153
18891,ELAINE," You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys.  Bouys!",153
18892,JERRY," Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.",153
18893,ELAINE, So what're you gonna do?,153
18894,JERRY, I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.,153
18895,ELAINE,"  Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.",153
18896,JERRY, They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?,153
18897,ELAINE, Thought it would be nice.,153
18898,JERRY, Poor Beth.,153
18899,ELAINE," Hey, Arnie's just as upset.",153
18900,JERRY, Oh screw him! ,153
18901,GEORGE," Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and ""yada yada yada, I'm really tired today."" You don't think she yada yada'd sex.",153
18902,ELAINE,  I've yada yada'd sex.,153
18903,GEORGE, Really?,153
18904,ELAINE," Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.",153
18905,JERRY, But you yada yada'd over the best part.,153
18906,ELAINE," No, I mentioned the bisk.",153
18907,GEORGE," Well, I gotta do somethin'. ",153
18908,KRAMER," Well, I gotta do somethin'.",153
18909,JERRY, George is already in there.,153
18910,KRAMER,"  No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.",153
18911,JERRY, I thought you were leaning towards Julie.,153
18912,KRAMER," I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.",153
18913,GEORGE, Well it was a helluva yada yada.,153
18914,MARCY," He's moving to Seattle. We wanted to say goodbye, I was just getting out of the shower, and yada yada yada--",153
18915,GEORGE," All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.",153
18916,MARCY, Okay.,153
18917,GEORGE, Tell me about the free facial.,153
18918,MARCY," Okay, well, like I said I was on 3rd Avenue, and I stopped by a large department store.",153
18919,GEORGE, Which one?,153
18920,MARCY, Bloomingdale's.,153
18921,GEORGE, Very good. Go on.,153
18922,MARCY," Oh, and I stole a Piaget watch.",153
18923,GEORGE, What's that?,153
18924,MARCY," And then, I was on such a... high, that I went upstairs to the salon on the fifth floor, and got a massage and facial, and skipped out on the bill.",153
18925,GEORGE, Shoplifting.,153
18926,MARCY," Well, what about you? You told me that you were engaged. What was the rest of that? ",153
18927,JERRY," Excuse me, Mother?",153
18928,NUN, Sister.,153
18929,JERRY," Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?",153
18930,NUN, Well not until tomorrow.,153
18931,JERRY," Hmm, I really need to speak with him.",153
18932,FATHER, That's a kneeler.,153
18933,JERRY, Oh. ,153
18934,FATHER," Tell me your sins, my son.",153
18935,JERRY, Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.,153
18936,FATHER, That's no sin.,153
18937,JERRY," Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.",153
18938,FATHER, And this offends you as a Jewish person.,153
18939,JERRY," No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.",153
18940,FATHER, Well.,153
18941,JERRY," And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.",153
18942,FATHER, I haven't heard that one.,153
18943,JERRY," Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, ""Those aren't buoys.""  Father...",153
18944,FATHER," One second... Well, if it would make you feel better I could speak to Dr. Whatley. I have to go back and have a wisdom teeth removed.",153
18945,JERRY, You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?,153
18946,FATHER, Um...,153
18947,JERRY, Newer magazines.,153
18948,FATHER, Now if you'll excuse me. ,153
18949,GEORGE," Jerry, I gotta talk to you.",153
18950,KRAMER, Hi.,153
18951,KAREN," Hi, Kramer.",153
18952,KRAMER, Got a minute?,153
18953,KAREN," Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to meet them?",153
18954,KRAMER, Sure.,153
18955,KAREN,"  Mom, Dad.",153
18956,KRAMER, Hi.,153
18957,ARNIE," Elaine, I have to ask you something. What exactly happened down there?",153
18958,ELAINE," Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....",153
18959,ARNIE," All right, shut up!",153
18960,ELAINE, Again you are telling me to shut up?,153
18961,ARNIE, What?,153
18962,ELAINE, You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.,153
18963,ARNIE, Oh my God. How am I gonna tell Beth?,153
18964,ELAINE," Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.",153
18965,ARNIE," All right, just don't screw it up this time! ",153
18966,ELAINE," See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.",153
18967,JERRY,"  Oh, are you about done?",153
18968,TIM, I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines.,153
18969,JERRY, Huh?,153
18970,TIM, Father Curtis told me about your little joke.,153
18971,JERRY, What about all your Jewish jokes?,153
18972,TIM," I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through.",153
18973,JERRY, The Jews?,153
18974,TIM," No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?",153
18975,JERRY, Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?,153
18976,KRAMER," So, I'll uh... all right. ",153
18977,JERRY, Date with Karen?,153
18978,KRAMER," No, Julie. She's the one.",153
18979,JERRY, What happened to Karen?,153
18980,KRAMER," Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?",153
18981,JERRY," Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?",153
18982,KRAMER," Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.",153
18983,JERRY, So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.,153
18984,KRAMER," Those people, listen to yourself.",153
18985,JERRY, What?,153
18986,KRAMER," You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.",153
18987,JERRY," Kramer, he's just a dentist.",153
18988,KRAMER," Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.",153
18989,JERRY, I am not an anti-dentite!,153
18990,KRAMER," You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. ""Hey, denty!"" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.",153
18991,JERRY, They do have their own schools!,153
18992,KRAMER, Yeah!,153
18993,ELAINE," One little baby, whatever you have in stock.",153
18994,AENT, Miss Benes...,153
18995,ELAINE," Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.",153
18996,BETH," Jerry, I'm sorry to bother you, but you always said you'd be there for me.",153
18997,JERRY," Well, what's wrong?",153
18998,BETH, I'm thinking of leaving Arnie.,153
18999,JERRY, Talk to me.,153
19000,BETH," He met with Elaine, and I asked him what happened, and he yada yada'd me. I mean, could he be having an affair?",153
19001,JERRY," Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.",153
19002,BETH, But we just got married.,153
19003,JERRY, Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.,153
19004,BETH, Why would Elaine do that to me?,153
19005,JERRY," Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. ",153
19006,MICKEY, Hey Jerry. Where's Kramer? I've got exciting news.,153
19007,JERRY, I'm kinda in the middle of something.,153

19045,ELAINE," Uhm, I just have a question.",154
19046,GLADYS,"  I know, the margaritas in that place are so strong.",154
19047,ELAINE,  Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.,154

19052,VALERIE, Ready to go? I don't wanna miss the previews.,154
19053,JERRY," Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up. Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.",154
19054,VALERIE," I think that I was in that theatre. That, that was really funny.",154
19055,JERRY," Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.",154

19058,GEORGE, What number?,154
19059,JERRY, Seven.,154
19060,GEORGE," Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen.",154
19061,KRAMER," Uh, hey buddy.",154
19062,JERRY, Hey.,154
19063,KRAMER, It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.,154
19064,JERRY, You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!,154
19065,KRAMER," No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.",154
19066,JERRY," Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!",154
19067,KRAMER, You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.,154
19068,GEORGE," Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.",154
19069,JERRY, What for?,154
19070,GEORGE,"  I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.",154
19071,JERRY," Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?",154
19072,GEORGE,  I have no idea.,154
19073,ELAINE," Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.",154
19074,JERRY, I don't mind the Mayans.,154
19075,ELAINE,"  You know that store, Putumayo?  I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.",154
19076,KRAMER," What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.",154
19077,ELAINE," No, no, not Putumayo.",154
19078,KRAMER," No, no. Cinqo de Mayo.  Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.",154
19079,GEORGE,"  You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch.",154
19080,ELAINE, What'd you have?,154
19081,KRAMER," Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. ",154
19082,JERRY," Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!",154
19083,KRAMER,"  Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons.",154
19084,MINKLER," George, we'll be blunt. The Mets need somebody to head up scouting, and we think that someone might be you.",154
19085,GEORGE,  Head of scouting?,154
19086,MOONEY, Interested?,154
19087,GEORGE,  I'm still here.,154
19088,MINKLER," Now, unfortunately, league rules prevent us from making you an offer while you're still under contract.",154
19089,MOONEY, You understand what we're talking about?,154
19090,GEORGE, So you're talking...,154
19091,MINKLER," No, no.",154
19092,MOONEY," We're *not* talking. We're just, talking.",154
19093,GEORGE," So, you need me to get fired.",154
19094,MINKLER, We didn't say that.,154
19095,MOONEY," We couldn't say that, because even if we did...",154
19096,MINKLER, ...we couldn't say that we said it.,154
19097,MOONEY, You see what we're saying?,154
19098,GEORGE,  You are still paying for this lunch?,154
19099,MINKLER,  We didn't say that.,154
19100,JERRY, Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?,154
19101,VALERIE,  Someplace nice this time?,154
19102,JERRY," Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.",154
19103,VALERIE,"  I don't know, got a two in Zagat's.",154
19104,JERRY, Lemme just check my messages.  Maybe a nicer girl called.,154
19105,VOICE , Hello?,154
19106,JERRY, Hello? Who's this?,154
19107,VOICE , Jane. What number did you dial?,154
19108,JERRY, Seven?,154
19109,ELAINE," Hey! See these?  Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! ",154
19110,GEORGE ,  Meet the Mets...,154
19111,GEORGE, ...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.,154
19112,JERRY, Good meeting?,154
19113,GEORGE," There was no meeting.  But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.",154
19114,JERRY, You can do that.,154
19115,GEORGE," Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'",154
19116,JERRY, So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?,154
19117,GEORGE, Ehh.  Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?,154
19118,KRAMER, You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?,154
19119,JERRY," So, George...",154
19120,GEORGE, Yeah.,154
19121,JERRY,"  I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.",154
19122,GEORGE, So?,154
19123,JERRY, So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.,154
19124,GEORGE," What, she's ranking you?",154
19125,JERRY," Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer.",154
19126,GEORGE, What is a barometer exactly?,154
19127,KRAMER, It's pronounced thermometer.,154
19128,KRAMER," You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup  getting a call here.",154
19129,KRAMER,"  Hey, it's Newman.  Hey, how you doing, Newman?",154
19130,KRAMER,"  Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?",154
19131,VALERIE,"  Oh, flowers. You didn't have to do that. I mean, the dinner, and the play, and the hansom cab ride.",154
19132,JERRY," Well, I just wanted to...  You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.",154
19133,VALERIE, Oh.,154
19134,JERRY,"  ...you know, make a good impression.",154
19135,VALERIE, I'm gonna go put these in some water.,154
19136,JERRY, I like the way you think.,154
19137,JERRY," Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!",154
19138,GEORGE," Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.",154
19139,WILHELM, Isn't that Babe Ruth's uniform?,154
19140,GEORGE, Is it? ,154
19141,GEORGE," Huh, strawberries, anyone?  Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.",154
19142,GEORGE, Gotta get the good ones.,154
19143,GEORGE," Oh, that's bad. That's bad.",154
19144,KRAMER," So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?",154
19145,JERRY, Some of us.,154
19146,KRAMER,  I don't wanna exclude anybody.,154
19147,JERRY, Hola.,154
19148,ELAINE, Shove it!,154
19149,JERRY, What is all this?,154
19150,ELAINE," I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing  and strutting in front of their store for two days.",154
19151,JERRY," Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.",154
19152,KRAMER," Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.",154
19153,ELAINE," Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.",154
19154,KRAMER, Newman?,154
19155,ELAINE, Yeah.,154
19156,KRAMER,"  Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!",154
19157,JERRY, Hi Valerie.,154
19158,JERRY, You're not Valerie.,154
19159,MRS HAMILTON, I'm her step-mother. Drive.,154
19160,MRS HAMILTON," It's taken me thirteen years to climb up to the top of that speed-dial, and I don't intend to lose my spot to you.",154
19161,JERRY," But, I never...",154
19162,MRS HAMILTON,  You just stay away from that phone.,154
19163,GEORGE," You wanted to see me, sir?",154
19164,STEINBRENNER, I heard about what happened at the meeting this morning...,154
19165,GEORGE," Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.",154
19166,STEINBRENNER," ...and I have to tell you, it's exactly what this organisation needed.",154
19167,STEINBRENNER," We wanna look to the future, we gotta tear down the past. Babe Ruth was nothing more than a fat old man, with little-girl legs. And here's something I just found out recently. He wasn't really a sultan. Ah, what d'you make of that? Hey, check this out.  Lou Gehrig's pants. Not a bad fit.  Hey, you don't think that nerve disease of his was contagious, do you? Uh, I better take 'em off. I'm too important to this team.  Big Stein can't be flopping and twitching.",154
19168,STEINBRENNER," Hey, how 'bout some lunch. What're you going for?",154
19169,JERRY," You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.",154
19170,VALERIE, You deserve it.,154
19171,JERRY," But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.",154
19172,VALERIE," My stepmother got to you, didn't she?",154
19173,JERRY, What? No.,154
19174,VALERIE," Uuh, I can't believe she did this again. That's it! She's off the speed-dial completely!",154
19175,JERRY, Yikes!,154
19176,KRAMER," Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.",154
19177,NEWMAN," You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.",154
19178,KRAMER,"  You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!",154
19179,NEWMAN, I have done nothing unethical.,154
19180,KRAMER," Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.",154
19181,NEWMAN," Cancel!  Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.",154
19182,KRAMER,"  Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.",154
19183,NEWMAN,  What kind?,154
19184,KRAMER, Cubed.,154
19185,NEWMAN," That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.",154
19186,KRAMER, I gotta invite Jerry. He's my buddy.,154
19187,NEWMAN," That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!",154
19188,JERRY, How could they not fire you?,154
19189,GEORGE, Never thought I'd fail at failing.,154
19190,JERRY," Aw, come on there now.",154
19191,GEORGE,  Feel like I can't do anything wrong.,154
19192,JERRY, Nonsense. You do everything wrong.,154
19193,GEORGE,  Everything?,154
19194,JERRY, Everything.,154
19195,GEORGE, You really think so?,154
19196,JERRY, Absolutely. I have no confidence in you.,154
19197,GEORGE," Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!",154
19198,JERRY, That's the spirit. You suck!,154
19199,GEORGE,  I know.,154
19200,ELAINE," No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.",154
19201,GLADYS, Do you need some help with something?,154
19202,ELAINE,  You? What're you doing here?,154
19203,GLADYS, I own this store.,154
19204,ELAINE, No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. ,154
19205,GLADYS, I'm Gladys Mayo.,154
19206,ELAINE," Ah, this really sticks in my craw.",154
19207,JERRY," Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?",154
19208,MRS HAMILTON," I'm sure she'll be along.  Have some wine, Jerome.",154
19209,JERRY, Okay.,154
19210,MRS HAMILTON," You know Jerome, I can understand what Valerie sees in you. So attractive, so strong, so comedic.",154
19211,JERRY," Uh, good.",154
19212,MRS HAMILTON," Jerome, I have a deliciously naughty idea.",154
19213,JERRY,  What?,154
19214,MRS HAMILTON, Why don't I put you on my speed-dial?,154
19215,JERRY," I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...",154
19216,MRS HAMILTON," Don't be such a child, Jerome. How's number three sound?",154
19217,JERRY," Valerie's not coming over, is she?",154
19218,MRS HAMILTON," Seven, four...",154
19219,JERRY, No...,154
19220,MRS HAMILTON, Two...,154
19221,JERRY," Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?",154
19222,MRS HAMILTON, I won't tell if you don't.,154
19223,JERRY,  Wuhh...,154
19224,KRAMER, Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand...,154
19225,KRAMER,  Newmanniun!!,154
19226,KRAMER,  Jerry?,154
19227,KOREN ," Alright, Yankees, two. Orioles, nothing. Wait a minute! A short stocky bald man is streaking across the field.",154
19228,JERRY," Oh my God, George!",154
19229,KOREN ," Check that. He's not streaking. He's wearing a flesh-tone body-stocking. Apparently, he's a bit bashful, and oddly, no-one seems upset.",154
19230,JERRY," Kramer, look, it's George.",154
19231,KOREN , Everyone loves him.,154
19232,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, I know.  Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.",154
19233,JERRY,  Fine.,154
19234,KRAMER,"  I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!",154
19235,JERRY,  No problem.,154
19236,KRAMER,"  You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.",154
19237,KRAMER,"  Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.",154
19238,ELAINE,  Okay.,154
19239,KRAMER," No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.",154
19240,ELAINE,  Fine.,154
19241,KRAMER,  Oh come on!!,154
19242,ELAINE,  Alright.,154
19243,KRAMER,"  Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh.  Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.",154
19244,ELAINE,"  Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?",154
19245,KRAMER, Yeah.,154
19246,ELAINE," Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.",154
19247,KRAMER, Can do.,154
19248,JERRY, What're you doing with a pricing-gun?,154
19249,ELAINE, That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.,154
19250,JERRY,  Still a rip-off.,154
19251,JERRY, Hello?,154
19252,VALERIE," Jerry, I was just at my stepmom's house, and I saw that you were on her speed-dial.",154
19253,JERRY," Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.",154
19254,JERRY, Hold on a second.,154
19255,JERRY, Hello?,154
19256,MRS HAMILTON,  Hi Jerome.,154
19257,JERRY," Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.",154
19258,JERRY, Hello?,154
19259,VALERIE," That's her on the other line, isn't it?",154
19260,JERRY, Well...,154
19261,VALERIE, Tell her I don't want you on her speed-dial.,154
19262,JERRY, Hang on.,154
19263,JERRY," She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.",154
19264,MRS HAMILTON," I won't, until she puts me back on hers.",154
19265,JERRY, Hang on.,154
19266,JERRY, She wants to be back on yours.,154
19267,VALERIE, Fine. But only if you're off hers.,154
19268,JERRY, Hang on.,154
19269,JERRY," Fine, if I'm off yours.",154
19270,VALERIE," No, still me.",154
19271,JERRY, Sorry. Hang on.,154
19272,JERRY," Fine, if I'm off yours.",154
19273,MRS HAMILTON," I won't do it. It's my speed-dial, and I don't trust her.",154
19274,JERRY," Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.",154
19275,MRS HAMILTON,  Alright. I'll hide you in one of the emergency buttons.,154
19276,JERRY,"  Great, bye.",154
19277,JERRY, She said she'll do it.,154
19278,VALERIE, Great.,154

19283,FAN,"  Hey, body-suit man.",154
19284,KRAMER," Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty.",154
19285,GLADYS," Well, lemme show you what we have.",154
19286,KRAMER," Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.",154
19287,KRAMER,"  Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?",154
19288,GLADYS, Yeah.,154
19289,KRAMER, Hmm-mmm.,154
19290,GLADYS, Some of those are women's clothes.,154
19291,KRAMER," Oh, not a problem.",154
19292,GEORGE," Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.",154
19293,KRAMER, L'Occupado.,154
19294,ELAINE," Come on, what is taking you so long?",154
19295,KRAMER," Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.",154
19296,ELAINE, Plan B? There is no plan B.,154
19297,KRAMER,  I took these out of every single garment in the store.,154
19298,ELAINE, What?!,154
19299,KRAMER," They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture.  These clothes won't last five years without 'em.",154
19300,ELAINE, That's not gonna do anything.,154
19301,KRAMER, Patience.,154
19302,ELAINE, Alright. Forget it!,154
19303,KRAMER, What?,154
19304,ELAINE," You have screwed me again, Pennypacker!",154
19305,GLADYS," Ladies, care for some chips?",154
19306,KRAMER,"  Well, I don't mind if I do.",154
19307,KRAMER," Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.",154
19308,STEINBRENNER," I heard what you did in the parking lot, big boy, and it is in-excuse-a-bull. You personally insulted me, my staff... I cannot believe that you, body-suit man, could perpetrate such a disloyalty. Breaks my heart to say it... Oh, who am I kidding? I love it. You're fi...",154
19309,WILHELM," Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to blame here, it's me.",154
19310,STEINBRENNER," What're you talking about, Wilhelm. You popping pills? You got the crazies again?",154
19311,WILHELM," No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games.",154
19312,GEORGE,"  He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!",154
19313,STEINBRENNER, Macho head games?,154
19314,WILHELM,"  He's just being loyal to me, sir.",154
19315,STEINBRENNER," Wilhelm, you're fired. I owe you an apology, body-suit man. Streak on.  Now, if you gentlemen'll excuse me, I'm not going to the game today, I'm gonna go outside and scalp some tickets.  Owner's box, that's gotta bring in forty bucks, no problem.",154
19316,GEORGE," Mr Wilhelm, what was that?!",154
19317,WILHELM," I wanted to get fired. George, you are looking at the new head scout of the New York Mets.",154
19318,WILHELM,"  Meet the Mets, meet the Mets. Come right out and greet the Mets.",154
19319,KRAMER," I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.",154
19320,JERRY, She never sees the big picture.,154
19321,JERRY," Hello, Newman!",154
19322,NEWMAN, Hello Jerry.  What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.,154
19323,KRAMER," Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.",154
19324,NEWMAN," Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime.",154
19325,KRAMER," Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.",154
19326,NEWMAN," Alright. Come back to my party, please.",154
19327,KRAMER," Jerry too, of course.",154
19328,NEWMAN,"  You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?",154
19329,JERRY, No.,154
19330,NEWMAN," Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a  lot of Elaine.",154
19331,KRAMER, Deal?,154
19332,NEWMAN, To the Newmanniun! ,154
19333,KRAMER,  To the Kramennium.,154
19334,JERRY," By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?",154
19335,NEWMAN,"  As a matter of fact, I did.",154
19336,JERRY," Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.",154
19337,JERRY, Aww!,154
19338,MRS HAMILTON, I don't feel well at all. I feel all dried-out inside.,154
19339,VALERIE, I'll call for help.,154
19340,JERRY, Hello?,154
19341,VALERIE, Who's this?,154
19342,JERRY, It's Jerry. Who's this?,154
19343,VALERIE," Uh, it's Valerie.",154
19344,JERRY," Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?",154
19345,VALERIE," I'll tell you what's up. My stepmother is violently ill, so I hit the button for poison control and I get you!",154
19346,JERRY," Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!",154
19347,JERRY, Hello?,154
19348,JERRY, Hang on just let me pick up a paper.,155
19349,MAN, Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?,155
19350,GEORGE, Yeah. No problem.,155
19351,JERRY, Let's go.,155
19352,GEORGE," Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag.",155
19353,JERRY, For how long?,155
19354,GEORGE, I'm sure he'll be back in a second.,155
19355,JERRY, Come on.,155
19356,GEORGE, Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?,155
19357,GEORGE, Where are you going?,155
19358,JERRY, I'm going to be this guy's friend.,155
19359,JERRY, New clothes?,155
19360,GEORGE, Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping.  Can I borrow your menu?,155
19361,JERRY," Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!",155
19362,GEORGE, The guy never came back.,155
19363,JERRY, He asked you to watch them not wear them.,155
19364,GEORGE, I'm still watching them.,155
19365,JERRY, You look like a tourist.,155
19366,GEORGE," All right, let me ask you something",155
19367,JERRY, When you hear like a soft russeling.,155
19368,GEORGE," It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this",155
19369,JERRY," Oh right, the new job, how is it?",155
19370,GEORGE," I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.",155
19371,JERRY, So who's the new you?,155
19372,GEORGE, They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.,155
19373,JERRY, Oh hi Alex.,155
19374,ALEX, I'm sorry I'm late. Have you ordered yet?,155
19375,JERRY, No.,155
19376,ALEX, I'll be right back.,155
19377,GEORGE, Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?,155
19378,JERRY," Right here, George. In here.  Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.",155
19379,GEORGE, Thanks. Thanks a lot.,155
19380,KRAMER, Hey.,155
19381,ELAINE, Hey.,155
19382,KRAMER, Hi.,155
19383,ELAINE, Where's Jerry?,155
19384,KRAMER, Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?,155
19385,ELAINE, No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.,155
19386,KRAMER, Well let's sit down.,155
19387,ELAINE," Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?",155
19388,KRAMER, Vaguely.,155
19389,ELAINE," Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.",155
19390,KRAMER, You put my life's stories in his autobiography?,155
19391,ELAINE," Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.",155
19392,KRAMER," Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.",155
19393,ELAINE, He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.,155
19394,KRAMER, Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh.,155
19395,KRAMER," He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks.",155
19396,JERRY,  Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.,155
19397,KRAMER," All right, let's go.",155
19398,ELAINE," Mr. Lippman, how are you?",155
19399,MR. LIPPMAN, Well I'm not bad. Not bad.,155
19400,ELAINE, What are you doing here?,155
19401,MR. LIPPMAN, I work for Pundant Publishishing. This is our book.,155
19402,ELAINE, Oh.,155
19403,MR. LIPPMAN, If you can call it that. Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star has his own book out now?,155
19404,KRAMER, Hey buddy. Remember me?,155
19405,MR. PETERMAN, You're that gangly fellow we bought the stories from.,155
19406,KRAMER," Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?",155
19407,WOMAN, Who are you?,155
19408,KRAMER, I'm the real Peterman.,155
19409,MR. PETERMAN, All right playtime's over.,155
19410,KRAMER, Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.,155
19411,WOMAN, I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.,155
19412,ELAINE, That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.,155
19413,MR. LIPPMAN, So you just eat the tops.,155
19414,ELAINE," Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of  does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.",155
19415,KRAMER, I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.,155
19416,MARY ANNE, Please don't think all New Yorkers are so rude.,155
19417,GEORGE, Well actually I'm...,155
19418,MARY ANNE, I'm Mary Anne. I work for the New York Visitor's Center. Where are you visiting from?,155
19419,GEORGE," Little Rock, Arkensas.",155
19420,MARY ANNE, Ooh.,155
19421,JERRY, Hmm. That looks new.,155
19422,KRAMER, So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.,155
19423,JERRY,  Yeah that's too bad.,155
19424,KRAMER, What's the matter with you?,155
19425,JERRY,  Nothing.,155
19426,KRAMER," No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.",155
19427,JERRY, I did something stupid.,155
19428,KRAMER, What did you do?,155
19429,JERRY," Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew,  Gone.",155
19430,KRAMER, Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.,155
19431,JERRY, Well women do it.,155
19432,KRAMER,"  ""Well women do it."" I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just  sashey your pretty little self around the town square.",155
19433,JERRY, Well what am I going to tell Alex?,155
19434,KRAMER, Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?,155
19435,JERRY, Um hum.,155
19436,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry shaved his chest.",155
19437,JERRY, Hey!,155
19438,KRAMER, I forgot. Wait. Never mind.,155
19439,ALEX, How about the beach this weekend?,155
19440,JERRY, You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...,155
19441,ALEX," All right. All right. Wow is that a Mexican Hairless? Oh, I love those. Ooh, Hairless. This is where it's at. It's so much smoother and cleaner.",155
19442,JERRY, Really?,155
19443,ELAINE," ""Top of the Muffin to you!""?",155
19444,MR. LIPPMAN, Top of the muffin to you. Elaine!,155
19445,ELAINE, Mr Lippman?,155
19446,JERRY, So you're pretending to be a tourist?,155
19447,GEORGE," It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup",155
19448,JERRY, How do you explain your apartment?,155
19449,GEORGE, I got a hotel room.,155
19450,JERRY, you moved into a hotel?,155
19451,GEORGE, Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?,155
19452,JERRY, So get this,155
19453,GEORGE, So?,155
19454,JERRY, So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.,155
19455,GEORGE, Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?,155
19456,JERRY, Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.,155
19457,KRAMER,  Hey Jerry.,155
19458,KRAMER,  I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.,155
19459,GEORGE, Reality tour?,155
19460,JERRY, The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.,155
19461,ELAINE, This was my idea you stole my idea.,155
19462,MR. LIPPMAN, Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air.,155
19463,ELAINE, Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.,155
19464,MR. LIPPMAN, You want a muffin or not?,155
19465,ELAINE, Peach.,155
19466,MARY ANNE, So I notice you don't have much of an accent.,155
19467,GEORGE, Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.,155
19468,MARY ANNE," Look george, I'm really enjoying spending time with you but I'm not sure this is going to work out. At some point you're going back to your job at Tyler Chicken and your three-legged dog Willie.",155
19469,GEORGE, Willie. Yeah.,155
19470,MARY ANNE, And I'm still going to be here.,155
19471,GEORGE, Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?,155
19472,MARY ANNE,"  George, no offense. But this city would eat you alive.",155
19473,JERRY, You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.,155
19474,GEORGE," Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.",155
19475,JERRY, What is it she think you can't do?,155
19476,GEORGE, Find a job. Get an apartment.,155
19477,JERRY, How did you do those things?,155
19478,GEORGE," Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.",155
19479,JERRY," Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?",155
19480,KRAMER," Here you go, here you go, check it out.",155
19481,JERRY," ""The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour"". I'm confused.",155
19482,KRAMER, Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.,155
19483,JERRY, Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.,155
19484,KRAMER," I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.",155
19485,GEORGE, What's desert?,155
19486,KRAMER, Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.,155
19487,GEORGE, He eats those?,155
19488,KRAMER, No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.,155
19489,GEORGE," I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.",155
19490,KRAMER, Talk to me.,155
19491,GEORGE," But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.",155
19492,KRAMER, Understand?,155
19493,JERRY, Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.,155
19494,MR. LIPPMAN, Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops.,155
19495,ELAINE, So? What do you want me to do about it?,155
19496,MR. LIPPMAN," You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing wrong.",155
19497,ELAINE," Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...",155
19498,MR. LIPPMAN, What if I cut you in for 30% of the profits?,155
19499,ELAINE," Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.",155
19500,MR. LIPPMAN, Ah.  Mmmmm. Ah hah?,155
19501,ELAINE, Yeah.,155
19502,MR. LIPPMAN, So what do we with the bottoms?,155
19503,ELAINE," I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.",155
19504,MR. LIPPMAN, That's a good idea.,155
19505,ELAINE," And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not ""Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*""",155
19506,MR. LIPPMAN, No. No. It is.,155
19507,KRAMER, Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?,155
19508,JERRY, What? Can't I get a moment's peace?,155
19509,KRAMER, What are you doing to yourself?,155
19510,JERRY, I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.,155
19511,KRAMER," You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.",155
19512,JERRY, Oh that's an old wives tale.,155
19513,KRAMER, Is it? Look at this.,155
19514,KRAMER,  Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.,155
19515,JERRY, Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.,155
19516,KRAMER, Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?,155
19517,ELAINE, Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.,155
19518,LIPPMAN," Oh, Rubin, get me another tray of lowfat cranberry.",155
19519,REBECCA," Excuse me, I'm Rebecca Demore from the homeless shelter.",155
19520,ELAINE," Oh, hi.",155
19521,REBECCA, Are you the ones leaveing the muffing pieces behind our shelter?,155
19522,ELAINE, You been enjoying them?,155
19523,REBECCA, They're just stumps.,155
19524,ELAINE, Well they're perfectly edible.,155
19525,REBECCA," Oh, so you just assume that the homeless will eat them, they'll eat anything?",155
19526,MR. LIPPMAN," No no, we just thought...",155
19527,REBECCA," I know what you thought. They don't have homes, they don't have jobs, what do they need the top of a muffin for? They're lucky to get the stumps.",155
19528,ELAINE, If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.,155
19529,REBECCA, The homeless don't like them.,155
19530,ELAINE, Fine.,155
19531,REBECCA," We've never gotten so many complaints. Every two minutes, ""Where is the top of this muffin? Who ate the rest of this?""",155
19532,ELAINE, We were just trying to help.,155
19533,REBECCA, Why don't you just drop off some chicken skins and lobster shells.,155
19534,ELAINE, I think I might.,155
19535,MARY ANNE, I can't believe you found something so quickly. How much you pay?,155
19536,GEORGE, $2300.,155
19537,MARY ANNE, Ouch. A month?,155
19538,GEORGE, Yeah.,155
19539,MARY ANNE," Well, guess that's all right for now, but if you say here for more than a few months, you're a real sucker.",155
19540,GEORGE," Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.",155
19541,MARY ANNE, Yeah. We should let this place air out anyway. It smells like the last tenant had monkeys or something.,155
19542,KRAMER," Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.",155
19543,WOMAN," Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.",155
19544,KRAMER,  Well that's your opinion.,155
19545,KRAMER, Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.,155
19546,KRAMER," Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.",155
19547,JERRY, Why do I have to go on the tour?,155
19548,KRAMER," Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.",155
19549,JERRY," Hey, how's business?",155
19550,ELAINE," Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.",155
19551,KRAMER," All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.",155
19552,ELAINE," Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?",155
19553,KRAMER, Yeah.,155
19554,ELAINE, You got any room on that thing?,155
19555,KRAMER, Yeah there are a few seats still available.,155
19556,ELAINE, Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.,155
19557,KRAMER," Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.",155
19558,ELAINE, No they don't.,155
19559,KRAMER, Are they war veterans?,155
19560,MARY ANNE, Wow this is your office.,155
19561,MR. STEINBRENNER," Woah. Hello. Sorry George, didn't know you got a girl in here. Give me a signal on the doornob like a necktie or a sock or something. Come on George, help me out.",155
19562,MARY ANNE," Mr. Steinbrenner, I would like to thank you for taking a chance on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken like our boy George here.",155
19563,MR. STEINBRENNER, Hen supervisor from Tyler Chicken?,155
19564,GEORGE, Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... ,155
19565,MR. STEINBRENNER, Wait a minute George.,155
19566,GEORGE, Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.,155
19567,MR. STEINBRENNER, Moonlighting for Tyler Chicken. Pretty impressive George. Days with the New York Yankees and nights in Arkensas with a top flight bird outlet. And a hen supervisor to boot. I am blown. Bloooown away. Blown George.  Bloooooooooooooooooooown.,155
19568,ALEX," You know when you make a pizza bagel, you really shouldn't use cinnimon rasin.",155
19569,JERRY, You also shouldn't use a donut.,155
19570,KRAMER, All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...,155
19571,TAPE PLAYER, Turn music off.,155
19572,JERRY, Can we just go?,155
19573,KRAMER, And go we will.,155
19574,MAN, What is this? A piece of pound cake?,155
19575,KRAMER, We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.,155
19576,KRAMER, And we're off.,155
19577,JERRY," You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.",155
19578,MR. STEINBRENNER,  John Tyler? George Steinbreener here. I want to talk about George Castanza. I understand he's been dividing his time between us and you. I cannot have that.,155
19579,JOHN TYLER,  Well I don't know who he is but if you want him that bad I'm not giving him up that easily.,155
19580,MR. STEINBRENNER, Oh is that so. Playing a little hardball huh Jonnyboy?,155
19581,JOHN TYLER," How about this. You give me Castanza, I convert your concessions to all chicken no charge. Instead of hot dogs, chicken dogs. Instead of pretzels, chicken twists. Instead of beer, alcoholic chicken.",155
19582,MR. STEINBRENNER, How do you make that alcoholic chicken?,155
19583,JOHN TYLER," Let if ferment, just like everything else.",155
19584,MR. STEINBRENNER, That stuff sounds great. All right. I'll have Costanza on the next bus.,155
19585,MAN, Hey hey hey hey hey. Where do you think you're going?,155
19586,KRAMER, I was going to dump this.,155
19587,MAN, It doesn't look like garbage.,155
19588,KRAMER, Well it's muffin stumps,155
19589,MAN, Where are the muffin tops?,155
19590,KRAMER, This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.,155
19591,MAN, Can't do it.,155
19592,KRAMER, Is this a joke?,155
19593,MAN, That's what I'd like to know about it.,155
19594,ALEX," You have a pretty heavy beard, don't you?",155
19595,JERRY, What's that?,155
19596,ALEX, Well look it's almost time for you to shave again.,155
19597,JERRY, Oh. Yeah.,155
19598,KRAMER,  Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.,155
19599,MAN, Where are we going?,155
19600,KRAMER,"  I don't know.  Uh, no more questions.",155
19601,WAITRESS," So, the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler chicken.",155
19602,GEORGE," Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.",155
19603,MAN," Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch my clothes?",155
19604,GEORGE, What clothes?,155
19605,MAN, These clothes. The ones you're wearing.,155
19606,JERRY,  Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.,155
19607,KRAMER, Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.,155
19608,JERRY," I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.",155
19609,JERRY, I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.,155
19610,KRAMER, I don't know where the tops are.,155
19611,KRAMER, Jerry what's the matter?,155
19612,JERRY,"  Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.",155
19613,BARTENDER," Hey, you looking for George?",155
19614,MARY ANNE, Yeah.,155
19615,BARTENDER, He's been in the bathroom awhile. You might want to check on him.,155
19616,GEORGE,  Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.,155
19617,MARY ANNE, I told you this city would eat you alive.,155
19618,MR. LIPPMAN, What is this guy again?,155
19619,ELAINE, They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.,155
19620,NEWMAN, Hello Elaine. Where are they?,155
19621,ELAINE, In the back.,155
19622,NEWMAN," All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.",155
19623,MR. LIPPMAN, What is going on here?,155
19624,NEWMAN," If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.",155
19625,JERRY," Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.",156
19626,GEORGE, I got to give the players most of the credit for that.,156
19627,JERRY," Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.",156
19628,GEORGE," No, I don't know who was doing that.",156
19629,JERRY," So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?",156
19630,GEORGE, They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.,156
19631,LANETTE," Here you go. Your latté, your cappuccino.",156
19632,JERRY, Maybe I should ask her out?,156
19633,GEORGE, She is a good waitress.,156
19634,JERRY, That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.,156
19635,GEORGE, You're going to the Tony's?,156
19636,JERRY," Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.",156
19637,GEORGE, Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?',156
19638,JERRY, They're musicians. That's not a joke.,156
19639,GEORGE, It's a funny observation.,156
19640,GEORGE, Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.,156
19641,JERRY, They did it for three years. What's another few months.,156
19642,GEORGE, I'm really going to do something with these three months.,156
19643,JERRY, Like what?,156
19644,GEORGE, I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.,156
19645,JERRY, I've always wanted to do that...,156
19646,GEORGE, I'm gonna play frolf.,156
19647,JERRY, You mean golf?,156
19648,GEORGE," Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this",156
19649,ELAINE, ...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.,156
19650,ELAINE, Who's that?,156
19651,DUGAN," That's Sam, the new girl in the counting.",156
19652,WALTER, What's with her arms? They just hang like salamis.,156
19653,DUGAN, She walks like orangutan.,156
19654,ELAINE, Better call the zoo.,156
19655,DUGAN, Reer...,156
19656,ELAINE, What?,156
19657,WALTER, ssssss...,156
19658,DUGAN, Cat-ty...,156
19659,ELAINE, It's like she's carrying invisible suitcases.,156
19660,JERRY, Like this? ,156
19661,ELAINE," Yes, exactly.",156
19662,JERRY, That's so strange.,156
19663,ELAINE, Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.,156
19664,JERRY," Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?",156
19665,ELAINE, That is so stupid.,156
19666,JERRY, Reer.,156
19667,GEORGE," Hey, 'The White Shadow' is on...",156
19668,JERRY," Boy, your really packing it all in.",156

19671,GEORGE, I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.,156
19672,KRAMER," Hey Jerry, you got any Tums?",156
19673,JERRY, Stomach ache?,156
19674,KRAMER, I drank too much water in the shower.,156
19675,JERRY," Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.",156
19676,GEORGE, Shadow!,156
19677,KRAMER," Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy.",156
19678,ELAINE, You're going to the Tony's too?,156
19679,KRAMER, Roger that.,156
19680,JERRY, Where are you sitting?,156
19681,KRAMER," Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.",156
19682,ELAINE, How did you get that job?,156
19683,KRAMER," Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.",156
19684,JERRY, What academy?,156
19685,KRAMER," Well, he didn't say .",156

19700,MAN, What are you doing?,156
19701,KRAMER, My job. What are you doing?,156
19702,KRAMER," You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.",156
19703,JERRY," So, you and Lyle are roommates?",156
19704,LANETTE, No.,156

19715,MR. GRAHAM,  Thank you and God bless you all. This has truly been a Scarsdale surprise!,156
19716,SAM," Elaine, am I crazy? I just get the feeling that Dugan and the others are making fun of me all the time.",156
19717,ELAINE," Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk.",156
19718,SAM, My arms?,156
19719,ELAINE," You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.",156
19720,SAM, I a caveman?,156
19721,ELAINE," No no no no, it's just...",156
19722,SAM, Everybody told what a catty shrude you are. Your horrible!,156
19723,GEORGE, She had a dude?,156
19724,JERRY," Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.",156
19725,GEORGE, How do you know it was her dude?,156
19726,JERRY, What do you think it could've been just some dude?,156
19727,GEORGE," Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.",156
19728,JERRY, I reckon.,156
19729,GEORGE," Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude.",156
19730,JERRY, Dude!,156
19731,GEORGE," All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap.",156
19732,JERRY, It's 10,156
19733,GEORGE, I tell you; I'm wiped.,156
19734,JERRY," So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?",156
19735,GEORGE, De-compressing.,156
19736,KRAMER," Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you.",156
19737,JERRY, You didn't give that thing back?,156
19738,KRAMER," Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win.",156
19739,JERRY, That's because you didn't win.,156
19740,GEORGE, 'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder.,156
19741,KRAMER, Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch!,156
19742,JERRY, You haven't even seen it.,156
19743,KRAMER," Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's!",156
19744,GEORGE," What, Minelli's!?!",156
19745,KRAMER, No.,156
19746,ELAINE," Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day.",156
19747,SAM," No, don't apologize Elaine. I was thinking that maybe I should swing my arms a little bit more.",156
19748,ELAINE," See, yeah, that's all I was saying.",156
19749,SAM," How's this , or this .",156
19750,ELAINE," Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...",156
19751,JERRY, Hi!,156
19752,LANETTE," Sorry, I'm running late. I just lost track of time.",156
19753,JERRY, No rush.,156
19754,LYLE," Hey, Jerry! What's up?",156
19755,JERRY,  I have absolutely no idea.,156
19756,JERRY, ..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!,156
19757,GEORGE, Who's that?,156
19758,JERRY, It's Kramer.,156
19759,GEORGE, Hey Kramer.,156
19760,JERRY, George says hi.,156
19761,KRAMER,  Hi George!,156
19762,GEORGE, How's that Tony?,156
19763,JERRY, Why don't you just come over?,156
19764,GEORGE, Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now?,156
19765,JERRY, He's looking on to fridgerator.,156
19766,GEORGE, Kramer. Anything good in there? Any Popsicles?,156
19767,JERRY, I can't do this.,156
19768,KRAMER," So, what's George doing?",156
19769,JERRY, He's not doing anything. Goodbye!,156
19770,KRAMER," So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?",156
19771,JERRY, Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?,156
19772,KRAMER, The Tony is taking me to Sardi's.,156
19773,JERRY," Oh, hello.",156

19777,JERRY," All right, all right.",156
19778,JERRY, I said no! ,156
19779,LANETTE," Jerry, I just want to let you know; Lyle and I are completely over. I'd rather be with you.",156
19780,JERRY, Just me? No dudes or fellas?,156

19784,GEORGE,"  Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone.",156
19785,KRAMER, ...so I said to him,156
19786,MR. GRAHAM," Mr. Kramer, my name is Lewis Maxton Graham. I'm one of the producers of 'Scarsdale surprise'.",156
19787,KRAMER," Hey, eh, Lew!",156
19788,MR. GRAHAM, We need to talk.,156
19789,PETERMAN," Elaine, what did you want to talk me about?",156
19790,ELAINE, This. My office. Sam trashed my office.,156
19791,PETERMAN," Well, I see what's going on in here. I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight.",156
19792,ELAINE," Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.",156
19793,PETERMAN, Woof!,156
19794,ELAINE," Do you mean ""reer?""",156
19795,PETERMAN," Yes, that's the one! Good day Elaine. ",156
19796,ELAINE," Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy!  Crazy for feelings...",156
19797,JERRY, I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.,156
19798,LANETTE," Now, what time are you picking me up tonight?",156
19799,JERRY," Eh, what?",156
19800,LANETTE," You got our reservation from Sfuzi's, didn't you?",156
19801,JERRY," Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that.",156
19802,LANETTE, Should I ware the outfit I bought today?,156
19803,JERRY, Sure.,156
19804,LANETTE, Which one?,156
19805,JERRY, The one with the...,156
19806,LANETTE," If I wanna get my hair cut I've gotta go now. Call me when you get home. I wont be there, but leave a message so I know you called.",156
19807,JERRY," Ok, ok...",156
19808,LANETTE, Do you mind?,156
19809,JERRY," No, I'll crab it.",156
19810,GEORGE," Hey, I've done that today.",156
19811,JERRY," What, did you lose your remote?",156
19812,GEORGE," Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead.",156
19813,JERRY, It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.,156
19814,GEORGE,"  Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?",156
19815,JERRY, Not.,156
19816,GEORGE," No, no...",156
19817,JERRY," No, because that's...",156
19818,GEORGE," No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?",156
19819,JERRY, Here.,156
19820,GEORGE, Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.,156
19821,JERRY, I'm trying.,156
19822,GEORGE," I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.",156
19823,JERRY, Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!,156
19824,MR. GRAHAM, I'm sure how excited you are to have this very very prestigious award. But you didn't have anything to do with the actual production.,156
19825,KRAMER, No.,156
19826,MR. GRAHAM, I don't think there's no way how we can allow you to keep this Tony. Unless...,156
19827,KRAMER, Anything...,156
19828,MALCOLM," Are you familiar with our star, Raquel Welch?",156
19829,KRAMER," Oh yeah, she's fantastic....",156
19830,MR. GRAHAM, She's a train wreck.,156
19831,MALCOLM, There's a big tap dance number just before Jean Harris leaves the  school to confront Dr Tarnover.,156
19832,MR. GRAHAM, It is a gut wrenching scene.,156
19833,MALCOLM," But, Raquel Welch doesn't move her arms when she tap dances. It's very distracting.",156
19834,MR. GRAHAM, There's lot of this  in tap dancing.,156
19835,KRAMER," So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?",156
19836,MALCOLM," No, we want you to fire her.",156
19837,JERRY, Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?,156
19838,KRAMER," Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true.",156
19839,JERRY, She seems very nice.,156
19840,KRAMER," Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.",156
19841,JERRY, I'm in show business.,156
19842,KRAMER," Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.",156
19843,JERRY, I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.,156
19844,KRAMER, Yayaya...,156
19845,ELAINE," Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.",156
19846,ELAINE, She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.,156
19847,JERRY, Did you tell Peterman about this?,156
19848,ELAINE," Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.",156
19849,KRAMER, Cat fight?,156
19850,ELAINE," Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?",156
19851,KRAMER, Yeye cat fight!,156
19852,JERRY, Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.,156
19853,KRAMER, T-t-t-t...,156
19854,JERRY, You got the tickets?,156
19855,GEORGE," Yeah, two for the 7",156
19856,JERRY, I like it.,156
19857,GEORGE," She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. ",156
19858,JERRY, What?,156
19859,GEORGE," Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey... Go get'em you're a tiger!",156
19860,JERRY," Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.",156
19861,GEORGE, A little notice would've helped! How many people?,156
19862,JERRY," 35, and George, on the invitations...",156
19863,GEORGE," I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...",156

19865,JERRY," I like your nails, that is a great color.",156
19866,LANETTE, Love the sweater.,156
19867,JERRY, This old thing?,156
19868,GEORGE," Hi, I need some party invitations.",156
19869,CLERK," Okay, have you been in here before?",156
19870,GEORGE, About a year ago. Wedding invitations.,156
19871,CLERK," Right, how did that all work out?",156
19872,GEORGE, No complaints.,156
19873,CLERK," Well, they are arranged according the price. And as I recall...",156
19874,GEORGE," Actually,  I'll take these nice glossy ones.",156
19875,RAQUEL," ""You are a fraud Dr Tarnover. You haven't even been to Scarsdale.""",156
19876,KRAMER, Ms. Welch.,156
19877,RAQUEL, Who are you?,156

19879,RAQUEL," Hello, Sidney! No, no I told you I don't want to do that! If you bring it up again I will feed your genitals to a wolf!  Kids! You're still here.",156
19880,KRAMER," Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.",156
19881,RAQUEL, What kind of problem?,156
19882,KRAMER," Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...",156
19883,RAQUEL, Out with it!,156
19884,KRAMER," Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...",156
19885,GUY, Little help?,156
19886,GEORGE," Hey, frolf?",156
19887,GUY," Yeah, you know we need a fourth for the back nine. You want in?",156
19888,GEORGE," Yeah, sure.",156
19889,GUY," Ok, come on.",156
19890,JERRY," Ok, let's towel it up.",156
19891,LANETTE," Jerry, where are those invitations you were supposed to get? If they don't go out today they're useless.",156
19892,JERRY, But we're in towels.,156
19893,LANETTE, Jerry.,156
19894,JERRY, all right. One second.,156
19895,GEORGE," He frolfs, he scores...",156
19896,GEORGE, Hello.,156
19897,JERRY," George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!",156
19898,LANETTE, Did you shave your chest hair?,156
19899,JERRY, No.  Did you at least pick them up?,156
19900,GEORGE," Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.",156
19901,JERRY," Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.",156
19902,GEORGE," All right, All right, keep your towel on.",156
19903,JERRY,...what?,156
19904,GEORGE, It's a joke.,156
19905,JERRY," All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!",156
19906,ELAINE, Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!,156
19907,ELAINE," Look, just because I'm a woman...",156
19908,RAQUEL, I don't move my arms when I dance. That's my signature!,156
19909,ELAINE," Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks.",156
19910,ELAINE, Like this...,156
19911,RAQUEL, What the hell is that? Are you making fun of my dancing?,156
19912,ELAINE, Aren't you Raquel Welch?,156
19913,RAQUEL," You know who I am. Now, what are you doing?",156
19914,ELAINE," Nothing, I wasn't just moving my arms...",156
19915,RAQUEL," That's it, you are going down.",156
19916,KRAMER, So how's George?,156
19917,JERRY, I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? ,156
19918,KRAMER, Tony.,156
19919,JERRY, What happened to you?,156
19920,KRAMER, Raquel Welch!,156
19921,JERRY, Yikes.,156
19922,JERRY, What happened to you?,156

19924,KRAMER, The woman is a menace.,156
19925,ELAINE," Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.",156
19926,JERRY, Cat fight with Raquel Welch.,156

19930,JERRY, Back on the rack.,156
19931,GEORGE, With the two of us?,156
19932,JERRY, I think we're still a man short.,156
19933,DOCTOR," Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to a period of extreme inactivity. But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there's a good chance you may, one day, walk again.",156
19934,KRAMER," Well, that's good news.",156
19935,ELAINE," Wow, invitations again...",156
19936,KRAMER," Yeah, that's weird.",156
19937,ELAINE," All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?",156
19938,JERRY, Yeah...,156
19939,KRAMER, I'd like to get some coffee.,156

19941,THERAPIST," Now, swing them...swing...swing them, just swing them.",156
19942,SAM, I can't do it. It's hard!,156
19943,GEORGE, Still a little summer left.,156
19944,THOMASSOULO," George, you’re not really handicapped, are you?",158
19945,GEORGE, I’ve had my difficulties.,158
19946,THOMASSOULO, I saw you running down Amsterdam Avenue lifting that 200 pound motorized cart with one hand.,158
19947,GEORGE," Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?",158
19948,THOMASSOULO, No,158
19949,GEORGE, How about the old Spider Man live action show?,158
19950,THOMASSOULO," George, I’ve realized we’ve signed a one-year contract with you, but at this point I think it’s best that we both go our separate ways.",158
19951,GEORGE, I don’t understand.,158
19952,THOMASSOULO, We don’t like you. We want you to leave.,158
19953,GEORGE, Clearer,158
19954,JERRY, So you’re staying at Play Now?,158
19955,GEORGE," Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.",158
19956,JERRY," But they not you aren’t handicapped, aren’t you ashamed?",158
19957,GEORGE," They’re the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.",158
19958,ELAINE, Hey,158
19959,GEORGE, Hello-o-o-o Elaine!,158
19960,ELAINE, What’s that?,158
19961,JERRY," Oh, it’s just this stupid thing.",158
19962,ELAINE," Well, I’m sure it’s stupid. It’s not about me, is it?",158
19963,JERRY,  No-o-o-o.,158
19964,GEORGE,  Not at all.,158
19965,ELAINE, Tell me!,158

19978,JERRY," Well, that’s it. You two are back together.",158
19979,ELAINE, What?,158
19980,JERRY, The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.,158
19981,ELAINE, David and I will not be getting back together.,158
19982,JERRY," Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You can’t do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.",158
19983,GEORGE, That’s beautiful.,158
19984,ELAINE," What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.",158
19985,JERRY," That’s different. I didn’t have feelings for those people. But you, you’ll backslide",158
19986,ELAINE, You want to bet?,158
19987,JERRY, Stakes?,158

19995,JERRY, Yeah.,158
19996,CLARE, What’s wrong with the belt?,158
19997,JERRY," I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So… that’s it!",158
19998,CLARE," So, you’re insane?",158
19999,JERRY," Oh yes, quite.",158
20000,KRAMER, Hello!,158

20005,KRAMER," Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.",158
20006,JERRY," Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, that’s a good idea.",158
20007,KRAMER," Of course it’s a good idea, it’s my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.",158
20008,JERRY, Which part? The renovating the restaurant you don’t own part or spending the two hundred million you don’t have part?,158
20009,KRAMER," You see I come up with these things, I know they’re gold, but nothing happens. You know why?",158
20010,JERRY," No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.",158
20011,KRAMER,"  No, no…time! It’s all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?",158
20012,JERRY, I can ball park it.,158
20013,ELAINE,  Hello-o-o-o!,158
20014,KRAMER, Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!,158
20015,JERRY," Hey, I called you last night, where were you?",158

20022,ELAINE," Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.",158
20023,JERRY," Your hair, it’s somewhat de-poofed.",158
20024,ELAINE, It’s the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?,158
20025,JERRY," Wait a second, what’s going on here?",158
20026,ELAINE," Nothing, nothing.",158

20030,KRAMER, Hoochie moochie. ,158
20031,JERRY, Hand it over. Pay up.,158
20032,ELAINE," No! It’s an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!",158
20033,JERRY, Then what do you call it? People don’t just bump into each other and have sex. This isn’t cinemax.,158
20034,ELAINE," It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.",158
20035,JERRY," Ah, dinner! That’s it, you’re all the way back!",158
20036,ELAINE, Ugh!,158
20037,JERRY," Sex, that’s meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; that’s heavy. That’s like an hour.",158
20038,KRAMER,"  Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun . That was my idea too!",158
20039,GEORGE, Good Morning!,158
20040,GEORGE," Hi Allison, that’s a nice dress.",158
20041,ALLISON, Don’t even look at me.,158
20042,GEORGE, Hey Glenn!,158
20043,GLENN," Hey, go tell hell!",158
20044,GEORGE, Heard that one already.,158
20045,KRAMER," …So that’s the bedroom. Here’s the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchen…Yeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.",158
20046,JERRY, And you are?,158
20047,DARREN," Oh, hey, I’m Darren. I’m new here.",158
20048,KRAMER," Yeah, that’s Jerry, you don’t have to worry about him. Why don’t you go across the hall and get started on that mail.",158
20049,DARREN, Right!,158
20050,KRAMER, He’s a go getter!,158
20051,JERRY, Who’s he?,158
20052,KRAMER," My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.",158
20053,JERRY, Alright.,158
20054,KRAMER," Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.",158
20055,JERRY, But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.,158
20056,KRAMER," Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.",158
20057,JERRY," Alright, it’s time to go.",158
20058,KRAMER," Jerry, it’s not for people, it’s for oil tankers.",158
20059,JERRY,  I know!,158
20060,KRAMER," You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil won’t spill out.",158
20061,JERRY," Actually, that is not a bad idea.",158
20062,KRAMER,  yeah.,158
20063,JERRY," Now, it’s time to go.",158
20064,JERRY, Hello,158

20066,JERRY,"  Hello-o-o-o.  So, what’s going on?",158
20067,GEORGE," Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. They’ve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. I’m like Hitler’s last days here.",158
20068,JERRY," So, are you going to leave?",158
20069,GEORGE," Oh no! I’m vigilant. They’ll never get me out. I’m like a weed, Jerry.",158
20070,JERRY, I thought you’re like Hitler in the bunker?,158
20071,GEORGE, I’m a weed in Hitler’s bunker.,158
20072,JERRY," I’m getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff.  I’m getting another call, see ya… Hello!",158

20082,JERRY," Oh yeah, hold on.",158
20083,JERRY," Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerry’s office. . We’re going to be three for lunch.  What do you mean he’s already left?",158
20084,JERRY," Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?",158

20086,JERRY," Well, just…",158
20087,KRAMER,  DARREN!,158
20088,ELAINE," I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddy’s. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. I’ll call.  Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. That’s funny. That’s really funny. That’s really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. .",158
20089,GEORGE," Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.",158

20092,JERRY," So, how hot did it get?",158
20093,GEORGE," I don’t know, 120, 130…Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.",158
20094,JERRY," I guess you can take anything, but actual work.",158
20095,GEORGE, Bring it on!,158

20099,KRAMER," Sorry I couldn’t get out of there, what did I miss? ",158
20100,DARREN," Well, after ordering, Mr. Seinfeld and Mr. Costanza debated on whether or not iron man wore some sort under garment between his skin and his iron suit…",158
20101,KRAMER, Uh huh…,158
20102,GEORGE,  And I still say he’s naked under there!,158
20103,JERRY, Oh that makes a lot of sense.,158
20104,GEORGE," Oh, shut up!",158
20105,DARREN," …Then Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom, at which point Mr. Costanza scooped ice out of Mr. Seinfeld’s drink with his bare hands using it to wash up  then Mr. Costanza remarked to me, ""This never happened."" .",158

20111,CLARE, So is it fun humiliating me?,158
20112,JERRY," No, it’s not you. It’s your stomach, he’s taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice.  Hello-o-o-o.",158
20113,CLARE, So you think I’m fat?,158
20114,JERRY, No it’s…,158
20115,DARREN," Mr. Kramer says, ""hey buddy!""",158
20116,JERRY," Hey, we’re kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?",158

20119,CLARE, I’m leaving too.,158
20120,JERRY," No body said you’re fat. He’s a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.",158
20121,CLARE, He is fat!,158
20122,JERRY," No, he’s just a little bloated.",158
20123,CLARE, Good-bye!,158
20124,JERRY, It’s mostly water weight.,158
20125,KRAMER," Boysenberry, the kid is still learning.",158
20126,DARREN," Mr. Kramer…Dean, my internship is on line two, she wants to set up a meeting.",158
20127,KRAMER," Yeah, well nothing before noon.",158
20128,JERRY, Line two?,158
20129,KRAMER," Yeah, your phone is line one.",158
20130,JERRY, Oh…,158
20131,PUDDY, So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.,158
20132,ELAINE," See, this is what Jerry’s doesn’t understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesn’t mean we are back together.",158
20133,PUDDY, I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.,158
20134,ELAINE, Yeah.,158
20135,PUDDY, Not having to do all that…you know…work.,158
20136,ELAINE," Well, either way…",158
20137,PUDDY," All that calling you, and buying you stuff…",158
20138,ELAINE, David…,158
20139,PUDDY, Caring about how everyone at work isn’t as smart as you. It’s brutal.,158
20140,ELAINE, Alright that’s it! We’re back together!,158
20141,PUDDY," Oh, no.",158
20142,ELAINE," Oh, yeah.",158
20143,PUDDY," Look Elaine, be reasonable.",158
20144,ELAINE, Get those clothes off. You’re going to spend the night and we’re going to cuddle.,158
20145,PUDDY, What?,158
20146,ELAINE, You heard me. Strip!,158
20147,GEORGE, ….….Alright……OK….,158
20148,GEORGE,"  Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? …Yes. If he needs me, tell him  I’M IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.",158
20149,KRAMER," Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?",158
20150,DEAN JONES, I’ve been reviewing Darren’s internship journal. Doing laundry…,158
20151,KRAMER, …Yeah.,158
20152,DEAN JONES," …Mending chicken wire, hi-tea with a Mr. Newman.",158
20153,KRAMER," I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but it’s business as usual at Kramerica.",158
20154,DEAN JONES, As far as I can tell your entire enterprise is more than a solitary man with a messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken.,158
20155,KRAMER," And with Darren’s help, we’ll get that chicken.",158
20156,DEAN JONES," I’m sorry, but we can’t allow Darren to continue working with you.",158
20157,KRAMER," Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.",158
20158,DEAN JONES, You fly is open.,158
20159,JERRY, So you’re sure you’re not still angry about last night?,158
20160,CLARE," No, I’m fine. Just as long as you don’t ever do that voice again.",158
20161,JERRY, Never?,158
20162,CLARE, Never.,158
20163,JERRY, What about if you’re not around?,158
20164,CLARE, No!,158
20165,JERRY, So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?,158
20166,CLARE, That’s right.,158
20167,JERRY, I can do that.,158
20168,CLARE, So what’s your decision?,158
20169,JERRY, I don’t know.,158
20170,CLARE, Jerry…HI.,158
20171,JERRY,  Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. ,158
20172,GEORGE, You broke up with her? Why?,158
20173,JERRY, So we could do the voice.  La-la-la. What’s the matter?,158
20174,GEORGE, I think I’m getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?,158
20175,JERRY," No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish.  Hola. Hello-o-o-o.",158
20176,GEORGE, I think I like the girl better than the voice.,158
20177,JERRY, Really?,158
20178,JERRY,  Hello-o-o-o.,158
20179,ELAINE, Still?,158
20180,GEORGE, I told you.,158
20181,ELAINE," Alright, here you go, choke on it .",158
20182,JERRY," See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.",158
20183,ELAINE," Yeah, well not for long. I’m breaking up with him.",158
20184,JERRY," No, I don’t think so. I’ve seen you two together. You make each other miserable. It’s kismet.",158
20185,ELAINE, Double or nothing.,158
20186,JERRY, Done.,158
20187,GEORGE,  Witness?,158
20188,JERRY, You’re in there again.,158
20189,GEORGE, I think Play Now is putting something in my food.,158
20190,ELAINE," Alright, I’m out of here.",158
20191,JERRY, What is this? .,158
20192,KRAMER, I don’t know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I haven’t been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. I’m clueless.  Is that clock right?,158
20193,JERRY, Yeah. Nine o’clock.,158
20194,KRAMER, I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.,158
20195,JERRY,  Good-bye Kramer.,158
20196,KRAMER," Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.",158
20197,JERRY, Really?,158
20198,KRAMER, So played.,158
20199,GEORGE, I told you.,158
20200,KRAMER, Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.,158
20201,DARREN, I don’t care about the internship. I care about Kramerica.,158
20202,KRAMER, Kramerica is no more.,158
20203,DARREN, What about the oil tanker bladder system? We were going to put an end to maritime oil spills.,158
20204,KRAMER," Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.",158
20205,KRAMER," Well, you’re still here?",158
20206,DARREN, I haven’t had time to leave.,158
20207,KRAMER," Well, I haven’t changed my mind.",158
20208,KRAMER," Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, I’ll do it. Kramerica industries lives! Let’s get back to work!",158
20209,KRAMER, Let’s see what Jerry has to eat.,158
20210,THOMASSOULO," You win George. We’ve had it. If you leave right now, Play Now will give you six months pay. That’s half of your entire contract. Please…just go.",158
20211,GEORGE," You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.",158
20212,THOMASSOULO," Want to play hand ball huh? Fine.  Attention Play Now employees, George Costanza’s handicapped bathroom is now open on the sixteenth floor to all employees and their families.",158
20213,GEORGE, Well played.,158
20214,THOMASSOULO, I’ll see you in hell Costanza.,158
20215,JERRY,"  Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second.  So we definitely don’t want to do the voice anymore?  Alright, we’re back together again, great. Bye bye.",158
20216,KRAMER, Hey.,158
20217,JERRY, Trouble down at the plant?,158
20218,KRAMER, It’s a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.,158
20219,GEORGE, You have to drink that whole thing?,158
20220,KRAMER, No. No. No. It’s for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.,158
20221,JERRY, I understand .,158
20222,GEORGE, Would a giant rubber ball work?,158
20223,KRAMER, Conceivably.,158
20224,GEORGE," Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why don’t we test your bladder system at my office?",158
20225,JERRY, You’re not…,158
20226,GEORGE," Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, there’s nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.",158
20227,PUDDY," Hey, you want to split a root beer ?",158
20228,ELAINE," I don’t think so David, we’re through.",158
20229,PUDDY, Oh…That’s a nice sweater .,158
20230,ELAINE, Whew that was a dozy.,158
20231,JERRY, Go again?,158
20232,ELAINE, Book it.,158
20233,GEORGE,  Witness.,158
20234,ELAINE," David I know this hurts, but it’s the way it has to be .",158
20235,JERRY, Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.,158
20236,ELAINE, I’m going to get some popcorn.,158
20237,ELAINE," So, how did it end?",158
20238,JERRY, They got away.,158
20239,ELAINE, uh.,158
20240,ELAINE," Listen David, I’ve got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?",158
20241,JERRY, Hey.,158
20242,KRAMER, Did you bring the video camera?,158
20243,JERRY," Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, I’ll see ya.",158
20244,GEORGE," Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.",158
20245,JERRY, I can’t. I got to meet Clare.,158
20246,KRAMER, You gave up the voice?,158
20247,JERRY," Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.",158
20248,JERRY, Darren?,158
20249,DARREN, Sorry Mr. Seinfeld.,158
20250,JERRY," Uh, bathroom.",158
20251,GEORGE," Hey, use mine. I’ll let you in.",158
20252,JERRY, I thought it was open to the public.,158
20253,GEORGE," I uh, took care of that.",158
20254,JERRY, Wow! Zanadu . No wonder you’re putting in so many hours.  May I?,158
20255,GEORGE, I insist. I’ll fix us a drink.  I got it.,158
20256,KRAMER," Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day I’d be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I would’ve said you’re crazy… Now let’s push this giant ball of oil out the window.",158
20257,GEORGE," So, check out my view.",158
20258,JERRY," Wow! Hey, there’s Clare. I better go down.",158
20259,GEORGE," Hey, there’s Kramer & Darren.",158
20260,JERRY, There’s the giant ball of oil. Clare’s right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!,158
20261,CLARE, I don’t believe this. I am not looking up if you’re going to do that voice.,158
20262,KRAMER, Bombs away .,158
20263,JERRY, This is going to be a shame.,158
20264,GEORGE, Hello.,158
20265,KRAMER," Well, that didn’t work. Hey, how about this…ketchup and mustard in the same bottle?",158
20266,DARREN, Oh that sounds interesting sir.,158
20267,KRAMER, Yeah.,158
20268,JERRY," Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess you’re not going in anymore.",158
20269,GEORGE, Yeah.,158
20270,JERRY, So they’re not paying you your…,158
20271,GEORGE, No.,158
20272,JERRY, So you’re pretty much…,158
20273,GEORGE, Yeah.,158
20274,JERRY, What ever happened to Darren?,158
20275,KRAMER, Darren is going away for a long long time.,158
20276,JERRY, So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that…  Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil…,158
20277,GEORGE,  I’m slippery as an eel…,158
20278,KRAMER,  La la la.,158
20279,JERRY, I’m just so glad it’s back.,158
20280,ELAINE," See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.",158
20281,PUDDY, ELAINE,158
20282,ELAINE, Ah nuts!,158
20283,FRANK, I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.,159
20284,ESTELLE, That's as far as it goes.,159
20285,FRANK," There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight.",159
20286,ESTELLE, I pulled it. It doesn't go.,159
20287,FRANK," If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism!",159
20288,GEORGE," All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.",159
20289,FRANK," Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal! Serenity now! Serenity now!",159
20290,GEORGE, What is that?,159
20291,FRANK," Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'",159
20292,GEORGE, Are you supposed to yell it?,159
20293,FRANK, The man on the tape wasn't specific.,159
20294,GEORGE, What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?,159
20295,ESTELLE, I told you to fix that thing.,159
20296,FRANK, Serenity nowww!,159
20297,PATTY, So I told Bobby and Lisa that we'd try the new Chinese Spanish,159
20298,JERRY," Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.",159
20299,PATTY, Well I thought this would be more fun so I gave the tickets away.,159
20300,JERRY," What? All right, fine.",159
20301,PATTY, Are you mad at me?,159
20302,JERRY," No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.",159
20303,PATTY, You know... I've never seen you mad.,159
20304,JERRY, I get peeved.,159
20305,PATTY, Mad.,159
20306,JERRY, Miffed.,159
20307,PATTY, *Mad*.,159
20308,JERRY, Irked?,159
20309,PATTY, I'd like to see you get *really* mad.,159
20310,GEORGE, Why does she want you to be mad?,159
20311,JERRY, She says I suppress my emotions.,159
20312,GEORGE, So what do you care what she thinks.,159
20313,JERRY, Good body.,159
20314,GEORGE, She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.,159
20315,JERRY," But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.",159
20316,GEORGE, Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. ,159
20317,KRAMER, Hey.,159
20318,JERRY," Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!",159
20319,KRAMER,"  What is that, a new bit?",159
20320,GEORGE," I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?",159
20321,JERRY," Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.",159
20322,KRAMER, I'll do it.,159
20323,GEORGE, Really? You wanna come?,159
20324,KRAMER," Yeah, I love going to the country.",159
20325,ELAINE, Where are they goin'?,159
20326,JERRY, Fix a screen door in Queens.,159
20327,ELAINE,"  That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?",159
20328,JERRY, Not goin' to the Knick game.,159
20329,ELAINE, I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.,159
20330,JERRY," You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.",159
20331,ELAINE,"  Oh, I don't think that's possible.",159
20332,KRAMER,  Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door.  Perfect.,159
20333,GEORGE," Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.",159
20334,ESTELLE, I hate that old door. Throw it out!,159
20335,FRANK, Serenity now!,159
20336,KRAMER," It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.",159
20337,FRANK, Will you put her to rest for me?,159
20338,KRAMER," Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her.   ",159
20339,ESTELLE,  Get George to put those boxes in the garage.,159
20340,GEORGE," Dad, what's all this?",159
20341,ESTELLE,  It's junk.,159
20342,FRANK, My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!,159
20343,GEORGE, You're selling computers?,159
20344,FRANK," Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading, and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched.",159
20345,GEORGE," Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?",159
20346,FRANK," Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son.",159
20347,JERRY," Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!",159
20348,PATTY, I think they have 1% over there.,159
20349,JERRY, 1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!,159
20350,PATTY," OK, Jerry, enough. I'm not buying it.",159
20351,JERRY, You're damn right you're not buying it!,159
20352,PATTY, You shouldn't have to try. It's just being open.,159
20353,JERRY, I'm open. There's just nothing in there.,159
20354,PATTY, Sarcastically) Uh huh.,159
20355,JERRY," Oh, you think I'm lying about this?",159
20356,PATTY, I think you are.,159
20357,JERRY," Well, I'm not.",159
20358,PATTY," Yes, you are, liar.",159
20359,JERRY," Oh, stop it.",159
20360,PATTY," OK, liar.",159
20361,JERRY, That's enough!,159
20362,PATTY," Ooh, that was good.",159
20363,JERRY, Really? It felt good.,159
20364,ELAINE," Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.",159
20365,LIPPMAN," Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today. Can you believe it? He's a man.",159
20366,ELAINE," Oh, congratulations, Adam. ",159
20367,ADAM, I'm a man!,159
20368,JERRY, Tongue?,159
20369,ELAINE, Yeah.,159
20370,GEORGE, Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.,159
20371,JERRY, Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.,159
20372,ELAINE, And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. ,159
20373,JERRY," Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye.  Hey, I'm flyin' first class.",159
20374,ELAINE, Where did that come from?,159
20375,JERRY, Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?,159
20376,ELAINE, No.,159
20377,JERRY, Good.,159
20378,GEORGE," All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.",159
20379,JERRY, What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.,159
20380,GEORGE, Kramer.,159
20381,KRAMER, Yeah.,159
20382,GEORGE, What-what are you doing?,159
20383,KRAMER," Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.",159
20384,JERRY, What do you need it for?,159
20385,KRAMER,"  The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.",159
20386,GEORGE," Morning, ma.",159
20387,ESTELLE,  You're late!,159
20388,GEORGE," Morning, dad.",159
20389,FRANK," I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun.",159
20390,LLOYD,"  Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar.",159
20391,GEORGE, What is Lloyd Braun doing here?,159
20392,FRANK, Your mother recommended him.,159
20393,GEORGE," Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?",159
20394,FRANK, I didn't read his resume.,159
20395,LLOYD,"  Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on the big board.",159
20396,GEORGE,  What is this?,159
20397,FRANK,"  This is your lagging. Good work, Braun.",159
20398,ESTELLE,"  Good for you, Lloyd!",159
20399,ELAINE," So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.",159
20400,ADAM, I'm not apologizing. It was great. I told everyone.,159
20401,ELAINE," Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.",159
20402,ADAM, Are you free Friday night?,159
20403,ELAINE," I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.",159
20404,ADAM, But I'm a man. The rabbi said so.,159
20405,ELAINE," No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.",159
20406,ADAM," Well, if I'm not a man, then this whole thing was a sham! First, they said I was gonna get great gifts, and then, somebody gives me Boggle. I renounce my religion!",159
20407,LIPPMAN, Who wants cookies?,159
20408,ADAM," As of this moment, I am no longer Jewish. I quit!",159
20409,LIPPMAN, What?,159
20410,ELAINE,"  Walnuts, mmmmmm.  ",159
20411,FRANK," You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner gets a Waterpik.",159
20412,ESTELLE,  You're not giving away our Waterpik!,159
20413,FRANK, Serenity now!,159
20414,GEORGE," You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!",159
20415,FRANK, I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun! ,159
20416,GEORGE," You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you!  Serenity now!",159
20417,ELAINE," Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.",159
20418,ADAM,"  Well, that does me a lot of good. 'Early 20s'!",159
20419,ELAINE," Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.",159
20420,LIPPMAN," So, that's the type of guy you're looking for?",159
20421,ELAINE, Uhh. I guess so. Why? ,159
20422,PATTY,  What is this?,159
20423,JERRY,"  Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.",159
20424,KRAMER,"  Hello, neighbor.",159
20425,JERRY," Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.",159
20426,KRAMER," Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.",159
20427,JERRY, You barbecuing tonight?,159
20428,KRAMER,  Right after the fireworks.,159
20429,JERRY," So, where do you want to eat tonight?",159
20430,PATTY, How about La Caridad again?,159
20431,JERRY, Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?,159
20432,PATTY," Jerry, you've been yelling at me all afternoon.",159
20433,JERRY," Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!",159
20434,PATTY, Maybe I should just leave.,159
20435,JERRY, 'Maybe'!?,159
20436,PATTY, Good-bye!,159
20437,JERRY, Double good-bye! ,159
20438,KRAMER," Hey, buddy!",159
20439,ELAINE,  Hey. Happy New Year!,159
20440,KRAMER,  Y'all come back reeeaall...,159
20441,ELAINE, Did you and Patty just break up?,159
20442,JERRY," Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!",159
20443,ELAINE," Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.",159
20444,JERRY," That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.",159
20445,ELAINE, Whoa. What is the matter?,159
20446,JERRY, It's Patty.,159
20447,ELAINE," Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.",159
20448,JERRY,  What--what is this salty discharge?,159
20449,ELAINE, Oh my God. You're crying.,159
20450,JERRY, This is horrible! I care!,159
20451,JERRY, Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.,159
20452,KRAMER," She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?",159
20453,JERRY, I don't know what's happening to me.,159
20454,KRAMER," Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.",159
20455,JERRY, That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.,159
20456,KRAMER," Yeah, well, she... had one, too. ",159
20457,GEORGE," Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? ",159
20458,KRAMER,"  That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!",159
20459,GEORGE,  Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.,159
20460,JERRY, You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?,159
20461,GEORGE," Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.",159
20462,JERRY," Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?",159
20463,GEORGE, What?,159
20464,JERRY," I love you, George. Come here.",159
20465,GEORGE," I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.",159
20466,JERRY, Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.,159
20467,KRAMER," Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?",159
20468,JERRY," Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!",159
20469,KRAMER," I love you, too, buddy, and George--",159
20470,GEORGE," I don't want to hear it, Kramer!",159
20471,KRAMER," Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.",159
20472,GEORGE, What signal? What-what signal?,159
20473,KRAMER," I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'",159
20474,GEORGE," If I do it, will you buy a computer?",159
20475,KRAMER," On the signal, George. On the signal.",159
20476,GEORGE, Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.,159
20477,JERRY," I love you, Costanza.",159
20478,GEORGE, Will you shut up?!,159
20479,KRAMER," Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!",159
20480,ELAINE, So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.,159
20481,GEORGE," Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.",159
20482,ELAINE, What?,159
20483,GEORGE, It means a non-Jewish woman.,159
20484,ELAINE," I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?",159
20485,GEORGE, You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.,159
20486,ELAINE," Oh, that's insane.",159
20487,GEORGE, I'll tell you what's insane,159
20488,ELAINE, I am not buying a computer from you.,159
20489,GEORGE, There's porn.,159
20490,ELAINE,  Even so.,159
20491,GEORGE, Damn it!,159
20492,ELAINE," Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.",159
20493,LIPPMAN, That's simply not true.,159
20494,ELAINE," If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.",159
20495,LIPPMAN, You are wrong. I'll prove it.,159
20496,ELAINE," Oh, no. Don't!",159
20497,LIPPMAN, I renounce Judaism!,159
20498,ELAINE, Oy vey!,159
20499,JERRY," What happened to you, pal?",159
20500,KRAMER, Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.,159
20501,JERRY, Are you all right?,159
20502,KRAMER," Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.",159
20503,JERRY," So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?",159
20504,KRAMER,"  Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!",159
20505,ELAINE,"  Hey, what happened to you?",159
20506,KRAMER, Serenity! ,159
20507,ELAINE, Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?,159
20508,JERRY," Sit down, Elaine.",159
20509,ELAINE," Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.",159
20510,JERRY, I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.,159
20511,ELAINE, Do you have an apple or anything?,159
20512,JERRY," Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.",159
20513,ELAINE, Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.,159
20514,JERRY, Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...,159
20515,ELAINE," Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!",159
20516,JERRY," When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!",159
20517,ELAINE, What?,159
20518,JERRY, Elaine...,159
20519,GEORGE,"  Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?",159
20520,JERRY, I'm asking Elaine to marry me.,159
20521,GEORGE,  I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.,159
20522,JERRY, Elaine?,159
20523,ELAINE," Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.",159
20524,JERRY, Lippman?,159
20525,ELAINE,"  Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!",159
20526,JERRY, Can I help you?,159
20527,ELAINE, No. Stay! Stay. Stay.,159
20528,FRANK," Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt!",159
20529,GEORGE,"  Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?",159
20530,FRANK," Costanza, you're white hot!",159
20531,PHONE," If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and--",159
20532,FRANK," Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the same",159
20533,ESTELLE, You're not gonna give away that water pik!,159
20534,FRANK," You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now!",159
20535,LLOYD," You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you blow.",159
20536,GEORGE, What do you know? You were in the nut house.,159
20537,LLOYD, What do you think put me there?,159
20538,GEORGE, I heard they found a family in your freezer,159
20539,LLOYD, Serenity now. Insanity later.,159
20540,JERRY," What happened here, Kramer?",159
20541,KRAMER," Serenity now, serenity now...",159
20542,JERRY, Kramer!,159
20543,KRAMER," Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.",159
20544,JERRY, You don't look well.,159
20545,KRAMER," Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.",159
20546,JERRY," Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.",159
20547,KRAMER,"  Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!",159
20548,GEORGE, Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!,159
20549,KRAMER,  Serenity now!,159
20550,GEORGE," Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?",159
20551,KRAMER,  Serenity nooooowwwww!,159
20552,GEORGE, Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?,159
20553,KRAMER,"  George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.",159
20554,JERRY, He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?,159
20555,GEORGE," Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.",159
20556,JERRY," George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?",159
20557,GEORGE, All right... here goes...,159
20558,ELAINE," Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?",159
20559,RABBI," Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the Yeti, or his North American cousin, the Sasquatch.",159
20560,ELAINE," Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.",159
20561,RABBI," Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish religion. For example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date?",159
20562,ELAINE,"  Well, what does that have to do...?",159
20563,RABBI," You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle Beach. Perhaps, if you're not too busy, we could wing on down after the High Holidays? Elaine? 'Lainie?",159
20564,GEORGE," So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.",159
20565,JERRY," Yikes. Well, good look with all that.",159
20566,GEORGE, Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.,159
20567,JERRY, I think you scared me straight.,159
20568,ELAINE," All right, Jerome, I'm in.",159
20569,JERRY, What?,159
20570,ELAINE, Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.,159
20571,JERRY," I tell ya, I don't see it happening.",159
20572,ELAINE, What? What happened to the new Jerry?,159
20573,JERRY, He doesn't work here anymore.,159
20574,ELAINE," Oh, well that's just *great!*",159
20575,GEORGE," I love you, Jerry.",159
20576,JERRY,"  Right back at ya, Slick.",159
20577,GEORGE," You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.",159
20578,ELAINE," Well, that's because you're an idiot.",159
20579,FRANK, You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy.,159
20580,GEORGE, Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?,159
20581,FRANK, He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.,159
20582,ESTELLE, I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!,159
20583,FRANK, This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now!,159
20584,ESTELLE, All right...,159
20585,GEORGE," Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.",159
20586,FRANK," So, what am I supposed to say?",159
20587,GEORGE, 'Hoochie mama'?,159
20588,ESTELLE," Move your crap, I'm comin' in!",159
20589,FRANK, No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!,159
20590,JERRY," , go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, ""Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that?  That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?""",16
20591,ELAINE," No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.",16
20592,GEORGE," Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.",16
20593,JERRY," I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.",16
20594,ELAINE, You should run for mayor.,16
20595,JERRY," Ehh, nobody listens.",16
20596,ELAINE, Where is someone? I'm starving.,16
20597,GEORGE, I think this is him right here.,16
20598,ELAINE, Is there a table ready?,16
20599,RESTAURANT MANAGER , How many?,16
20600,ELAINE , How many?,16
20601,JERRY , Is Tatiana coming?,16
20602,GEORGE," I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.",16
20603,JERRY, Really? I thought things were going OK.,16
20604,GEORGE," They were, it's kinda complicated.",16
20605,JERRY, Well what is it?,16
20606,ELAINE, How many?,16
20607,JERRY," Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld.",16
20608,BRUCE," Four. It'll be five, ten minutes.",16
20609,GEORGE, What do you wanna do?,16
20610,ELAINE," Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.",16
20611,JERRY," We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.",16
20612,GEORGE, I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?,16
20613,JERRY , Tatiana...,16
20614,GEORGE," Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?",16
20615,BRUCE," Lashbrook, 4!",16
20616,JERRY, So did I do a terrible thing?,16
20617,ELAINE, You mean lying to your uncle?,16
20618,JERRY," I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!",16
20619,GEORGE ," You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just chit-chat.",16
20620,ELAINE," Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.",16
20621,JERRY," Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.",16
20622,GEORGE, He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.,16
20623,ELAINE," Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?",16
20624,JERRY," Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.",16
20625,ELAINE, Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.,16
20626,GEORGE, I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?,16
20627,ELAINE, What?,16
20628,JERRY," There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?",16
20629,ELAINE, I've never seen her before.,16
20630,JERRY, I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.,16
20631,MAN," Oh, Excuse me.",16
20632,ELAINE, I'm sorry.,16
20633,ELAINE," Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.",16
20634,JERRY, Well maybe they were here from before.,16
20635,ELAINE," No no no, they weren't here before.",16
20636,GEORGE ," Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call.",16
20637,ELAINE, Find out what's going on!,16
20638,JERRY," Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.",16
20639,ELAINE, Yeah.,16
20640,BRUCE, What's your name?,16
20641,JERRY, Seinfeld.,16
20642,BRUCE," No, no, they were here before. Keckitch, 2!",16
20643,ELAINE, Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.,16
20644,JERRY," Boy, you are really hungry.",16
20645,GEORGE , Hey!,16
20646,GEORGE," If anything happens here, can I count on you?",16
20647,JERRY, What?,16
20648,GEORGE, If we decide to go at it.,16
20649,JERRY," Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...",16
20650,GEORGE," I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.",16
20651,ELAINE, I'm gonna faint...,16
20652,JERRY," George, who is that woman in the stripes?",16
20653,GEORGE, I don't know her.,16
20654,JERRY, She looks so familiar.,16
20655,ELAINE," Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.",16
20656,JERRY," I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.",16
20657,ELAINE, What do you mean?,16
20658,JERRY," You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.",16
20659,GEORGE, What are they gonna do?,16
20660,JERRY," They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.",16
20661,ELAINE," 50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?",16
20662,JERRY," 50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.",16
20663,ELAINE," OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...",16
20664,JERRY," No, no tricks.",16
20665,ELAINE," Should I do it, George?",16
20666,GEORGE, For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.,16
20667,ELAINE," Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.",16
20668,ELAINE ," I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.",16
20669,ELAINE , I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.,16
20670,PEOPLE AT TABLE, What? What is she talking about? What did she say?,16
20671,JERRY, What happened?,16
20672,ELAINE, Did you see that?,16
20673,GEORGE, What were you doing?,16
20674,ELAINE ," I offered them 25, they had no idea...",16
20675,JERRY," George, the phone's free.",16
20676,GEORGE, Alleluia.,16
20677,GEORGE," Excuse me, I was waiting here.",16
20678,WOMAN AT PHONE, Where? I didn't see you.,16
20679,GEORGE, I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!,16
20680,WOMAN, Well I won't be long.,16
20681,GEORGE, That's not the point. The point is I was here first.,16
20682,WOMAN," Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.",16
20683,GEORGE ," You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way.",16
20684,GEORGE, Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!,16
20685,GUY," Hey, sorry I took so long.",16
20686,GEORGE," Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.",16
20687,ELAINE," How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.",16
20688,JERRY, I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?,16
20689,GEORGE," Yeah, well, he probably bought it.",16
20690,JERRY, So what happened with Tatiana?,16
20691,GEORGE, I shouldn't even tell you this.,16
20692,JERRY, Come on...,16
20693,GEORGE," Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.",16
20694,JERRY, I'm with you.,16
20695,GEORGE," Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...",16
20696,JERRY, This could only happen to you.,16
20697,GEORGE," So I finally stop and say, ""Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left"".",16
20698,JERRY, You said this to her after.,16
20699,GEORGE, No. During.,16
20700,JERRY," Oh, boy.",16
20701,GEORGE, Yeah.,16
20702,JERRY, Wow! So...?,16
20703,GEORGE," So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's",16
20704,ELAINE," I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.",16
20705,JERRY , Who is that woman?!,16
20706,ELAINE," Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.",16
20707,GEORGE, She's off. ,16
20708,ELAINE," Jerry, talk to that guy again.",16
20709,JERRY, What am I gonna say?,16
20710,ELAINE, Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.,16
20711,MR. COHEN," Hey, what stinks in here?",16
20712,MR. COHEN," Well, I've been looking for a better place.",16
20713,BRUCE, Better place... Want a table?,16
20714,MR. COHEN," No, just bring me a plate and I'll eat here.",16
20715,BRUCE ," Give him a plate and you eat here... Come on, I give you a table.",16
20716,JERRY," Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.",16
20717,BRUCE," Oh no, Mr. Cohen always here.",16
20718,ELAINE, He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?,16
20719,BRUCE," Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue.",16
20720,ELAINE, Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!,16
20721,GEORGE, She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.,16
20722,JERRY, Didja leave a message?,16
20723,GEORGE," Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.",16
20724,ELAINE," Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...",16
20725,JERRY, Where do I know her?,16
20726,LORRAINE," Hello, Jerry!",16
20727,JERRY, Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?,16
20728,LORRAINE, How is everything?,16
20729,JERRY," Good, good, good... What's goin' on?",16
20730,LORRAINE," Oh, working hard. And you?",16
20731,JERRY," Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.",16
20732,LORRAINE, You haven't been around in a while.,16
20733,JERRY," I know, I know... Well, you know.",16
20734,LORRAINE, You should come by.,16
20735,JERRY," Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.",16
20736,ELAINE," Hi, I'm Elaine.",16
20737,LORRAINE , Lorraine. Catalano.,16
20738,JERRY," I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...",16
20739,LORRAINE," Well it was nice seeing you, Jerry. And nice meeting you. ",16
20740,ELAINE ," Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!",16
20741,JERRY," Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.",16
20742,ELAINE, The one you broke the plans with tonight?,16
20743,JERRY," Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...",16
20744,JERRY," ...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.",16
20745,ELAINE, You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.,16
20746,JERRY," Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!",16
20747,JERRY," Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.",16
20748,ELAINE," Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.",16
20749,JERRY, In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?,16
20750,ELAINE," Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.",16
20751,GEORGE, 20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?,16
20752,ELAINE," Well what do you want to give him, change?",16
20753,GEORGE, It's more than the meal!,16
20754,JERRY," Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.",16
20755,GEORGE," Alright. 7,7,  6. I'm not gonna eat that much!",16
20756,JERRY," I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?",16
20757,GEORGE," Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.",16
20758,ELAINE," I guess it's you, Jer.",16
20759,JERRY, Me? What about you?,16
20760,ELAINE," Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.",16
20761,JERRY," The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?",16
20762,ELAINE, Give me the money.,16
20763,ELAINE, How's it going'?,16
20764,BRUCE, Very busy.,16
20765,ELAINE," Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.",16
20766,BRUCE, Very good specials tonight.,16
20767,ELAINE, If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.,16
20768,BRUCE, What is your name? ,16
20769,ELAINE," No no, I want to eat now! ",16
20770,BRUCE," Yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, very fresh.",16
20771,ELAINE ," Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!",16
20772,BRUCE," Dennison, 4!  Your table is ready.",16
20773,ELAINE," No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.",16
20774,JERRY, You lost the 20.,16
20775,ELAINE," Well, how could he do that?",16
20776,GEORGE, You didn't make it clear.,16
20777,ELAINE, Make it clear?,16
20778,JERRY," What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.",16
20779,BRUCE, Your name?,16
20780,JERRY, Seinfeld.,16
20781,BRUCE," Yeah, Seinfeld 4!",16
20782,JERRY," No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?",16
20783,BRUCE," Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very beautiful. Is your girlfriend?",16
20784,JERRY," Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.",16
20785,BRUCE, Relationships are difficult. It's very hard to stay together-,16
20786,JERRY," Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?",16
20787,BRUCE," Oh. In about five, ten minutes.",16
20788,GEORGE, So?,16
20789,JERRY, There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.,16
20790,ELAINE, So when are we gonna eat?,16
20791,JERRY," Five, ten minutes.",16
20792,GEORGE, We should have left earlier. I told you.,16
20793,JERRY, I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.,16
20794,ELAINE," Oh, well I have to eat.",16
20795,JERRY," Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.",16
20796,ELAINE, Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?,16
20797,JERRY, We'll eat it in the movie.,16
20798,ELAINE," Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?",16
20799,JERRY, Well what do you suggest?,16
20800,ELAINE," I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.",16
20801,JERRY," I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.",16
20802,BRUCE , Cartwright?,16
20803,ELAINE, I can't have popcorn for dinner!,16
20804,BRUCE, Cartwright?,16
20805,ELAINE , I have to eat!,16
20806,JERRY, So they have hotdogs there.,16
20807,ELAINE," Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.",16
20808,GEORGE," I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.",16
20809,GEORGE," Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?",16
20810,BRUCE," Yeah, I just got a call. I yell 'Cartwright! Cartwright!', just like that. Nobody came up, I hang up.",16
20811,GEORGE," Well, was it for Costanza or...",16
20812,BRUCE," Yes, yes, that's it. Nobody answered.",16
20813,GEORGE, Well was it a woman?,16
20814,BRUCE," Yeah, yeah. I tell her you not here, she said curse word, I hang up.",16
20815,GEORGE, She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.,16
20816,JERRY, Who's Cartwright?,16
20817,GEORGE, I'm Cartwright!,16
20818,JERRY, You're not Cartwri-,16
20819,GEORGE," Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.",16
20820,ELAINE," Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.",16
20821,JERRY, So You're not going?,16
20822,ELAINE, You don't need us.,16
20823,JERRY," Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.",16
20824,GEORGE, Should we tell him we're leaving?,16
20825,ELAINE, What for? Let's just get out of here.,16
20826,BRUCE," Seinfeld, 4?",16
20827,JERRY," Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, ""This is good, who is this? I like this person"". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like,  ""Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!""",16
20828,JERRY, Are you sure you can't stay longer?,160
20829,MORTY," No, we just came for the funeral. `",160
20830,HELEN," Poor Marvin Kessler, he went too early.",160
20831,JERRY, He was 96 years old.,160
20832,MORTY," That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.",160
20833,HELEN, That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.,160
20834,MORTY, And every morning I eat a plum.,160
20835,JERRY," Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.",160
20836,HELEN, What about you?,160
20837,MORTY," Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.",160
20838,JERRY, Really?,160
20839,KRAMER," Hey, Seinfelds!",160
20840,MORTY," Hey, Mr. Kramer!",160
20841,KRAMER, How long are you staying?,160
20842,HELEN, We just came down for a funeral.,160
20843,KRAMER," Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...",160
20844,HELEN, See you downstairs with the car.,160
20845,JERRY, Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?,160
20846,MORTY," No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here.",160
20847,JERRY, Did you give blood?,160
20848,KRAMER," No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.",160
20849,JERRY, In case of what?,160
20850,KRAMER," Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.",160
20851,JERRY, Are we finished?,160
20852,KRAMER, Done.,160
20853,VIVIAN," Elaine, I'm so glad you came out.",160
20854,ELAINE, Yeah...,160
20855,VIVIAN, You haven't seen Jimmy for years.,160
20856,ELAINE," I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.",160
20857,VIVIAN," Actually, I'm gonna need someone to look after him tomorrow evening.",160
20858,ELAINE," Tomorrow evening, sure.",160
20859,VIVIAN, Do you know anyone responsible?,160
20860,ELAINE, Do I know anyone??,160
20861,VIVIAN," Well, if you think of anybody, give me a call.",160
20862,GEORGE, What are you doing?,160
20863,TARA," Incense, for the mood.",160
20864,GEORGE," Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.",160
20865,GEORGE," Um, cream soda?",160
20866,TARA, Vanilla.,160
20867,ELAINE," Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?",160
20868,JERRY," Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is",160
20869,ELAINE," I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.",160
20870,JERRY," What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?",160
20871,GEORGE," I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!",160
20872,ELAINE, You just left? What did you tell her?,160
20873,GEORGE, I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.,160
20874,JERRY, What?,160
20875,GEORGE," I don't know, I was starving Jerry!",160
20876,GEORGE," Oh, pudding! You want some?",160
20877,JERRY," Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?",160
20878,GEORGE," What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.",160
20879,JERRY," Elaine, what do you think?",160
20880,ELAINE, I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.,160
20881,KRAMER," My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.",160
20882,BANK EMPLOYEE," Well, we can transfer to another bank for you.",160
20883,KRAMER," Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!",160
20884,GEORGE," So eh, what do you say?",160
20885,TARA, I guess we could use some food in our lovemaking.,160
20886,GEORGE," Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...",160
20887,TARA," Wait wait wait, pastrami on rye with mustard?",160
20888,GEORGE," Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?",160
20889,TARA, No.,160
20890,GEORGE," Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!",160
20891,JERRY," Didn't go for it, huh?",160
20892,GEORGE, No.,160
20893,JERRY," So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?",160
20894,GEORGE," She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.",160
20895,JERRY," Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.",160
20896,GEORGE," Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.",160
20897,JERRY," Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.",160
20898,GEORGE," Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.",160
20899,JERRY," I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.",160
20900,GEORGE," Well, I guess these would be out of the question. ",160
20901,JERRY, What the hell is that?,160
20902,GEORGE, Pudding skin singles.,160
20903,KRAMER," Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware.",160
20904,JERRY," Oh, why?",160
20905,KRAMER, I closed down my account at the blood bank.,160
20906,JERRY," What, it...it's here in the building?",160
20907,KRAMER," Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?",160
20908,JERRY," No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.",160
20909,KRAMER," You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.",160
20910,ELAINE," Hey, working out?",160
20911,JERRY, You know it and I ditched all my junk food.,160
20912,KRAMER, What the heck is going on here?,160
20913,JERRY," Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.",160
20914,KRAMER," Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.",160
20915,ELAINE, Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.,160
20916,JERRY, Is this about me?,160
20917,ELAINE, No.,160
20918,JERRY," Oh, then I lost interest.",160
20919,ELAINE," Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...",160
20920,KRAMER," For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later.  Well, somebody's baby-sitting.",160
20921,ELAINE, You? I'm more responsible than you are!,160
20922,KRAMER," Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.",160
20923,GEORGE," Oh, Tara!",160
20924,KRAMER," Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.",160
20925,ELAINE, Kramer...,160
20926,KRAMER, Don't take my money!,160
20927,ELAINE," It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.",160
20928,KRAMER," No, I'm the baby-sitter.",160
20929,ELAINE," No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.",160
20930,VIVIAN, Elaine? What are you doing here?,160
20931,ELAINE," Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out... what's that, some raccoon or something...",160
20932,VIVIAN," Well, I guess this would be all right. Jimmy, you remember Elaine? She's gonna watch you tonight.",160
20933,ELAINE, Hi Jimmy.  Ouch! ,160
20934,JERRY," Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.",160
20935,KRAMER, There was an incident.,160
20936,JERRY," Oh no, where's the blood?  It's in here isn't it?",160
20937,KRAMER, Would you stop it.,160
20938,JERRY, What is this?,160
20939,KRAMER, It's Jell-O.,160
20940,JERRY, What about this? This is blood isn't it?!,160
20941,KRAMER," This is tomato juice, look...",160
20942,JERRY," Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!",160
20943,KRAMER, Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.,160
20944,JERRY," Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding?",160
20945,KRAMER," Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.",160
20946,JERRY," Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...",160
20947,KRAMER, Heads up!,160
20948,JERRY, Aaah...,160
20949,JIMMY," You're dead, president Lincoln! You're dead!",160
20950,ELAINE, I wish I was dead.,160
20951,JIMMY, Can I have your juice?,160
20952,ELAINE, As long as you don't put...,160
20953,ELAINE, Thanks for the re-fill.,160
20954,VIVIAN," Hey, Elaine! How did it go?",160
20955,ELAINE," Oh, he's...he's a joy...",160
20956,VIVIAN, Really? Some sitter have told me he's bit of a handful.,160
20957,ELAINE," Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.",160
20958,VIVIAN," Oh Elaine, that's so good to hear. I've been having a few health problems lately.",160
20959,ELAINE," It's not serious, is it?",160
20960,VIVIAN," Well, it might be. Just in case anything does happen, it's nice to know there's somebody like you around.",160
20961,ELAINE," Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. ",160
20962,JERRY, Aah!,160
20963,KRAMER," It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.",160
20964,JERRY, I can see that! What happened?,160
20965,KRAMER," That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.",160
20966,JERRY, I'll remember that.,160
20967,KRAMER," Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.",160
20968,JERRY, What?,160
20969,KRAMER," Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.",160
20970,GEORGE, Three pints of Kramer's blood?,160
20971,JERRY, I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.,160
20972,GEORGE," Well, so much for purification week.",160
20973,JERRY," So, how's the fornicating gourmet?",160
20974,GEORGE," Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.",160
20975,JERRY," George, we're trying to have a civilization here.",160
20976,ELAINE, Hey.,160
20977,JERRY," Hey, how was baby-sitting?",160
20978,ELAINE," Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.",160
20979,JERRY," Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.",160
20980,ELAINE," It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.",160
20981,GEORGE," She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.",160
20982,JERRY, Really?,160
20983,KRAMER," Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?",160
20984,JERRY, I'm not touching that thing.,160
20985,KRAMER," Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.",160
20986,JERRY," Oh, no...",160
20987,KRAMER," What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse,  hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...",160
20988,JERRY," Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.",160
20989,KRAMER," So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!",160
20990,JERRY," All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.",160
20991,KRAMER," No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?",160
20992,JERRY, Hello?,160
20993,HELEN," Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.",160
20994,JERRY, Kramer called you?,160
20995,HELEN, He calls every week. Are you all right?,160
20996,JERRY," Yes, I'm fine.",160
20997,HELEN, He says he's fine.,160
20998,MORTY, Tell him to eat a plum.,160
20999,HELEN," Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.",160
21000,JERRY," I don't need a personal trainer.  all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.",160
21001,MORTY, Plum...,160
21002,JERRY, Why are you calling my parents?,160
21003,KRAMER," Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?",160
21004,JERRY, Why here?,160
21005,KRAMER," Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.",160
21006,JERRY, Ok...,160
21007,KRAMER," Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?",160
21008,JERRY, Fine...,160
21009,KRAMER, Ok!,160
21010,JERRY, No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!,160
21011,KRAMER, Blood!,160
21012,JERRY, All right.,160
21013,IZZY," Hello, dough boy.",160
21014,JERRY, Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?,160
21015,IZZY," I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need one. It's go-time.",160
21016,VIVIAN, Elaine? Elaine?,160
21017,ELAINE," Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.",160
21018,VIVIAN, Where's Jimmy?,160
21019,ELAINE," I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.",160
21020,VIVIAN," Sleeping like an angel. Elaine, you're the best.",160
21021,ELAINE, No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!,160
21022,VIVIAN," Be quiet. So, will you watch Jimmy tomorrow?",160
21023,ELAINE," All right, but I'm running out of purses here. ",160
21024,JERRY," Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?",160
21025,IZZY," Don't get puss honey, and pick up that medicine ball.",160
21026,JERRY," Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?",160
21027,IZZY," Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready?",160
21028,JERRY, For what?,160
21029,IZZY, All aboard in the pain train!,160
21030,JERRY, How many session did my parents paid for?,160
21031,IZZY," Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil.",160
21032,GEORGE," Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight!",160
21033,TARA," Oh, George!",160
21034,GEORGE, And now for the trifecta. ,160
21035,TARA, George? George? What are you doing?! ,160
21036,GEORGE, Pleasuring you?,160
21037,JERRY, What is this?,160
21038,KRAMER, We're making sausages.,160
21039,JERRY, I thought you were gonna watch a video.,160
21040,KRAMER," Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.",160
21041,JERRY," Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.",160
21042,KRAMER," All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.",160
21043,JERRY," Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.",160
21044,IZZY, Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae.  What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet?,160
21045,JERRY, No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...,160
21046,IZZY," Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch.",160
21047,JERRY," So, the free love buffet is over?",160
21048,GEORGE, I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.,160
21049,JERRY," Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.",160
21050,JERRY, What's going on?,160
21051,GEORGE, I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.,160
21052,JERRY," Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.",160
21053,GEORGE, I think you're right. You gonna eat that?,160
21054,JERRY," No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.",160
21055,ELAINE," Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.",160
21056,GEORGE, These fries are really really good...,160
21057,JERRY," All right, that's enough of that. ",160
21058,ELAINE," I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.",160
21059,GEORGE," Uuh, sleepy.",160
21060,ELAINE," No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.",160
21061,JERRY," Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.",160
21062,ELAINE," Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.",160
21063,KRAMER, Why did you get rid of that sausage?,160
21064,JERRY," It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.",160
21065,KRAMER," Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?",160
21066,JERRY, What's wrong with yours?,160
21067,KRAMER, I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.,160
21068,JERRY," All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!",160
21069,KRAMER," All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.",160
21070,KRAMER," Oh, man... ""If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner"". Never, I can't do that.",160
21071,KRAMER," Oh, mama...",160
21072,KRAMER," Shees, come on.....this thing is bone dry. ",160
21073,ELAINE, Vivian...,160
21074,VIVIAN, Elaine!,160
21075,ELAINE, Hi! This is my friend George.,160
21076,VIVIAN, Hi...,160
21077,ELAINE, I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.,160
21078,VIVIAN, Ok.,160
21079,ELAINE,  You're up.,160
21080,VIVIAN," Oh, isn't Elaine fantastic?",160
21081,GEORGE, Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.,160
21082,VIVIAN," Really, why?",160
21083,GEORGE," Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.",160
21084,VIVIAN, Her grandparent passed away five years ago.,160
21085,GEORGE, Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.,160
21086,VIVIAN," She's American citizen, I have seen her passport.",160
21087,GEORGE," All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.",160
21088,VIVIAN, I haven't heard anything about another Biosphere.,160
21089,GEORGE, That's because it's underwater.,160
21090,VIVIAN, This is insane.,160
21091,GEORGE, Is it?,160
21092,VIVIAN, Yes it it.,160
21093,GEORGE," Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.",160
21094,VIVIAN, You...very knowledgeable.,160
21095,GEORGE," Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?",160
21096,VIVIAN, Yes it is. I find the pastrami to be the most sensual of all the salted cured meats. Hungry?,160
21097,GEORGE, Very.,160
21098,VIVIAN," Oh, wait... Oohh...",160
21099,GEORGE, Vivian!!,160
21100,JERRY, Is this really necessary?,160
21101,IZZY," If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat.",160
21102,JERRY, What if I can't keep up?,160
21103,IZZY," You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son.",160
21104,IZZY JR.," Right dad, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...",160
21105,IZZY," Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it!",160
21106,JERRY, What's going on?,160
21107,IZZY JR., There's something wrong with your car. It's dripping something on my feet. Some kind of red liquid.,160
21108,JERRY," Oh my God, the blood!",160
21109,IZZY JR., Blood!!,160
21110,IZZY," Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it...",160
21111,ELAINE, So how long did they drag you?,160
21112,JERRY," Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.",160
21113,ELAINE, Hi George. Hi Jimmy.,160
21114,GEORGE," Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.",160
21115,GEORGE, Ouch!,160
21116,JERRY, What's the kid doing here?,160
21117,GEORGE, I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.,160
21118,JERRY," Oh, that's a drag...",160
21119,KRAMER, That kid...,160
21120,JERRY, You put blood in the car?!,160
21121,KRAMER," Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.",160
21122,JERRY," Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.",160
21123,KRAMER, You didn't get the blood from me.,160
21124,JERRY, Then who?,160
21125,NEWMAN, Hello Jerry.,160
21126,JERRY, Aaaaahhh...!!!,160
21127,JERRY,  Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.,161
21128,GEORGE,  Chinese food!,161
21129,JERRY,"  Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you.",161
21130,GEORGE, Who was it?,161
21131,JERRY, I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.,161
21132,GEORGE, What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?,161
21133,JERRY," No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.",161
21134,GEORGE, Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.,161
21135,JERRY, Why? He's harmless.,161
21136,GEORGE, Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.,161
21137,JERRY," He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.",161
21138,GEORGE, I made him up.,161
21139,JERRY, So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?,161
21140,GEORGE, No.,161
21141,JERRY, Too bad. It was erotic.,161
21142,KRAMER,  Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!,161
21143,JERRY, 'Pottery Barn'?,161
21144,KRAMER, I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.,161
21145,GEORGE,  Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?,161
21146,JERRY, Why don't you just throw 'em out?,161
21147,KRAMER," Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.",161
21148,JERRY,  Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?,161
21149,GEORGE, I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.,161
21150,JERRY, So call now.,161
21151,GEORGE," I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?",161
21152,JERRY, That's him.,161
21153,GEORGE, Is he still nuts?,161
21154,JERRY," What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?'",161
21155,PUDDY,"  Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had, or what?",161
21156,ELAINE, Mmm. De-lish.,161
21157,PUDDY, Delish?,161
21158,ELAINE," Delish. You know, short for delicious.",161
21159,PUDDY," Oh, like scrump.",161
21160,ELAINE, Yeah.,161
21161,PUDDY,  I'm gonna be late. See ya later.,161
21162,JACK," Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup?",161
21163,ELAINE,"  Oh, sure.",161
21164,JACK, Thank you.,161
21165,ESTELLE,  Hello?,161
21166,GEORGE," Hey, it's Georgie.",161
21167,ESTELLE, Let me put your father on the phone.,161
21168,GEORGE, Ma!,161
21169,FRANK, Who is this?,161
21170,GEORGE," Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.",161
21171,ESTELLE,  Chinese food.,161
21172,FRANK,"  Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. Talk to you later.",161
21173,GEORGE, Chinese food?,161
21174,KRAMER,"  Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?",161
21175,JERRY," So, maybe they had Chinese food?",161
21176,GEORGE," After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades.",161
21177,JERRY," Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.",161
21178,ELAINE,"  Well, gentlemen. Lainie is... in love.",161
21179,GEORGE," That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.",161
21180,ELAINE," Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.",161
21181,JERRY," It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?",161
21182,ELAINE," Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him?",161
21183,GEORGE," Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.",161
21184,JERRY," So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.",161
21185,ELAINE," Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.",161
21186,KRAMER,"  Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.",161
21187,JERRY, Stop the mail?,161
21188,KRAMER, That's... even better!,161
21189,FRANKIE, Jerry!,161
21190,JERRY," Hey, Frankie! So, where's the car?",161
21191,FRANKIE, This is it.,161
21192,JERRY, Inside the van?,161
21193,FRANKIE," It is the van! Don't you remember, we always talked about how cool it would be to have a van and just drive?",161
21194,JERRY, We were ten.,161
21195,FRANKIE, Come on. Let's take it for a spin.,161
21196,JERRY, I don't want a van.,161
21197,ELAINE," Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.",161
21198,JERRY," You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.",161
21199,ELAINE," Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'",161
21200,JERRY, Always helpful.,161
21201,ESTELLE," Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?",161
21202,GEORGE," Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back.",161
21203,ESTELLE, Uh... the phone broke.,161
21204,FRANK," Well, we got to get moving.",161
21205,GEORGE, What? Where are you going?,161
21206,FRANK, We have a catered affair.,161
21207,GEORGE, You're going like that?,161
21208,FRANK,"  It's creative black tie. Move, woman.",161
21209,GEORGE,  No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.,161
21210,JACK," Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late.",161
21211,JACK, I'm gonna be in the can.,161
21212,ELAINE," Okay, Jack.  Can I use your phone?",161
21213,CASHIER , Sure.,161
21214,FRANKIE,"  Nice captain's chairs, huh?",161
21215,JERRY," Aye, aye.",161
21216,FRANKIE," Oh, there's a spot. Just back up.",161
21217,JERRY, Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.,161
21218,FRANKIE," No, that's us.",161
21219,JERRY," Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?",161
21220,FRANKIE, You don't like the van?,161
21221,JERRY," No, no, no. Just hypothetically.",161
21222,FRANKIE, I gotta go to the park.,161
21223,JERRY," No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.",161
21224,KRAMER,"  Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.",161
21225,JERRY, Where'd you get the bricks?,161
21226,KRAMER," Jerry, the whole building is brick.",161
21227,JERRY, So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.,161
21228,KRAMER," A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.",161
21229,JERRY, I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.,161
21230,KRAMER," Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.",161
21231,JERRY, OK.,161
21232,KRAMER," All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'",161
21233,JERRY, I don't want to trade.,161
21234,KRAMER," No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.",161
21235,JERRY," Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now.",161
21236,KRAMER," Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.",161
21237,ELAINE," Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. ",161
21238,POSTAL EMPLOYEE, May I help you?,161
21239,KRAMER," Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.",161
21240,POSTAL EMPLOYEE, Certainly. How long would you like us to hold it?,161
21241,KRAMER," Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.",161
21242,NEWMAN," I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.",161
21243,KRAMER," Oh, yes, I am.",161
21244,NEWMAN, What about your bills?,161
21245,KRAMER, The bank can pay 'em.,161
21246,NEWMAN, The bank. What about your cards and letters?,161
21247,KRAMER," E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.",161
21248,NEWMAN," All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.",161
21249,SUPERVISOR," Is everything all right here, Postal Employee Newman?",161
21250,NEWMAN," Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?",161
21251,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!",161
21252,GEORGE,  Welcome back.,161
21253,ESTELLE, Oh!,161
21254,GEORGE, Quick for a... catered affair.,161
21255,FRANK, I don't know what you mean.,161
21256,GEORGE, You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!,161
21257,FRANK," George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son, but even parents have limits.",161
21258,ESTELLE," The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls.",161
21259,FRANK, What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time.,161
21260,GEORGE, I'm not following.,161
21261,FRANK, We're cuttin' you lose.,161
21262,GEORGE, You're cuttin' me loose?,161
21263,FRANK," Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother.",161
21264,GEORGE, They don't want to see me anymore!,161
21265,JERRY, But this is what you've always wanted.,161
21266,GEORGE, It is. I'm just not ready yet.,161
21267,JERRY," Aw, that's kind of sweet.",161
21268,GEORGE," Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.",161
21269,JERRY," Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?",161
21270,GEORGE, You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.,161
21271,JERRY, Mother of God.,161
21272,GEORGE," One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?",161
21273,JERRY," That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?",161
21274,JERRY, That is the guy!,161
21275,GEORGE, Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?,161
21276,JERRY," No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.",161
21277,GEORGE, That's pretty pathetic.,161
21278,JERRY, I know. They're not even related.,161
21279,ELAINE,  Hey.,161
21280,GEORGE, Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going.,161
21281,JERRY," Hey, have fun at the... family reunion.  So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?",161
21282,ELAINE, Isn't he the best?,161
21283,JERRY," Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?",161
21284,ELAINE," Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.",161
21285,JERRY,"  Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this?",161
21286,ELAINE," Oh, no.",161
21287,JERRY," Oh, yes.",161
21288,JERRY,"  Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy.",161
21289,KRAMER,"  Yeah, I called about the van.",161
21290,GEORGE,  Some more merlot?,161
21291,RHISA," Yeah, thanks.",161
21292,GEORGE," Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive.",161
21293,RHISA, What?,161
21294,GEORGE," I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.",161
21295,RHISA," You want to borrow money, right?",161
21296,GEORGE," No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.",161
21297,RHISA, All right.,161
21298,GEORGE, All right?,161
21299,RHISA, Let's go for it.,161
21300,GEORGE, Well... we could dance around it a little first.,161
21301,RHISA,"  Nah. Let's be bad, George. Let's be really... bad.",161
21302,GEORGE, Whoa! Whoa! Geez!,161
21303,KRAMER,"  So, how come you're selling it?",161
21304,JERRY, You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.,161
21305,KRAMER, How many miles?,161
21306,JERRY, Two.,161
21307,KRAMER, City or highway?,161
21308,JERRY," Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?",161
21309,KRAMER,"  Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that.",161
21310,JERRY," All right, just get out of here.",161
21311,KRAMER," All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van.",161
21312,JERRY," OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?'",161
21313,KRAMER,"  Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.",161
21314,JERRY, You put that in!,161
21315,KRAMER,  And I'm glad I did. Here.,161
21316,JERRY, You want to trade me an undershirt?,161
21317,KRAMER," No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.",161
21318,JERRY, That's disgusting.,161
21319,KRAMER," Well, it's my final offer.",161
21320,PUDDY, You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.,161
21321,ELAINE," Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.",161
21322,PUDDY," Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman.",161
21323,ELAINE, You're not taking me back?,161
21324,PUDDY,  That's right.,161
21325,ELAINE, He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...,161
21326,KRAMER,"  Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.",161
21327,WOMAN, Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?,161
21328,KRAMER, Because we're blind to their tyranny.,161
21329,WOMAN, Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket?,161
21330,KRAMER," Yeah. Move along, Betty.",161
21331,FRANKIE," Is this, uh, Jerry Seinfeld's van?",161
21332,KRAMER," Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.",161
21333,FRANKIE," I'm, uh, I'm so stupid.",161
21334,KRAMER, What?,161
21335,FRANKIE,"  I'm so stupid. Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry.",161
21336,KRAMER," Yeah, nice to meet you.",161
21337,JERRY, She's into it?,161
21338,GEORGE, She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.,161
21339,JERRY, So have your parents found out about it?,161
21340,GEORGE, She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.,161
21341,JERRY," Brave new world, alright.",161
21342,KRAMER,"  Hey, you guys.",161
21343,JERRY," Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?",161
21344,KRAMER," Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in.",161
21345,JERRY, It's Sunday.,161
21346,GEORGE, Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?,161
21347,KRAMER," Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution.",161
21348,GEORGE, Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket.,161
21349,JERRY," Hey, I want my van keys back.",161
21350,KRAMER," Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.",161
21351,JERRY, Are you insane? Give 'em to me.,161
21352,KRAMER," No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.",161
21353,GEORGE," Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.",161
21354,KRAMER," Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.",161
21355,JERRY," Oh, no, not Frankie.",161
21356,KRAMER," Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.",161
21357,JERRY," Oh, no, the woods! The hole!",161
21358,KRAMER,  Hey.,161
21359,NEWMAN," Kramer, what the hell are you doing?",161
21360,KRAMER," I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.",161
21361,NEWMAN, Not that!,161
21362,KRAMER, What?,161
21363,NEWMAN," You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen",161
21364,KRAMER, Are you through?,161
21365,NEWMAN, No! And no one will ever see you again!,161
21366,KRAMER, Are you through?,161
21367,NEWMAN," Yes. No, wait! OK, yes.",161
21368,NEWMAN,  Quick! Get in!,161
21369,KRAMER," Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.",161
21370,NEWMAN," There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!",161
21371,KRAMER," No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!",161
21372,NEWMAN," I know you know, but you don't know what I know.",161
21373,KRAMER,  Hey!,161
21374,JERRY," Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?",161
21375,HOLE DIGGER, My name is Edgar.,161
21376,JERRY, Have a nice night.,161
21377,HOLE DIGGER, Thank you.,161
21378,FRANKIE,  Stupid... so stupid! Jerry?,161
21379,RHISA," All right, George. I'm ready.",161
21380,GEORGE," Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?",161
21381,RHISA, Geor-gie...,161
21382,FRANKIE,  Is this Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van?!,161
21383,RHISA,  Wait. What's he saying?,161
21384,GEORGE," I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!",161
21385,RHISA," No, they caught him.",161
21386,GEORGE,  I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!,161
21387,FRANKIE,  Ohh...,161
21388,ELAINE," So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'",161
21389,JACK," Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today.",161
21390,ELAINE," Really, what was the first?",161
21391,JACK,  They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz again.,161
21392,ELAINE, What?,161
21393,JACK,  I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!,161
21394,ELAINE," Well what, what about your fact-checking job?",161
21395,JACK,"  Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and noooobody beats me!",161
21396,JERRY,  Frankie... come on out of there.,161
21397,FRANKIE, You hate the van.,161
21398,JERRY," But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.",161
21399,FRANKIE," So, can we go for a ride?",161
21400,JERRY," Yeah, let's just get out of here.",161
21401,FRANK,  Good. He left the door unlocked.,161
21402,ESTELLE, Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?,161
21403,FRANK, Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here.,161
21404,ESTELLE,  Wow!,161
21405,FRANK,"  Hey, look at this. Hoochie mama!",161
21406,POSTMASTER GENERAL," Oh, my goodness. What have they done to you here?",161
21407,KRAMER, Huh? Who are you?,161
21408,POSTMASTER GENERAL," Well, you can just call me Henry.",161
21409,KRAMER, Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?,161
21410,POSTMASTER GENERAL, Last time I checked.,161
21411,KRAMER, Henry... can I get out of here now?,161
21412,POSTMASTER GENERAL," Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean, after all, I drove all the way up here from D.C. just to talk to you.",161
21413,KRAMER, Oh?,161
21414,POSTMASTER GENERAL," I even had to cancel a round of golf with the secretary of state. Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer?",161
21415,KRAMER, Yeah.,161
21416,POSTMASTER GENERAL," Kramer, I've been, uh, reading some of your material here. I gotta be honest with you",161
21417,KRAMER, Yeah! Ha ha.,161
21418,POSTMASTER GENERAL," Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn serious about it. In addition to being a postmaster, I'm a general. And we both know, it's the job of a general to, by God, get things done. So maybe you can understand why I get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf.",161
21419,KRAMER," I'm very, very sorry.",161
21420,POSTMASTER GENERAL," Sure, you're sorry. I think we got a stack of mail out at the desk that belongs to you. Now, you want that mail, don't you Mr. Kramer?",161
21421,KRAMER, Sure do!,161
21422,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"  Now, that's better.",161
21423,KRAMER,  Geez. Newman?,161
21424,NEWMAN,  Tell the world my story.,161
21425,JERRY," Hey, George!",161
21426,GEORGE," Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!",161
21427,JERRY," What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman.",161
21428,GEORGE, Oh. The summer me.,161
21429,FRANKIE, The winter me.,161
21430,JERRY, You must be George's cousin.,161
21431,RHISA, Girlfriend.,161
21432,JERRY, All right.,161
21433,GEORGE,  What is that? That van's a-rockin'.,161
21434,JERRY, Don't go a-knockin'.,161
21435,ESTELLE,"  Oh, my god!",161
21436,GEORGE,"  Oh, my god!",161
21437,FRANKIE, Now you gotta sell this van.,161
21438,JERRY," Oh, yeah.",161
21439,FRANK, What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady.,161
21440,GEORGE, Ohhhh...,161
21441,ESTELLE, Your father's right. It's beautiful.,161
21442,FRANK, And it was safe.,161
21443,GEORGE," Oh, God...",161
21444,FRANK," Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I...",161
21445,GEORGE, Oh... make it stop.,161
21446,JERRY, I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.,162
21447,KRAMER, Well what’s the difference -- Come on  -- were like Cain and Able.,162
21448,JERRY," Yeah, ya know Cain slew Able.",162
21449,KRAMER," No he didn’t. They were in business together… it was dry wall, or somethin’.",162
21450,JERRY," Oh, no.",162
21451,KRAMER," All right then, what was it?",162
21452,JERRY," Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.",162
21453,KRAMER," The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.",162
21454,JERRY," Ya broke my blender, didn’t ya?",162
21455,KRAMER, Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just  just didn’t work out.,162
21456,JERRY, I knew it.,162
21457,JERRY, Why were you making gravel?,162
21458,KRAMER, Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.,162
21459,KRAMER," Aahh, this looks familiar…",162
21460,JERRY, Of course. It's garbage.,162
21461,KRAMER," No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs.  Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show!  They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!",162
21462,JERRY," Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.",162
21463,KRAMER," Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.",162
21464,JERRY," Come on, Kramer, get out of there.",162
21465,KRAMER," No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.",162
21466,JERRY,  Ohhh ,162
21467,GEORGE," You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya?",162
21468,MIRANDA, Banana?,162
21469,GEORGE, Right.,162
21470,MIRANDA, George watch out for those pigeons.,162
21471,GEORGE, Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?,162
21472,MIRANDA,  Oh my God. ,162
21473,GEORGE, So uh… where we eating?,162
21474,JERRY, And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.,162
21475,CELIA, You're making this up. There was never a Joseph Garnish.,162
21476,JERRY, Wow! ,162
21477,CELIA, Oh yeah the toys.,162
21478,JERRY, Where did you get all these?,162
21479,CELIA, My dad was a collector. I inherited them after he died from a long painful bout with…,162
21480,JERRY," Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe.  With a full frogman suit.",162
21481,CELIA," Jerry, what are you doing?",162
21482,JERRY, I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.,162
21483,CELIA, Ohhh Jerry.  They're priceless. They've never been played with.,162
21484,JERRY," I just want a, touch ‘em a little.",162
21485,CELIA, I said no. Now come here.,162
21486,LOU, Hi  I'm Lou Filerman. I'm new here.,162
21487,ELAINE," Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?",162
21488,WALTER, uh-He's Lou Filerman. He's new here.,162
21489,ELAINE, ,162
21490,WALTER, Hey your coffee stain looks like Fidel Castro.,162
21491,ELAINE, You've been an enormous help.													 ,162
21492,JERRY, You ran over some pigeons? How many?,162
21493,GEORGE, What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?,162
21494,JERRY," Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.",162
21495,GEORGE, Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!,162
21496,JERRY, So Miranda's cooled on ya?,162

21508,JERRY, So he just sidles up?,162
21509,ELAINE, That's right! He's a real sidler. ,162
21510,JERRY, Maybe you just didn't see him.,162
21511,ELAINE," Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from ""The Lion King"".",162
21512,JERRY, Hakuna Matata?,162
21513,ELAINE, I thought I was alone.,162
21514,JERRY, That doesn't make it right.,162
21515,JERRY," See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...",162
21516,ELAINE," Would you just, let it go?",162
21517,KRAMER,"  Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!",162

21524,KRAMER, Yeah ... backstage.,162
21525,ELAINE, Ehnn! This chair smells like garbage.,162
21526,KRAMER,"  Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.",162
21527,JERRY, I'm gonna get that. ,162
21528,KRAMER," All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. ",162
21529,KRAMER," Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you!  Boy, is it possible that you’re even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?",162

21535,JERRY, So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.,162
21536,KRAMER," Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.",162
21537,JERRY," Yeah, that was me.",162
21538,KRAMER," Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an…",162
21539,JERRY, An Army Pete.,162
21540,KRAMER, Right.,162
21541,JERRY, He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.,162
21542,KRAMER, And we all know how painful that can be. ,162
21543,ELAINE, Jerry. Oh there - -,162
21544,KRAMER," Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - -  Come on sit down. Yes.",162

21546,KRAMER," Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way.",162
21547,ELAINE," Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.",162
21548,KRAMER," Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?",162
21549,ELAINE," Kramer, what is wrong with you?",162
21550,KRAMER, What do you mean?,162
21551,ELAINE," Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards",162
21552,ELAINE,"  I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.",162
21553,JERRY," You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!",162
21554,ELAINE, Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!,162
21555,KRAMER,  Only in New York. ... ha ha,162

21562,KRAMER," Eyaaaya-ya-ya, I'll ask the questions. What happened?",162
21563,GEORGE, Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.,162
21564,KRAMER," All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah.  Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like?",162
21565,KRAMER, That was the wrong card.,162
21566,GEORGE, I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!,162
21567,JERRY, So they're like everyone else.,162
21568,KRAMER,"  All right, let's take a short break.",162
21569,KRAMER," … Okay ah,  We're back!",162
21570,GEORGE, Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off.,162
21571,MIRANDA, Then why don't you just run IT over too?,162
21572,GEORGE, Zing.,162
21573,MIRANDA," George, what are you doing?",162
21574,GEORGE, Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!,162
21575,MIRANDA, What pigeon? You drove right into that squirrel. ,162
21576,GEORGE," Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!",162
21577,JERRY,"  Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!",162
21578,CELIA, Jerry!  … Those hands! They never stop!,162
21579,JERRY, I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!,162
21580,CELIA, No. Thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin?,162
21581,JERRY, All right.,162
21582,JERRY," Ohh, will not “cause drowsiness""",162
21583,LOU, Here's the new copy you wanted.,162
21584,PETERMAN," Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you.",162
21585,ELAINE,  Thank you. ha ha ha ha. ,162
21586,PETERMAN," Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away.",162
21587,ELAINE," Well, I guess we'll just have -  Ohh, just gimme that. ",162
21588,JERRY," Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer… A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe.  dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de ",162
21589,MIRANDA, Doctor is the squirrel going to live?,162
21590,DOCTOR," There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.",162
21591,GEORGE," Well, uh, are there any other options?",162
21592,DOCTOR," We, could put him to sleep.",162
21593,GEORGE, What might that cost?,162
21594,DOCTOR, Well it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents.,162
21595,GEORGE," Well?  I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible.",162
21596,DOCTOR," He, um. He's not going to be the same, you know?",162
21597,GEORGE, Yeah. yeah. I-I know.,162
21598,GEORGE, So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.,162
21599,KRAMER, El Paso? I spent a month there one night.,162
21600,NEWMAN,  El Paso!,162
21601,JERRY, What's he here for?,162
21602,NEWMAN, eue-aaa.,162
21603,KRAMER," Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm.",162
21604,JERRY," Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.",162
21605,KRAMER," Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?",162
21606,NEWMAN, Are you married right now? ,162
21607,KRAMER, Newman. ,162
21608,JERRY," Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!",162
21609,KRAMER," What do you mean ""wrong kind of medicine""?",162
21610,JERRY, She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!,162
21611,GEORGE," Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!",162
21612,KRAMER," Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment.  Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!",162
21613,NEWMAN, I told you he was a risk.,162
21614,JERRY," Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!",162
21615,NEWMAN," Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!",162
21616,KRAMER," Smile, everyone! We're back!",162
21617,LOU," You wanted to see me, Elaine?",162
21618,ELAINE," Yes, Lou.  You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ...  Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...",162
21619,LOU, My dead tooth?,162
21620,ELAINE, No. Your. ,162
21621,LOU, Not my breath?,162
21622,ELAINE, Uuhhh.,162
21623,LOU, What can I do?,162
21624,ELAINE," Well, you should never ever go anywhere,  without these.",162
21625,LOU," Thanks, Elaine. You're such a super lady! ",162
21626,GEORGE, More wine and turkey? ,162
21627,CELIA, Hmm. ,162
21628,JERRY," So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought",162
21629,CELIA, What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy?,162
21630,CELIA, Ahh.,162
21631,JERRY, ... I think. Have some more wine. ,162
21632,CELIA, What video did you get?,162
21633,GEORGE, Oh.,162
21634,JERRY," Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.",162
21635,GEORGE, Four hours.,162
21636,JERRY, More heavy gravy?,162
21637,GEORGE,"  Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. ",162
21638,NEWMAN," Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label… I can hardly tell the difference.",162
21639,KRAMER," We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?",162
21640,NEWMAN, We got no one!,162
21641,KRAMER, We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.,162
21642,NEWMAN, What about a guest-host?,162
21643,KRAMER, I'll pretend I didn't hear that.,162
21644,MIRANDA," Doctor, how's the squirrel?",162
21645,GEORGE, Is he dead?,162
21646,DOCTOR," No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?",162
21647,MIRANDA, Yes he would.,162
21648,DOCTOR," You uh, You have 30 minutes. ",162
21649,GEORGE," So ... uh, squirrel.",162
21650,DOCTOR," One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.",162
21651,GEORGE, What's that?,162
21652,DOCTOR," Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home.",162
21653,GEORGE, He has no home. He's a squirrel.,162
21654,DOCTOR," Hmm-hm. Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated. ",162
21655,JERRY, Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.,162
21656,GEORGE," It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!",162
21657,KRAMER," Jerry,  aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.",162
21658,JERRY," What about my ""questionable material""?",162
21659,KRAMER," Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!",162
21660,JERRY," Jim Fowler? The animal guy from ""Wild Kingdom"" is coming to your apartment?",162
21661,KRAMER," Well, I practically raised his kids.",162
21662,GEORGE, That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?,162
21663,KRAMER," What? Two animal acts on the same show?  What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? ",162
21664,GEORGE, I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!,162
21665,ELAINE," Hey!  ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think I’ve got that problem, solved.",162
21666,JERRY, Tic-Tacs work?,162
21667,ELAINE, He's a human maraca.,162
21668,GEORGE," Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.",162
21669,ELAINE, You took him over to Celia's?,162
21670,JERRY, What? It's a victimless crime.,162
21671,ELAINE, What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?,162
21672,JERRY," Okay, one victim.",162
21673,ELAINE, I think it's unconscionable.,162
21674,GEORGE," Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.",162
21675,ELAINE, EZ Bake oven?,162
21676,ELAINE, Who wants cupcake?,162
21677,GEORGE," Oh, me, me, me, me, me!",162
21678,JERRY," You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.",162
21679,FRANK,  You step on it and it flushes.,162
21680,ELAINE, Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?,162
21681,ESTELLE,  Stop squirming.,162
21682,GEORGE," Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.",162
21683,JERRY, You're like eight years old.,162
21684,ESTELLE,  Georgie.,162
21685,GEORGE, I was seven and a half.,162
21686,PETERMAN, That noise. That's the noise!,162
21687,ELAINE, What?,162
21688,PETERMAN," That infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. Even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine!",162
21689,ELAINE," No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!",162
21690,PETERMAN, That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?,162
21691,ELAINE, No Mister Peterman.,162
21692,PETERMAN," Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too. ",162
21693,ELAINE,  Lou! In here!  We have to talk.,162
21694,LOU," Oh, right.",162
21695,ELAINE,"  Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.",162
21696,LOU, Why?,162
21697,ELAINE, Because they're turning your teeth green?,162
21698,LOU, I only buy the white ones.,162
21699,ELAINE," O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.",162
21700,LOU, I can't. It burns my cankers.,162
21701,ELAINE, Binaca?,162
21702,LOU, Again.,162
21703,ELAINE," Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!",162
21704,LOU, I hate gum. The only guy I ever liked came with the Mickey Mouse gumball machine. They stopped making that 20 years ago.,162
21705,ELAINE," Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.",162
21706,KRAMER," Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.",162
21707,FOWLER, Where are the cameras? ,162
21708,KRAMER," But first, we're talking with, Jerry.  Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?",162
21709,JERRY, It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.,162
21710,KRAMER," And she doesn't know anything, about this?",162
21711,JERRY," No, not a thing.",162
21712,KRAMER," Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!",162
21713,CELIA, What kind of a sick twisted creep are you?,162
21714,JERRY," What, What is this? What is she doing here?",162
21715,KRAMER, It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.,162
21716,CELIA," If you think you can drug me and play with my toys, you got another thing coming, buddy!",162
21717,NEWMAN, Go girl!,162
21718,JERRY," Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?",162
21719,GEORGE," Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! ",162
21720,KRAMER, George I told you we're booked!,162
21721,FOWLER, Careful. Hawks and squirrels don't get along together.,162
21722,KRAMER," Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.",162
21723,GEORGE, Uh.,162
21724,FOWLER," No, you idiot! Hawks eat squirrels!",162
21725,GEORGE," Ahhhh, Ahh, Ah, Ahhh, Ahh, Ah!",162
21726,KRAMER,  Are we getting this?,162
21727,JERRY, So the whole set was destroyed?,162
21728,KRAMER," Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.",162
21729,GEORGE," Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry ‘bout the set.",162
21730,KRAMER, I’ll tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.,162
21731,MIRANDA," I got the nut bread, George. Let's go. ",162
21732,JERRY, So the squirrel's gonna make it?,162
21733,GEORGE," Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm… sleeping on the couch.",162
21734,JERRY, On the couch? So you're...,162
21735,GEORGE, Still getting nothing!,162
21736,GEORGE, So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!,162
21737,CELIA," I'm glad you called, Elaine. I really needed to talk to someone.",162
21738,ELAINE," Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?",162
21739,CELIA, Who's he? ,162
21740,ELAINE," Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. ",162
21741,ELAINE, Hey.,163

21743,ELAINE," Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.",163
21744,JERRY, But why?,163
21745,ELAINE, I need some space.,163
21746,GEORGE, Does that mean I have to go too?,163
21747,JERRY, You don't think she's just talking to me?,163
21748,GEORGE," Hey, shut up.",163
21749,JERRY, You shut up.,163
21750,ELAINE, I hate this.,163
21751,KRAMER, You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.,163
21752,ELAINE," No, I don't want this anymore.",163
21753,JERRY, We'll come to work with you.,163
21754,GEORGE, And on your dates.,163

21758,ELAINE,  Turn your alarm off!! ,163
21759,KRUGER," Your background is impressive George, but how does it apply to what we do here, at Kruger Industrial Smoothing?",163
21760,GEORGE," Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.",163
21761,KRUGER, It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days?,163
21762,GEORGE," That should be 14, let me just...",163
21763,KRUGER," George, I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but what the hell, we need someone, huh.",163
21764,GEORGE," You won't regret this, sir.",163
21765,KRUGER, I don't care. Let's find you an office.,163
21766,GEORGE,...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.,163
21767,JERRY, The boom box incident?,163
21768,GEORGE," Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.",163
21769,JERRY, Seems reasonable.,163
21770,GEORGE," Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.",163
21771,JERRY, Even more reasonable.,163
21772,GEORGE," So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.",163
21773,JERRY, And that guy is your new boss?,163
21774,GEORGE, Until that stupid photo jogs his memory.,163
21775,KRAMER," Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?",163
21776,GEORGE, Yeah.,163
21777,KRAMER," Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.",163
21778,JERRY," Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.",163
21779,GEORGE, It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.,163
21780,KRAMER, You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.,163
21781,GEORGE, Like retouched.,163
21782,KRAMER, You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.,163
21783,GEORGE," Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.",163
21784,KRAMER," Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...",163
21785,KRAMER, I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.,163
21786,JERRY, Neither have I.,163
21787,KRAMER," Hey, our meat problems are solved.",163
21788,JERRY, Where did you get this thing?,163
21789,KRAMER," I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.",163
21790,ELAINE, Hey.,163
21791,KRAMER," Hey, spice.  Welcome to flavor country.",163
21792,ELAINE," Yeah, that's pretty good.",163
21793,JERRY," Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.",163
21794,ELAINE, Sara Sitarides?,163
21795,JERRY, Mmhu.,163
21796,ELAINE, Oh...,163
21797,JERRY, What's with you?,163
21798,ELAINE," You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?",163
21799,JERRY, Your whole building smells like potatoes.,163
21800,ELAINE," This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 3",163
21801,KRAMER," You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.",163
21802,ELAINE, How do you do that?,163
21803,KRAMER," Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.",163
21804,JERRY, I think we might have one left in the stock room.,163
21805,KRAMER, This hallway smells like potatoes.,163
21806,ELAINE," I know, I know, this is it. ",163
21807,KRAMER," Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...",163
21808,ELAINE, I think I'll let you do it.,163
21809,KRAMER," No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.",163
21810,ELAINE," No, I really don't want to.",163
21811,KRAMER," Well, I don't want to either.",163
21812,ELAINE, I thought you had done this before.,163
21813,KRAMER, It's just...it's no picnic.,163
21814,ELAINE," Well, how are we gonna do it?",163
21815,KRAMER," Alright, fine fine, I'll do it.",163
21816,KRAMER, Oh mama.,163
21817,ELAINE, Are you okay?,163
21818,KRAMER, I will lose that nail.,163
21819,SARA, I enjoy the challenge of medicine. Naturally you have no idea what it's like to have someone's life depending on you.,163
21820,JERRY," Well, I have this neighbor...",163
21821,SARA, A joke. Do you have any idea how it feels like to save someone's life?,163
21822,JERRY, Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?,163
21823,SARA, No.,163
21824,JERRY, Cause I hit a whopper last week!,163
21825,CLERK," Here you go, airbrushed in to sand and sky.",163
21826,GEORGE, What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.,163
21827,CLERK, I thought you said you wanted to be out?,163
21828,GEORGE," Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!",163
21829,CLERK, You've really lost a lot of hair.,163
21830,GEORGE, I am aware!,163
21831,ELAINE, The cat.,163
21832,JERRY, He took out Kruger?,163
21833,GEORGE, I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.,163
21834,KRAMER, This slicer is indomitable.,163
21835,JERRY, Where did you get that butcher's coat?,163
21836,KRAMER," You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.",163
21837,ELAINE," Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.",163
21838,KRAMER," See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.",163
21839,ELAINE, What did he do about it?,163
21840,KRAMER," Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.",163
21841,ELAINE," Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.",163
21842,KRAMER," Oh, that's a prickly one.",163
21843,ELAINE," Yeah, how's the doctor date?",163
21844,JERRY," Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.",163
21845,ELAINE," Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.",163
21846,JERRY, Dermatology?,163
21847,ELAINE," Yes, she's a dermatologist.",163
21848,JERRY," Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.",163
21849,KRAMER," The slicer! Elaine, let's go.",163
21850,ELAINE, Where are we going?,163
21851,KRAMER, The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.,163
21852,GEORGE, When are you going on your next date with her?,163
21853,JERRY," Oh, what's the point?",163
21854,GEORGE," What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?",163
21855,JERRY, Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.,163
21856,GEORGE," This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!",163
21857,JERRY, Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor!,163
21858,GEORGE," Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!",163
21859,JERRY, You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.,163
21860,GEORGE," No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...",163
21861,JERRY, Flowers?,163
21862,GEORGE," Yeah, you gotta do it classy ",163
21863,JERRY," So, you've done this?",163
21864,GEORGE, Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.,163
21865,KRAMER, I think we are looking half a millimeter.,163
21866,ELAINE, Can it cut that thin?,163
21867,KRAMER," Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.",163
21868,ELAINE, How did you know you cut it?,163
21869,KRAMER," Well, I guess I just assumed.",163
21870,ELAINE," Hold on kitty, dinner's coming.",163
21871,KRAMER," Yeah, that's a hall of famer.",163
21872,ELAINE," Alright, let's do it.",163
21873,KRAMER," Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...",163
21874,ELAINE," Come on, come on kitty... ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?",163
21875,KRAMER," Oh no, I don't think so.",163
21876,ELAINE, Why not?,163
21877,KRAMER," Well, you're not checked at on it.",163
21878,ELAINE, What do I have to know?,163
21879,KRAMER," Well, where the meat goes?",163
21880,ELAINE, Right there.,163
21881,KRAMER, Where do you turn it on?,163
21882,ELAINE, Right there.,163
21883,KRAMER, But where does the meat go?,163
21884,SARA," Restaurant, flowers...this is so nice.",163
21885,JERRY," Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?",163
21886,SARA, It's fine.,163
21887,JERRY," It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!",163
21888,SARA, What is with you?,163
21889,JERRY, You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!,163
21890,PARRY, Dr. Sitarides?,163
21891,SARA," Mr. Parry, how are you?",163
21892,PARRY, I just wanted to thank you again for saving my life.,163
21893,JERRY, She saved your life?,163
21894,PARRY, I had skin cancer.,163
21895,JERRY, Skin cancer! Damn.,163
21896,ELAINE," You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.													",163
21897,ELAINE, These heals are so uneven. ,163
21898,CLERK, Here you Mr. Costanza.,163
21899,GEORGE, What is this? This is a drawing.,163
21900,CLERK," Looks real, doesn't it?",163
21901,GEORGE, This is a cartoon!,163
21902,CLERK," Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering, I think that's damn good.",163
21903,GEORGE," But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!",163
21904,CLERK, Then you better get a camera.,163
21905,JERRY, He looks like a Peanuts character.,163
21906,GEORGE," I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.",163
21907,JERRY, You can do that.,163
21908,GEORGE, Without his shirt on.,163
21909,JERRY," You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.",163
21910,GEORGE, It seemed so disorganized.,163
21911,JERRY, I understand.,163
21912,GEORGE," What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.",163
21913,JERRY," True. You mean, for you?",163
21914,GEORGE, I think.,163
21915,JERRY, What about your sea sickness?,163
21916,GEORGE, Maybe I could be a land guy.,163
21917,JERRY, I don't know if they have land guys.,163
21918,GEORGE, Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!,163
21919,ELAINE, Pliers?,163
21920,JERRY, Drawer.,163
21921,ELAINE, Got it.,163
21922,JERRY, What are they for?,163
21923,ELAINE, I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.,163
21924,JERRY, Come again?,163
21925,ELAINE," Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.",163
21926,GEORGE, I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?,163
21927,JERRY," Eh, it went okay.",163
21928,GEORGE," Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?",163
21929,JERRY," Yeah, I started out real classy...",163
21930,GEORGE," Yeah you did, you classed it up!",163
21931,JERRY, But then I found out about the skin cancer.,163
21932,GEORGE," Oh, so it backfired?",163
21933,JERRY, Yeah.,163
21934,GEORGE," So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.",163
21935,ELAINE," Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.",163
21936,JERRY," Sadly, that knowledge could've help me.",163
21937,GEORGE," Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?",163
21938,ELAINE, Aha.,163
21939,GEORGE, Could she do that at Kruger?,163
21940,ELAINE," I don't know, I guess.",163
21941,GEORGE," So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.",163
21942,ELAINE, You have a little thing for this fella'?,163
21943,GEORGE," Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.",163
21944,JERRY, Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!,163
21945,GEORGE," And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..",163
21946,JERRY, Must I?,163
21947,GEORGE," Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.",163
21948,JERRY, How does that reflect me?,163
21949,KRAMER," Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.",163
21950,ELAINE," Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.",163
21951,KRAMER," Ok, I'll go with you.",163
21952,ELAINE," Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.",163
21953,KRAMER," Oh, well you have fun... oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.",163
21954,JERRY," So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...",163
21955,SARA," Jerry, enough. I'll do your friend's cancer screening, because I believe in that, but as far as you and I are concerned; it's off.",163
21956,JERRY, Was it pimple popper MD?,163
21957,SARA, That's the one. ,163
21958,JERRY, Still got it.,163
21959,ELAINE," Out, damn heal!",163
21960,KRAMER, Elaine?,163
21961,ELAINE, Kramer?,163
21962,KRAMER," Yeah listen, I need my slicer back.",163
21963,ELAINE, Just hold on!,163
21964,KRAMER," Hey, what's going on?",163
21965,ELAINE," Nothing... Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...",163
21966,KRAMER," My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!",163
21967,ELAINE, Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!,163
21968,KRAMER," Come on, this is important! ",163
21969,NEIGHBOR," Hey, get the hell out of here!",163
21970,KRAMER," Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.",163
21971,KRAMER," So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.",163
21972,JERRY, What the hell is this?,163
21973,KRAMER," Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?",163
21974,JERRY, No.,163
21975,KRAMER," Well, what have you been doing?",163
21976,JERRY," Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...",163
21977,KRAMER," Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?",163
21978,JERRY," Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...",163
21979,KRAMER," There, there's your hives.",163
21980,JERRY," What, she gave me hives?",163
21981,KRAMER," Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.",163
21982,JERRY, She did kind of touch my face.,163
21983,KRAMER," Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.",163
21984,JERRY, It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.,163
21985,KRAMER," Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.",163
21986,ELAINE," Oh, that's fantastic.",163
21987,GEORGE," I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.",163
21988,SARA, What record?,163
21989,GEORGE," His personal file, I, I don't ask...",163
21990,SARA, Jerry? What brings you here?,163
21991,JERRY," I don't know, this? ",163
21992,SARA, Looks like hives.,163
21993,JERRY, Where do you suppose that could've come from?,163
21994,GEORGE," Jerry, what are you doing...",163
21995,KRAMER, He is just setting the record straight.,163
21996,JERRY," Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?",163
21997,SARA, Are you suggesting I somehow I infected you on purpose?,163
21998,JERRY," I want the antidote, pimple popper!",163
21999,SARA," That's it, I'm out of here! You're insane.",163
22000,JERRY, Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!,163
22001,GEORGE," Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry!",163
22002,KRUGER," Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here?",163
22003,GEORGE," Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.",163
22004,KRAMER," Doc, huh?",163
22005,GEORGE," Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.",163
22006,KRAMER," Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin.",163
22007,GEORGE," And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.",163
22008,KRAMER," You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?",163
22009,GEORGE," Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...",163
22010,ELAINE, This is it. I can take this anymore.,163
22011,KRAMER," Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.",163
22012,KRUGER, How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand?,163
22013,KRAMER," Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.",163
22014,KRUGER," So, how am I looking?",163
22015,KRAMER," Oh, so far, so good... yeuye...",163
22016,GEORGE," Kramer, I really owe you one.",163
22017,KRAMER," George, we got a problem.",163
22018,GEORGE, What?,163
22019,KRAMER," Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.",163
22020,GEORGE," So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.",163
22021,KRAMER," George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?",163
22022,GEORGE," Because, you're not a dermatologist.",163
22023,KRAMER, He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...,163
22024,GEORGE," Whoa, whoa, a section?!",163
22025,KRAMER," Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...",163
22026,GEORGE," No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...",163
22027,KRAMER," It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.",163
22028,GEORGE, No! Absolutely Not!,163
22029,KRAMER," Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.",163
22030,ELAINE," Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!",163
22031,NEIGHBOR, Turn it off! Turn it off!,163
22032,ELAINE," I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!",163
22033,NEIGHBOR," Alright, that's it!",163
22034,ELAINE," Yeah, the address is 78th West...",163
22035,NEIGHBOR," Oh, oh mama...",163
22036,JERRY," So, Kramer pulled it off?",163
22037,GEORGE," Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.",163
22038,JERRY," Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!",163
22039,GEORGE, Why don't you see someone about it?,163
22040,JERRY, I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town?  A real dermatologist.,163
22041,KRAMER,  Squamous cell carcinoma.,163
22042,GEORGE, You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.,163
22043,KRAMER," George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.",163
22044,GEORGE," You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.",163
22045,KRAMER, I don't want this on my conscience.,163
22046,GEORGE, I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.,163
22047,KRAMER," Yeah, alright...",163

22049,KRAMER," They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.",163

22052,JERRY, What are you doing?,163
22053,KRAMER," Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.",163
22054,JERRY," That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!",163
22055,KRAMER," So, somehow the Bronzo  is reacting to the poison she's giving you.",163

22060,KRUGER, I'm not too worried about it.,163
22061,GEORGE," Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.",163
22062,KRUGER," George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern, eh?",163
22063,GEORGE, Whatever.,163
22064,KRUGER," Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear shaped loser.",163
22065,GEORGE," Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!",163

22071,JERRY, I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.,163
22072,GEORGE," He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?",163
22073,JERRY," Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.",163
22074,GEORGE, What did he give you for it.,163

22329,ZUBIN, I'm Zubin.,164
22330,ELAINE,"  Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.",164
22331,USHA," You're not going to the wedding, are you?",164
22332,ELAINE, Well ...,164
22333,USHA," Don't go. India is a dreadful, dreadful place.",164
22334,ZUBIN," You know, it's the only country that still has the plague?  I mean, the plague! Please!",164
22335,USHA," Here's the registry. Send her a gift, and be glad you did not have to go.",164
22336,ELAINE,  Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.,164
22337,ZUBIN," If I had to go to India, I wouldn't go to the bathroom the entire trip.",164
22338,ELAINE,  That's fantastic.,164
22339,ZUBIN," And I'm not so crazy about Manhattan, either.",164
22340,NINA," Oh, you were going to tell me all about George.",164
22341,JERRY," Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.",164
22342,NINA, Really?,164
22343,JERRY," Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.",164
22344,NINA," I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation.",164
22345,JERRY, I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..,164
22346,NINA, Heh.. yeah.,164
22347,JERRY, Probably the reason..,164
22348,FDR, Are - are you dense? I said I wanted you to drop dead. Now.. drop dead! ,164
22349,KRAMER,  I knew it.. Stupid Jerry..,164
22350,JERRY," Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.",164
22351,KRAMER, But you haven't seen..,164
22352,JERRY, Just go back and ask him again. ,164
22353,KRAMER, Yeah.. ,164
22354,FDR, That's right. My birthday wish was that you drop dead.,164
22355,KRAMER," Well, why?",164
22356,FDR,  I have my reasons.,164
22357,KRAMER," Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.",164
22358,FDR, That's just a silly superstition. ,164
22359,KRAMER," Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.",164
22360,GEORGE, FDR?,164
22361,KRAMER,"  Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski.  I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look..",164
22362,GEORGE,  Stink eye?,164
22363,JERRY,  Crook eye?,164
22364,KRAMER," EVIL, eye.",164
22365,JERRY," Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.",164
22366,GEORGE," Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', ""These are my friends?!""",164
22367,JERRY, Everyday is my birthday. ,164
22368,KRAMER," Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.",164
22369,ELAINE, Hi.,164
22370,ELAINE, You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.,164
22371,JERRY,"  Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.",164
22372,ELAINE, Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this  today.,164
22373,JERRY, So you think it's a non-vite?,164
22374,ELAINE," It's an un-vitation!  Hey, are you gettin' taller?",164
22375,GEORGE, Timberlands. ,164
22376,ELAINE," Ah.  Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..",164
22377,JERRY," Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.",164
22378,GEORGE," Jerry, would you make the call already?",164
22379,ELAINE, What call?,164
22380,JERRY," He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.",164
22381,ELAINE,"  Oh, the great conversation girl.  The one you think can replace me?",164
22382,JERRY, I was kidding when I said that!,164
22383,GEORGE,  Told me the same thing.,164
22384,JERRY,"  Nina, Hi. It's Jerry.",164
22385,GEORGE, You-you sure you never slept with her?  Perfect.,164
22386,JERRY,"  Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?",164
22387,GEORGE,  Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..,164
22388,GEORGE, I'll have the Clams Casino.,164
22389,JERRY, Get outta here.,164
22390,GEORGE,"  ""Chef recommends""",164
22391,JERRY, Hmm..,164
22392,GEORGE,  I think she likes me.,164
22393,JERRY, Sure.,164
22394,GEORGE," So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina?  Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?",164
22395,JERRY, Are you?,164
22396,GEORGE," Well, what's the reason?",164
22397,JERRY, We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.,164
22398,GEORGE, How engrossing?,164
22399,JERRY," If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.",164
22400,GEORGE," Wow! Heh.  You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya? heh he he he he he...",164
22401,JERRY," Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.",164
22402,GEORGE," I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.",164
22403,JERRY, Why?,164
22404,GEORGE," In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!",164
22405,JERRY," So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?",164
22406,GEORGE, In every situation. No matter how silly I look.  Hm.. tastes a little funky.,164
22407,JERRY," Oh, I'm sure it's fine.",164
22408,ALL, ..to you!,164
22409,MAN," Come on, make a wish! Make a wish!",164
22410,KRAMER, Yeah!,164
22411,ALL," Heyyy, yeahhhh .",164
22412,GEORGE," Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.",164
22413,JERRY," Almost.  Hey, new Timberlands?",164
22414,GEORGE," Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!",164
22415,JERRY, Really?,164
22416,GEORGE, Five' eight. Five' seven.,164
22417,NINA, Jerry?,164
22418,JERRY, Nina?,164
22419,NINA, Hi.,164
22420,JERRY, It's been years!,164
22421,NINA, Yeah!,164
22422,JERRY,"  George, this is Nina.",164
22423,GEORGE, Nice to meet you.,164
22424,NINA," Nice to meet you, too.",164
22425,ELAINE,"  India? Tst, Yeah, right.  I'm goin' to India..",164
22426,NINA, And they call it the World Wide Web. You can e-mail anyone!,164
22427,JERRY,"  What are you, a scientist?!",164
22428,NINA," Ah, I gotta go. ",164
22429,JERRY, Ah.,164
22430,NINA, It's great talkin',164
22431,JERRY, Great talkin' to you.  What the hell is e-mail?,164
22432,GEORGE, How as the date?,164
22433,JERRY, Pretty good. I think she might be the one.,164
22434,SUSAN, No.,164
22435,GEORGE, Whooo..  Ooh.. French fries.,164
22436,SUSAN," Ah, George.",164
22437,GEORGE,"  Baked, uh, potato.",164
22438,SUSAN, Uh-huh.,164
22439,GEORGE, Sorry.,164
22440,SUSAN," Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister.",164
22441,KRAMER," Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! ",164
22442,JERRY, What are you bringing snowballs in here for?,164
22443,KRAMER," Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look,  there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great! ",164
22444,JERRY," Hi, Elaine.",164
22445,GEORGE, Hey!,164
22446,ELAINE,"  Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?",164
22447,KRAMER," Oh, hey, how you doing?",164
22448,JERRY," Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.",164
22449,KRAMER," Uh, no. Actually, it's Kramer.",164
22450,JERRY, Oh.,164
22451,KRAMER," Uh, you need any help, or..?",164
22452,JERRY," No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?",164
22453,KRAMER," Ah, no, no, no. I-I couldn't impose.",164
22454,JERRY, Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. ,164
22455,KRAMER,  Ohh  Really?,164
22456,JERRY,"  Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.",165
22457,MELISSA,"  Oh, fantastic! I'm starving.",165
22458,JERRY,  How about that.,165
22459,MELISSA,  Mmm-hmm.,165
22460,GEORGE, She ate breakfast naked?,165
22461,JERRY, She didn't even want a napkin.,165
22462,GEORGE," I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked.",165
22463,JERRY," Oh, it's a scene.",165
22464,GEORGE," It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?",165
22465,JERRY, I don't really have enough room.,165
22466,GEORGE,"  Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.",165
22467,ELAINE, Hey!,165
22468,PUDDY, Hi.,165
22469,JERRY, Hey.,165
22470,PUDDY,  I got to make a pit stop.,165
22471,ELAINE,  'Kay.,165
22472,JERRY, Back together?,165
22473,ELAINE," His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.",165
22474,JERRY, Ah...,165
22475,ELAINE, So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.,165
22476,GEORGE, 'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?,165
22477,ELAINE, He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.,165
22478,JERRY, Why now?,165
22479,ELAINE, A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.,165
22480,GEORGE, Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.,165
22481,JERRY, Still with the neck hole?,165
22482,GEORGE, Still upset. Very upset.,165
22483,ELAINE, What neck hole?,165
22484,GEORGE," Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.",165
22485,GEORGE, I asked if I could borrow a sweater.,165
22486,JERRY, A cashmere sweater.,165
22487,GEORGE," I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'",165
22488,ELAINE, Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!,165
22489,GEORGE," Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!",165
22490,ELAINE," Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?",165
22491,JERRY," No, I think the head does most of the stretching.",165
22492,GEORGE," Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.",165
22493,ELAINE, I really think it's the size of your neck.,165
22494,GEORGE, It's my head!,165
22495,ELAINE, Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!,165
22496,ELAINE, Hey.,165
22497,PEGGY, Hey.,165
22498,ELAINE," Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.",165
22499,PEGGY,  Yeah. Great.,165
22500,KRAMER," You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.",165
22501,JERRY, That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?,165
22502,KRAMER, Showering. How long does it take you?,165
22503,JERRY, Ten minutes.,165
22504,KRAMER,"  Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?",165
22505,ELAINE, Ten minutes.,165
22506,KRAMER, Let me smell you.,165
22507,ELAINE, All right. Whiff away.,165
22508,KRAMER,  Uh... that's not bad at all.,165
22509,ELAINE,  Hup! That's it.,165
22510,KRAMER,  OK.,165
22511,ELAINE," So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.",165
22512,JERRY, So?,165
22513,ELAINE," So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?",165
22514,JERRY,"  I think the damage is probably already done.  All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.",165
22515,ELAINE,"  Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.",165
22516,JERRY, Mmm.,165
22517,KRAMER," Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!",165
22518,JERRY,  Zephyr? That is not a word.,165
22519,MELISSA, Do you challenge?,165
22520,JERRY," No, I do not challenge.",165
22521,MELISSA, 66 points. Ha ha.,165
22522,JERRY," I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.",165
22523,MELISSA, You want some more ice tea?,165
22524,JERRY, Sure.,165
22525,MELISSA,  Wrong pipe.,165
22526,GEORGE, So she coughed.,165
22527,JERRY," Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man.",165
22528,GEORGE, Everything goes with naked.,165
22529,JERRY," When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.",165
22530,GEORGE," Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?",165
22531,JERRY," But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.",165
22532,GEORGE, All right. It's grovel time.,165
22533,HANKE," Hey, George. Jerry. Listen, I just got sober, so I've been going through the Twelve Steps.",165
22534,GEORGE," What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?",165
22535,HANKE, Yeah. Making amends.,165
22536,GEORGE, Important step. Maybe the most important.,165
22537,HANKE," Anyway, uh, Jerry, you know, this may sound dumb, but, you know, when we first met I thought your name was Gary. And, I think I may even have called you Gary a couple of times, and... I don't know if you noticed, but I always felt bad about it, so, I'm sorry.",165
22538,JERRY," Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.",165
22539,HANKE,"  Great. Great. Well, I'll see you guys later.",165
22540,KRAMER,"  Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.",165
22541,JERRY,  You got some suds over here.,165
22542,KRAMER,"  Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong.",165
22543,JERRY," Oh, come on!",165
22544,KRAMER," No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!",165
22545,JERRY, You promise you'll never come in here again?,165
22546,KRAMER,"  Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.",165
22547,JERRY,"  Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.",165
22548,KRAMER," Well, that's how cats do it.",165
22549,JERRY," But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.",165
22550,KRAMER, OK. Let's turn the water on now.,165
22551,JERRY," No, I told you, it's just a dry run.",165
22552,GEORGE,"  Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.",165
22553,JERRY, That's Step Ten?,165
22554,GEORGE," All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?",165
22555,KRAMER," Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?",165
22556,JERRY," You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer.",165
22557,KRAMER," Well, this has all been one big tease!",165
22558,ELAINE,  These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.,165
22559,PEGGY,  I'm... gonna get another bottle of water.,165
22560,WALTER,"  Here, take mine. There's a little left.",165
22561,PEGGY,"  Oh, thanks, Walter. Ahh!",165
22562,HANKE,"  Guys, there's no doubt that the pay is good. But I don't just know if I see myself working with ice cream.",165
22563,HANKE, I don't know if I'm into that.,165
22564,GEORGE,"  Oh, hello, Hanke, others.",165
22565,HANKE, George.,165
22566,GEORGE," You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.",165
22567,HANKE, Apology? For what?,165
22568,GEORGE, A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?,165
22569,HANKE," George, come on, not that neck hole thing.",165
22570,GEORGE," Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.",165
22571,HANKE," No way, you would've completely stretched it out.",165
22572,GEORGE, You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.,165
22573,HANKE," All right, George, all right. I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry. I'm so sorry that I didn't want your rather bulbous head struggling to find its way through the normal-size neck hole of my finely knit sweater.",165
22574,KRAMER,"  Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.",165
22575,MAN IN SHOWER,  Hey!,165
22576,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!",165
22577,KRAMER,  You got a steak?,165
22578,JERRY, What happened to you?,165
22579,KRAMER," Ah, people in this city are crazy.",165
22580,JERRY,  Here ya go.,165
22581,KRAMER,"  Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.",165
22582,JERRY, What?,165
22583,KRAMER," Yeah, a different one.",165
22584,JERRY,  Oh!,165
22585,KRAMER, Jerry!,165
22586,MELISSA,"  OK, Jerry. I fixed that bike.",165
22587,JERRY, Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.,165
22588,MELISSA,  I should really clean those bearings. Hold this. Look at all that gunk.,165
22589,JERRY, Please don't crouch.,165
22590,MELISSA, Ouch! Caught my skin.,165
22591,JERRY," Oh, that's bad. Especially that area.",165
22592,MELISSA, You got anything to snack on?,165
22593,JERRY, Uhh...,165
22594,MELISSA,"  Oh, pickles! Unnhhhh! It's a tough one.",165
22595,JERRY," Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!",165
22596,MELISSA,  Unnnnh! Oooh. That's gonna leave a welt. Look at that.,165
22597,JERRY,  I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.,165
22598,ELAINE," Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?",165
22599,PEGGY, You seem to be with a lot of men.,165
22600,ELAINE," What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?",165
22601,PEGGY, It's not. Good day.,165
22602,ELAINE,"  Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.",165
22603,JERRY," Well, technically he did apologize.",165
22604,GEORGE," Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!",165
22605,JERRY," So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?",165
22606,GEORGE, That's right. I'm two in the hole!,165
22607,JERRY," Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.",165
22608,GEORGE, Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?,165
22609,JERRY, Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?,165
22610,GEORGE," Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?",165

22613,JERRY,  Hello?,165
22614,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!",165
22615,JERRY, World War I plane?,165
22616,KRAMER," No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.",165
22617,JERRY, When are ya gettin' out?,165
22618,KRAMER," I'm not! I'll see ya later, buddy.",165
22619,PETERMAN," Bad news, people. Peggy is home sick.",165
22620,ELAINE," Oh, please.",165
22621,PETERMAN," She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise.",165
22622,ELAINE," Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?",165
22623,PETERMAN," I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed.",165
22624,ELAINE," Yeah, let me tell you something",165
22625,GEORGE, So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?,165
22626,SPONSOR, Sponsor.,165
22627,GEORGE," Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.",165
22628,SPONSOR, He's doing very well. He's already on to Step Ten.,165
22629,GEORGE," Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.",165
22630,SPONSOR, Is there some unresolved issue between you and Jason?,165
22631,GEORGE," I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.",165
22632,SPONSOR, I'm not sure what you want me to do.,165
22633,GEORGE," Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.",165
22634,SPONSOR," You're quite upset, George.",165
22635,GEORGE," Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.",165
22636,SPONSOR, Admit there's a higher power?,165
22637,GEORGE," Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.",165
22638,GEORGE," All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much.  By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...",165
22639,KRAMER,"  Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back.",165
22640,MELISSA,  What are you doing?,165
22641,JERRY,"  I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.",165
22642,MELISSA," No, not that. Why are you naked?",165
22643,JERRY, I thought naked is good.,165
22644,MELISSA,  This isn't good naked.,165
22645,SPONSER," George, here, have a seat.",165
22646,GEORGE,  Where's Hanke?,165
22647,SPONSER,  Shhhhh.,165
22648,LEADER," OK, let's get started. Welcome to Rage-aholics Anonymous.",165
22649,GEORGE, What? Rate-aholics?,165
22650,SPONSER," George, this can help you.",165
22651,GEORGE," Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.",165
22652,LEADER, Excuse me. We have a 'no yelling' policy at these meetings.,165
22653,GEORGE," Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!",165
22654,LEADER, Please don't call me 'Pinhead'.,165
22655,GEORGE, I'm losin' it!,165
22656,JERRY, He took you to Rage-aholics? Why?,165
22657,GEORGE, Probably because this whole Universe is against me!,165
22658,JERRY, You've got a little rage.,165
22659,GEORGE, I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!,165
22660,JERRY," By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.",165
22661,GEORGE, This bread has nuts in it!,165
22662,JERRY,"  Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?",165
22663,ELAINE, Chicken wing shoulder blades.,165
22664,JERRY, That's it?,165
22665,ELAINE," No, but that's one problem. Why?",165
22666,JERRY," Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--",165
22667,ELAINE, Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.,165
22668,GEORGE, Why not? It's a good look for a woman.,165
22669,ELAINE," Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.",165
22670,JERRY, So you don't think it's attractive?,165
22671,ELAINE," It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.",165
22672,GEORGE," Well, some women like it.",165
22673,ELAINE, Hmm. Sickies.,165
22674,KRAMER,"  Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.",165
22675,PUDDY,  Puddy.,165
22676,KRAMER," Is, uh, David Puddy there?",165
22677,PUDDY, This is Puddy.,165
22678,KRAMER," Well, this is Kramer.",165
22679,PUDDY, I know.,165
22680,KRAMER," Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?",165
22681,PUDDY," Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.",165
22682,KRAMER, No. It says 'main line'.,165
22683,PUDDY," It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?",165
22684,KRAMER, Yeah.,165
22685,PUDDY,"  Hey, man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you through it.",165
22686,KRAMER," Oh, OK. Well, thanks, buddy.",165
22687,ELAINE," Hey, Puddy.",165
22688,PUDDY," Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him.",165
22689,ELAINE, Balloon bouquet? For who?,165
22690,PUDDY, Peggy took a turn for the worst.,165
22691,ELAINE," Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?",165
22692,PUDDY, That's what he said.,165
22693,ELAINE, I don't believe this woman.,165
22694,PUDDY," Talk to me, Babe.",165
22695,ELAINE, She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.,165
22696,PUDDY," Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about.",165
22697,ELAINE, Huh?,165
22698,PUDDY,  I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years.,165
22699,ELAINE, What is this symbol?,165
22700,PUDDY, It's a germ.,165
22701,PEGGY," Elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you're currently sleeping with over to talk to me, but I assure you, I don't have any problem with germs.",165
22702,PUDDY, Don't you? Elaine.,165
22703,PEGGY,  Please!,165
22704,PUDDY, I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.,165
22705,PEGGY, Really?,165
22706,PUDDY, I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in.,165
22707,ELAINE," Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.",165
22708,PUDDY, They're bacteria traps.,165
22709,PEGGY, So you... just learned to live with it?,165
22710,PUDDY, For the most part.,165
22711,ELAINE," OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.",165
22712,JERRY, So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?,165
22713,MELISSA, This is nice.,165
22714,JERRY," Yes, clothes. This is normal.",165
22715,MELISSA," Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? I was thinking that we could go down...",165
22716,MELISSA," Jerry? Jerry, are you listening to me?",165
22717,JERRY, Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.,165
22718,MELISSA, I wanted to know what you're doing tomorrow.,165
22719,JERRY," Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...",165
22720,KRAMER,  So you broke up?,165
22721,JERRY," We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.",165
22722,KRAMER, Hang on.,165
22723,JERRY, So what are you up to?,165
22724,KRAMER," Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?",165
22725,JERRY," Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.",165
22726,KRAMER, No problem there.,165
22727,HANKE," George. Thanks for coming down to talk to me. I wanted to see you right away, but my hours here aren't very flexible. I just started yesterday.",165
22728,GEORGE," Well, I'm here. What is it?",165
22729,HANKE," Well, I talked to my sponsor, and, uh, I've thought it over, and, you know, my apology at the coffee shop was sarcastic, and rude, and you deserve much better.",165
22730,GEORGE,"  Well, thank you.",165
22731,HANKE, You're welcome.,165
22732,KID,  Can I get a Triple Minute Man Mint?,165
22733,HANKE, Waffle or sugar cone?,165
22734,GEORGE," Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.",165
22735,HANKE, What?,165
22736,KID, Can you get on that cone?,165
22737,HANKE," Would you hang on just a second, son? George, what are you talking about?",165
22738,GEORGE," Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.",165
22739,KID, Is there anybody else here but you?,165
22740,HANKE," I'm alone, and it's my second day. You know, I don't even think we have that flavor so... George, really, enough, ok? You know, I-I admitted I was wrong, so what more do you want from me?",165
22741,GEORGE, I would like an apology.,165
22742,HANKE," All right, look, you know--",165
22743,KID," No, this guy doesn't know what he's doing.",165
22744,HANKE," Oh, yes I do. Yes, I do. OK? I'm interacting with someone here, if you can understand that. Now, I'm sorry.",165
22745,GEORGE," Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.",165
22746,HANKE," I'm not saying anything to you. I'm not sorry. I was never sorry. It was cashmere. I hate Step Nine! Where's that Rum Raisin? Where is it? Can't find anything. I need a drink. Ah, daquiri ice. Here we go. What are you looking at? Get out! Come on, can't you see we're closed?! Get out!",165
22747,ELAINE,"  Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY",165
22748,KRAMER," Well, thank you.",165
22749,ELAINE," Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.",165
22750,KRAMER, Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.,165
22751,PEGGY, You have a garbage disposal in your bathtub?,165
22752,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.",165
22753,ELAINE, This food was in the shower with you?,165
22754,KRAMER, Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed.,165
22755,PUDDY," Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!",165
22756,GEORGE," Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?",165
22757,PUDDY,"  No, germ-o-phobes.",165
22758,GEORGE, Thanks. What are you guys doin' here?,165
22759,ELAINE, Kramer.,165
22760,GEORGE, Right.,165
22761,HANKE,"  Hi, I'm, uh, Jason. I'm a rage-aholic.",165
22762,AUDIENCE," Hi, Jason.",165
22763,HANKE," Uh, this is my first meeting.",165
22764,GEORGE, Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!,165
22765,HANKE, Please. Step Nine.,165
22766,GEORGE, That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.,165
22767,GEORGE, It wasn't funny.,165
22768,HANKE," It was a very nice sweater. Take a look at his neck, not to mention the melon sitting on top of it. I don't know if I'd trust him with a v-neck.",165
22769,GEORGE," He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!",165
22770,ELAINE," So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?",166
22771,JERRY," Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.",166

22778,TIM,"  Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate..  Happy Chanukah, Tiffany! ",166
22779,ELAINE, This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.,166
22780,GEORGE, I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. ,166
22781,ELAINE, Oh..  I got denim vest checking me out.  Fake phone number's coming out tonight.,166
22782,JERRY, You have a standard fake?,166
22783,ELAINE, Mm-hmm.,166
22784,JERRY,  That's neat.,166

22794,GEORGE, Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.,166

22796,GEORGE," Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing",166
22797,JERRY,  You're gonna open your mail here?,166
22798,GEORGE," Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this.  ""Have you seen me?""  Nope.  Woah, something from Whatley.",166
22799,JERRY," See? You give, and you get.",166
22800,GEORGE,"  ""This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance.""?",166
22801,JERRY," Oh, that's nice.",166
22802,GEORGE," I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying ""I've given your gift to someone else!""",166
22803,JERRY, To a children's charity!,166
22804,GEORGE, Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!,166
22805,ELAINE, Hey!,166
22806,JERRY, Hey.,166
22807,ELAINE,"  Oh, nothing for me.  I'm going to ""Atomic Sub"" later.",166
22808,JERRY," ""Atomic Sub""? Why are you eating there?",166
22809,ELAINE," I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine  captain.",166
22810,JERRY, What does that mean?,166
22811,ELAINE,  Free sub.,166
22812,ELAINE, What?,166
22813,GEORGE, Nothing. It's a card from my dad.,166
22814,ELAINE," What is it?  ""Dear son, Happy Festivus."" What is Festivus?",166
22815,GEORGE," It's nothing, stop it..",166
22816,JERRY, When George was growing up..,166
22817,GEORGE,"  Jerry, No!",166
22818,JERRY, His father..,166
22819,GEORGE, No!,166
22820,JERRY," Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.",166
22821,ELAINE, Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.,166
22822,GEORGE,  Alright..,166
22823,JERRY," And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?",166
22824,GEORGE, Jerry! Stop it!,166
22825,JERRY, And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?,166
22826,GEORGE, I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! ,166
22827,ELAINE," Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my ""Atomic Sub"" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!",166
22828,JERRY, So?,166
22829,ELAINE," I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!",166
22830,JERRY," No, you walk out.",166
22831,ELAINE," Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.",166
22832,JERRY," No, you wait for the movie!",166
22833,ELAINE,  I want that free sub.,166
22834,JERRY," You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized!  They're cloning sheep now.",166
22835,KRAMER,"  No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!",166
22836,JERRY," So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?",166
22837,ELAINE, That's a good idea.,166
22838,KRAMER,"  Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye.  Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.",166
22839,JERRY, What strike?,166

22845,ELAINE," Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.",166
22846,KRAMER," Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.",166
22847,ELAINE, What were your.. demands?,166
22848,KRAMER," Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.",166
22849,ELAINE, I believe that's the new minimum wage.,166
22850,KRAMER," Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. ",166
22851,JERRY, Why didn't you ever mention this?,166
22852,KRAMER," Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing!  ",166
22853,KRAMER," All right, everybody! I'm back!",166

22858,MANAGER," NO, I""m sure they all got jobs.. like, ten years ago.",166
22859,KRAMER," Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..",166
22860,MANAGER, I could use someone for the holidays..,166
22861,KRAMER," Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel!  What are those?",166
22862,MANAGER, Those are rasin bagels.,166
22863,KRAMER,  I never thought I'd live to see that..,166
22864,ELAINE," So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.",166
22865,BOOKIE, So. You're Elaine Benes. We've been getting calls fro you for 5 years.,166
22866,ELAINE," So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..",166
22867,BOOKIE,"  Hey, Charlie! Guess who's here. Elaine Benes.",166
22868,CHARLIE, Elaine Benes?!,166
22869,BOOKIE," You make a lot of man friends. You know who's a man? Charlie here, he's a man. You know who else? Me. I'm a man.",166
22870,CHARLIE,  I'm a man.,166

22883,GWEN," Yeah! Come on, our table is ready.",166
22884,GEORGE," So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?",166
22885,JERRY, Have you come across this?,166
22886,GEORGE," Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.",166
22887,JERRY,  Like the Batman villain?,166
22888,GEORGE,  If that helps you..,166
22889,JERRY," So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up",166
22890,GEORGE,  Clint Eastwood!,166
22891,JERRY, Yeah.,166
22892,GEORGE," Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. ",166
22893,JERRY,"  ""A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund."" - What is that?",166
22894,GEORGE,  Made it up.,166
22895,JERRY,"  ""The Human Fund. Money for people.""",166
22896,GEORGE, What do you think?,166
22897,JERRY, It has a certain understated stupidity.,166
22898,GEORGE,  The Outlaw of Josey Whales!,166
22899,JERRY, ..Yeah.,166
22900,KRAMER," Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!",166
22901,JERRY, How was your first day?,166
22902,KRAMER," Oh, fantastic!  It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.",166
22903,JERRY, Your hands were in the dough?,166
22904,KRAMER," No, I didn't make these bagels.  Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them.  Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.",166
22905,GEORGE," Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. ",166
22906,JERRY, Happy Festivus!,166
22907,KRAMER, What's Festivus?,166
22908,JERRY, When George was growing up..,166
22909,GEORGE,  No!,166
22910,JERRY, His father..,166
22911,GEORGE, Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!,166
22912,ELAINE," Happy Festivus, Georgie.",166
22913,KRAMER, Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!,166
22914,ELAINE," Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.",166
22915,JERRY, You're still trying to gget that free sub?,166
22916,ELAINE," Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.",166
22917,JERRY, Is there a captain's hat involved in this?,166
22918,ELAINE, Maybe.,166
22919,FRANK," Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?",166
22920,KRAMER," Well, just tell me everything, huh?",166
22921,FRANK," Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!",166
22922,KRAMER, What happened to the doll?,166
22923,FRANK," It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. ""A Festivus for the rest of us!""",166
22924,KRAMER, That musta been some kind of doll.,166
22925,FRANK, She was.,166
22926,GEORGE," Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas!  Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. ",166
22927,SANDY,  ..Oh.. thanks. ,166
22928,GEORGE," Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! ",166
22929,PHIL, Ow!,166
22930,GEORGE," Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! ",166
22931,KRUGER, Not if you could see our books.. what's this?,166
22932,GEORGE, The Human Fund.,166
22933,KRUGER, Whatever. ,166
22934,GEORGE, Exactly.  Erica!,166
22935,FRANK," And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.",166
22936,KRAMER, Is there a tree?,166
22937,FRANK," No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.",166
22938,KRAMER," Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.",166
22939,FRANK, Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space. ,166
22940,ELAINE," Hello, Frank.",166
22941,FRANK," Hello, woman. ",166
22942,ELAINE, Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest?,166
22943,KRAMER," No.  Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.",166
22944,MANAGER, Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. This is the holidays.,166
22945,KRAMER, But it's Festivus.,166
22946,MANAGER, What?,166
22947,KRAMER, You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..,166
22948,MANAGER, That's not a right.,166
22949,KRAMER," Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine.  It's a walk out!",166
22950,ELAINE," No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.",166
22951,KRAMER, What? You're siding with management?!,166
22952,ELAINE," No, I just..",166
22953,KRAMER,  Scab! Scab!  Scab!,166
22954,GWEN, Hey.,166
22955,JERRY," Boy, am I glad to see you.",166
22956,GWEN, You were expecting someone else?,166
22957,JERRY, You never know.,166
22958,GWEN,"  You know, you might want to take the tunnel.",166
22959,JERRY," So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?",166
22960,GWEN, I can go either way.,166
22961,JERRY,  You're telling me.,166
22962,GEORGE," So, she was switching? Back and forth?",166
22963,JERRY," Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.",166
22964,GEORGE," So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.",166
22965,JERRY," I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?",166
22966,GEORGE, Lights out.,166
22967,JERRY," Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.",166
22968,GEORGE,"  Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!",166
22969,JERRY," That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.",166
22970,GEORGE, I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.,166
22971,JERRY," Oh, that's classy.",166
22972,KRAMER," Well, Happy Festivus.",166
22973,GEORGE, What is that? Is taht the pole?!,166
22974,FRANK," George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.",166
22975,GEORGE,  That's why I hate it.,166
22976,KRAMER, There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.,166
22977,FRANK," George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. ",166
22978,FRANK, Read that poem.,166
22979,GEORGE,  I can't read it. I need my glasses!,166
22980,FRANK," You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!",166
22981,ESTELLE, Leave him alone!,166
22982,FRANK," Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.",166
22983,GEORGE, No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength!  I hate Festivus!,166
22984,FRANK, We had some good times.,166
22985,GWEN, Hey.,166
22986,JERRY," I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.",166
22987,GWEN, Hi.,166
22988,KRAMER,  Hello.,166
22989,GWEN," So, you ready to go?",166
22990,JERRY," Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up.  Now this is a good looking booth.",166
22991,KRAMER," Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, ",166
22992,MANAGER,"  Lady, if you want a sandwich, I'll make you a sandwich.",166
22993,ELAINE,"  I want the one that I earned.  I'll get it. I'll get it!  H&H, and Elaine.",166
22994,KRAMER,"  Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.",166
22995,ELAINE, What did you do?,166
22996,KRAMER, You've been warned.,166
22997,ELAINE," Oh, hi! ",166
22998,WORKER," Hey, the steam valve's broke.",166
22999,MANAGER, Can we still make bagels?,166
23000,WORKER, Sure. It's just a little steamy.,166
23001,KRAMER, Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!,166
23002,KRUGER," George, I got something for you.  I'm suppose to find a charity and throw some of the company's money at it. They all seem the same to me, so, what's the difference? ",166
23003,GEORGE, 20 thousand dollars?,166
23004,KRUGER," Made out to the Human Fund.  Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home.",166
23005,GWEN," Jerry, how many times do we have to come to this.. place?",166
23006,JERRY, Why? It's our place.,166
23007,GWEN, I just found a rubber band in my soup.,166
23008,JERRY, Oh.. I know who's cooking today!,166
23009,GEORGE," Hey! Surprise, surprise!",166
23010,JERRY," Hey, Georgie!",166
23011,GWEN, I think I'm just gonna go.,166
23012,JERRY, I'll be here.,166
23013,GEORGE,"  Hey, soup.",166
23014,JERRY, She didn't touch it.,166
23015,GEORGE," Ohh.. Paco!  Hey, take a look at this. ",166
23016,JERRY, 20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.,166
23017,GEORGE, I don't know.,166
23018,JERRY, Excuse me?,166
23019,GEORGE, I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.,166
23020,JERRY, You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.,166
23021,GEORGE, I'm serious.,166
23022,JERRY, You're going to start your own charity?,166
23023,GEORGE," I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time!  .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..",166
23024,ELAINE," Kramer, the vest just called.",166
23025,KRAMER,  Yama - Hama! It's fright night!,166
23026,ELAINE," Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that ""Atomic Sub"" card.",166
23027,KRAMER, And?,166
23028,ELAINE,  Free sub.  I'll see ya.,166
23029,KRAMER, Yeah.,166
23030,GWEN," Kramer, Hi!",166
23031,KRAMER," Oh, hello.",166
23032,GWEN, It's Gwen.. We met .. at the coffee shop.,166
23033,KRAMER, Ah-huh.,166
23034,GWEN," I'm dating your friend, Jerry..",166
23035,KRAMER," Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.",166
23036,GWEN, That's why we're always hiding in that coffee shop! He's afraid of getting caught.,166
23037,KRAMER," Oh, he's a tomcat.",166
23038,ELAINE, Steve.,166
23039,DENIM VEST, Hmm?,166
23040,ELAINE, It's Elaine.,166
23041,DENIM VEST, From Tim Whatley's party?,166
23042,ELAINE, Yeah.,166
23043,DENIM VEST, You look.. different.,166
23044,ELAINE, I see you're still sticking with the denim.  Do you have that card that I gave you?,166
23045,DENIM VEST," Well, I had it back at my place, but I can't go there now.. I'll give it to you later, or something.",166
23046,ELAINE," No, no, no. You give me your number.",166
23047,DENIM VEST, Okay. Sure.  Do you have the mumps?,166
23048,ELAINE, No.,166
23049,DENIM VEST, Typhoid?,166
23050,ELAINE, No.,166
23051,DENIM VEST,  Yama - Hama!,166
23052,ELAINE, A fake number! Blimey!,166
23053,KRUGER," George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.",166
23054,GEORGE," Well, there could be.",166
23055,KRUGER, But there isn't.,166
23056,GEORGE," Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. ",166
23057,KRUGER," George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift.",166
23058,GEORGE," Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.",166
23059,KRUGER, Vemonous?,166
23060,GEORGE," Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!",166
23061,KRUGER," Are you making all this up, too?",166
23062,GEORGE," Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.",166
23063,KRUGER," Yeah, you probably should.",166
23064,GEORGE, Happy Festivus!,166
23065,FRANK, George? This is a surprise.  Who's the suit?,166
23066,GEORGE," Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.",166
23067,FRANK," Have you seen the pole, Kruger?",166
23068,GEORGE," Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.",166
23069,FRANK, He's gonna see it.,166
23070,GEORGE, Happy Festivus!  Yama - Hama!,166
23071,ELAINE, I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?,166
23072,GEORGE, Embracing my roots.,166
23073,JERRY, They nailed you on the 20 G's?,166
23074,GEORGE, Busted cold.,166
23075,FRANK, It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.,166
23076,KRUGER, I find your belief system fascinating.,166
23077,KRAMER," Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone!  Hee, hee, hee!",166
23078,BOOKIE," Hello again, Miss Benes.",166
23079,ELAINE, What are you doing here?,166
23080,BOOKIE," Damnedest thing.. me and Charlie were calling to ask you out, and, uh, we got this bagel place..",166
23081,KRAMER,  I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!,166
23082,ESTELLE, Dinner's ready!,166
23083,FRANK, Let's begin.,166
23084,KRAMER, Uh.. that's right.,166
23085,FRANK," Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!",166
23086,GEORGE," Oh, God.",166
23087,FRANK,"  Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.",166
23088,GWEN, Jerry!,166
23089,JERRY, Gwen! How'd you know I was here?,166
23090,GWEN, Kramer told me.,166
23091,KRAMER, Another Festivus miracle!,166
23092,GWEN, I guess this is the ugly girl I've been hearing about.,166
23093,ELAINE," Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.",166
23094,JERRY," Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah!  Bad lighting on the porch.",166
23095,ELAINE,"  Hey, how'd my horse do?",166
23096,BOOKIE, He had to be shot.,166
23097,FRANK," And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.",166
23098,GEORGE, Not the feats of strength..,166
23099,FRANK," This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.",166
23100,KRAMER," Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.",166
23101,JERRY, I thought you were on strike?,166
23102,KRAMER," Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little  out there.",166
23103,GEORGE, Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?,166
23104,KRUGER,  How about George?,166
23105,FRANK," Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!",166
23106,GEORGE," Oh, please, somebody, stop this!",166
23107,FRANK,  Let's rumble!,166
23108,ESTELLE," I think you can take him, Georgie!",166
23109,GEORGE," Oh, come on! Be sensible.",166
23110,FRANK," Stop crying, and fight your father!",166
23111,GEORGE," Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!",166
23112,FRANK, This is the best Festivus ever!,166
23113,MANAGER, Alright. That's enough. You're fired.,166
23114,KRAMER, Thank - you! ,166
23115,WAITRESS," Careful, this plate is extremely hot.",168
23116,ELAINE, Thank you. Ow!,168
23117,WAITRESS, I just told you it was hot. Why'd you touch it?,168
23118,ELAINE, I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.,168
23119,PUDDY," Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?",168
23120,ELAINE," I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?",168
23121,PUDDY, It's my winter coat.,168
23122,ELAINE, A fur?,168
23123,PUDDY, Is there a problem?,168
23124,ELAINE, A seemingly infinite supply.,168
23125,ELAINE," Ow! Careful, it's hot.",168
23126,PUDDY, Ow!,168
23127,JERRY," So, Puddy wear's a man fur?",168
23128,ELAINE, He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.,168
23129,JERRY," And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.",168
23130,ELAINE," Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.",168
23131,GEORGE, And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?,168
23132,ELAINE, We never dated in winter.,168
23133,JERRY, You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.,168
23134,ELAINE," Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.",168
23135,GEORGE," An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.",168
23136,JERRY, Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.,168
23137,GEORGE," All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.",168
23138,JERRY, Cheapness is not a sense.,168
23139,ELAINE," I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...",168
23140,JERRY, I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.,168
23141,KRAMER, Hey.,168
23142,JERRY, Hey.,168
23143,KRAMER, You got any pliers?,168
23144,JERRY," What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?",168
23145,NEWMAN, Hilarious.,168
23146,KRAMER, Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.,168
23147,ELAINE, Why?,168
23148,NEWMAN, To prevent an ambush.,168
23149,KRAMER," Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.",168
23150,JERRY, But then anyone can just look in and see you.,168
23151,KRAMER," Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'",168
23152,ELAINE, I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.,168
23153,JERRY," Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.",168
23154,KRAMER, Mmm... Nice wallet.,168
23155,NEWMAN, Wallet.,168
23156,JERRY, What?,168
23157,KRAMER," Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.",168
23158,JERRY, That's a five.,168
23159,KRAMER," I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio...",168
23160,SILVIO," Eh, what are you doing?",168
23161,KRAMER," Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.",168
23162,SILVIO," Hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. I'm the super. Who said you could do that?",168
23163,KRAMER," Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?",168
23164,SILVIO, Like what?,168
23165,KRAMER," Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.",168
23166,SILVIO," No, no, no, no. No, that's all right.",168
23167,KRAMER," Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--",168
23168,SILVIO," Newman? He did this, too?",168
23169,KRAMER," Well, yeah.",168
23170,SILVIO, I deal with him.,168
23171,GEORGE," Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.",168
23172,JERRY, Except the store's in Delaware.,168
23173,GEORGE, I'll have 'em overnight it.,168
23174,JERRY, Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.,168
23175,GEORGE, It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.,168
23176,JERRY, Why?,168
23177,GEORGE," Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.",168
23178,JERRY, But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.,168
23179,GEORGE, I need everything in there.,168
23180,JERRY, Irish money?,168
23181,GEORGE, I might go there.,168
23182,JERRY, Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.,168
23183,GEORGE," All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.",168
23184,KRAMER, Who is it?,168
23185,NEWMAN, It's Newman.,168
23186,KRAMER, What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.,168
23187,NEWMAN, I can't believe I'm being evicted.,168
23188,KRAMER, What? What are you talking about?,168
23189,NEWMAN, The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.,168
23190,KRAMER," No. No, he can't do that.",168
23191,NEWMAN," I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.",168
23192,KRAMER," Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.",168
23193,NEWMAN," Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.",168
23194,JERRY," George, I am loving this no wallet thing.",168
23195,GEORGE, A man carries a wallet.,168
23196,JERRY," You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.",168
23197,JOY MAYO," Hey, Jerry.",168
23198,JERRY," Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place.",168
23199,JOY MAYO," Thanks. George, can you do me a favor and stay by the phone in case anybody calls and needs directions?",168
23200,GEORGE, Love to.,168
23201,JOY MAYO, Thanks. Jerry...,168
23202,JERRY, Music?,168
23203,JOY MAYO," Actually, can you keep an eye on the aquarium and make sure nobody taps on the glass?",168
23204,JERRY, But I could do that and the music.,168
23205,JOY MAYO," Oh, no, don't worry about the music. Just... have fun!",168
23206,JERRY, I was ready to get jiggy with it.,168
23207,PUDDY, Hey.,168
23208,JERRY," Hey, Elaine.",168
23209,ELAINE, Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.,168
23210,JERRY," So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?",168
23211,ELAINE," So, George... did you get the chair?",168
23212,GEORGE," No, I don't have it yet.",168
23213,JERRY," So, we're givin' him nothing?",168
23214,GEORGE," No, I brought a picture of the chair.",168
23215,JERRY, Did you at least get him a card?,168
23216,GEORGE, I thought we'd all sign the picture.,168
23217,JOY MAYO, Elaine...,168
23218,ELAINE," Hey, Joe Mayo.",168
23219,JOY MAYO, I need you to be in charge of coats.,168
23220,ELAINE," Oh, fantastic.",168
23221,JOY MAYO," And Puddy, can you make sure no one puts a drink on my...sound system?",168
23222,PUDDY," Sure thing, Joe Mayo.",168
23223,JERRY," Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?",168
23224,KERI, Nice.,168
23225,JERRY,  It's working.  Don't tap on the glass.,168
23226,GEORGE,  Joe Mayo's apartment?,168
23227,PUDDY,  Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.,168
23228,ELAINE," Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.",168
23229,SILVIO, Why are we in Jerry's apartment?,168
23230,KRAMER," Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.",168
23231,SILVIO," Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I are about to go bowling.",168
23232,KRAMER," Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?",168
23233,SILVIO, I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator.,168
23234,KRAMER," Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.",168
23235,SILVIO," OK, on your word he can stay.",168
23236,KRAMER, All right.,168
23237,SILVIO, But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.,168
23238,KRAMER," Well, you won't regret it.",168
23239,SILVIO, What's wrong?,168
23240,JOY MAYO," Elaine, thanks for coming.",168
23241,ELAINE, Good working with you.,168
23242,PUDDY," All right, let's hit the bricks.",168
23243,ELAINE, What?,168
23244,JOY MAYO," Hey, I got a coat just like this!",168
23245,ELAINE, Oh. Uhhh...,168
23246,ELAINE, So Joe Mayo had the same coat.,168
23247,GEORGE, And you threw it out the window?,168
23248,ELAINE, Mm-hmm.,168
23249,GEORGE," God, you're like a rock star.",168
23250,ELAINE, So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.,168
23251,JERRY, Because you threw it out.,168
23252,ELAINE," No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.",168
23253,JERRY, But you did actually throw his coat out the window.,168
23254,ELAINE," But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.",168
23255,JERRY, But that's you.,168
23256,ELAINE," So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.",168
23257,GEORGE," Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.",168
23258,JERRY, Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.,168
23259,GEORGE," This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.",168
23260,ELAINE, Look at you. You're on a slant.,168
23261,GEORGE," Here, just give me a couple of napkins.",168
23262,GEORGE," There, there I'm fine.",168
23263,JERRY, What was that?,168
23264,GEORGE, I think I had some hard candy in there.,168
23265,GEORGE," No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.",168
23266,GEORGE, Ahhh. How does this thing work?,168
23267,GEORGE,Ahhhhh...,168
23268,DELIVERY MAN," Sir, do you want me to deliver this to your friend's place or not?",168
23269,GEORGE, Ahhhhh...,168
23270,KERI, Ready to go?,168
23271,JERRY, All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.,168
23272,KERI, You don't go that often?,168
23273,JERRY," No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?",168
23274,KERI, Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me?,168
23275,JERRY," Compact, lipstick, all this?",168
23276,KERI, And can you help to carry my keys?,168
23277,JERRY," What are you, a medieval dungeon master?",168
23278,KERI, And a tin of altoids.,168
23279,JERRY, Ow! Sharp key.,168
23280,KRAMER," So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?",168
23281,NEWMAN," Well, there's very little sleeping going on.",168
23282,KRAMER," Well, why didn't you tell me about this?",168
23283,NEWMAN," Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.",168
23284,KRAMER," Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.",168
23285,NEWMAN," Hey, what is that up that tree?",168
23286,KRAMER," Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.",168
23287,NEWMAN," No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.",168
23288,KRAMER," Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?",168
23289,NEWMAN, The Pacific Northwest.,168
23290,ELAINE," So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.",168
23291,JERRY," You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.",168
23292,ELAINE, You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.,168
23293,JERRY, Not more of that crap from the Titanic?,168
23294,ELAINE, No. No. It's a small men's carryall.,168
23295,JERRY, I'm not carrying a purse.,168
23296,ELAINE, It's not a purse. It's European.,168
23297,JERRY, Oh.,168
23298,ELAINE," Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?",168
23299,JERRY, I don't know.,168
23300,ELAINE," If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.",168
23301,GEORGE, Yeah?,168
23302,JERRY," Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?",168
23303,GEORGE, Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...,168
23304,JERRY, What?,168
23305,GEORGE, It's in... transit.,168
23306,ELAINE, Did he get it?,168
23307,JERRY, No.,168
23308,ELAINE," Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.",168
23309,GEORGE,"  What, she's out?",168
23310,JERRY," Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.",168
23311,GEORGE, Allllll right!,168
23312,JERRY, What is that noise?,168
23313,GEORGE,  That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!,168
23314,JERRY," You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.",168
23315,KRAMER," Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.",168
23316,ELAINE," Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.",168
23317,KRAMER," Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.",168
23318,ELAINE, What are you talking about?,168
23319,KRAMER," Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!",168
23320,ELAINE, 88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!,168
23321,JERRY, What was that pop sound?,168
23322,KRAMER," Well, I had some hard candy in there.",168
23323,NEWMAN," So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?",168
23324,ELAINE," Come in, come in.",168
23325,NEWMAN," Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.",168
23326,ELAINE," Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.",168
23327,NEWMAN, This isn't about my opening your mail?,168
23328,ELAINE, What?,168
23329,NEWMAN," Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.",168
23330,ELAINE," Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.",168
23331,NEWMAN," Sorry. Climbers, keepers.",168
23332,ELAINE," You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.",168
23333,NEWMAN, You are?,168
23334,ELAINE," Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.",168
23335,NEWMAN," Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.",168
23336,ELAINE, Ha ha ha ha.,168
23337,NEWMAN," Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?",168
23338,ELAINE," Uh, don't worry, he's cool.",168
23339,NEWMAN, Cool?,168
23340,ELAINE," Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?",168
23341,NEWMAN," Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.",168
23342,ELAINE," All right, we're done here.",168
23343,NEWMAN," For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--",168
23344,ELAINE," Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.",168
23345,KERI, Nice carryall.,168
23346,JERRY, It's European.,168
23347,KERI, Do you still have my lipstick?,168
23348,JERRY," Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?",168
23349,KERI, My job was to keep you away from the music.,168
23350,JERRY," What, he doesn't like my taste in music?",168
23351,KERI, Guess not.,168
23352,JERRY, You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!,168
23353,SILVIO," Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole.",168
23354,KRAMER," Hey, Silvio!",168
23355,SILVIO, Look at this.,168
23356,KRAMER, Huh?,168
23357,SILVIO," Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?",168
23358,KRAMER," Relax, Silvio.",168
23359,SILVIO," No, that's it. You're both out of the building!",168
23360,KRAMER," Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!",168
23361,SILVIO, A man's?,168
23362,KRAMER, Yeah.,168
23363,SILVIO, What kind of a man would wear fur?,168
23364,KRAMER," Oh, lots of 'em.",168
23365,SILVIO, Would you?,168
23366,KRAMER, No.,168
23367,SILVIO, Then who?,168
23368,KRAMER, What about Jerry?,168
23369,SILVIO, Jerry?,168
23370,KRAMER," Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.",168
23371,SILVIO," Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!",168
23372,KRAMER," Yeah, something like that.",168
23373,JERRY, I have to do what?,168
23374,KRAMER, All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.,168
23375,JERRY, I'm not wearing the fur.,168
23376,KRAMER," Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.",168
23377,JERRY, Is that right?,168
23378,KRAMER," All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?",168
23379,JERRY," Newman, too?",168
23380,KRAMER," Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.",168
23381,JERRY, That's my walkman!,168
23382,KRAMER, And you'll get it back.,168
23383,JERRY, All right.,168
23384,KRAMER," All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.",168
23385,GEORGE, Hey.,168
23386,KRAMER," Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.",168
23387,JERRY," George, did you get that chair yet?",168
23388,GEORGE, It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?,168
23389,JERRY, You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.,168
23390,GEORGE, Excuse me?,168
23391,JERRY, Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.,168
23392,GEORGE," Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?",168
23393,KRAMER," Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?",168
23394,GEORGE," He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.",168
23395,KRAMER," I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.",168
23396,GEORGE," Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?",168
23397,JERRY," No, you don't have to buy anything.",168
23398,GEORGE," I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!",168
23399,JERRY, I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?,168
23400,GEORGE, I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.,168
23401,JERRY, Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!,168
23402,GEORGE," Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.",168
23403,JERRY, Your good friend is morbidly obese.,168
23404,GEORGE," Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.",168
23405,JERRY, It's not a purse. It's European!,168
23406,KRAMER," All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.",168
23407,JERRY, All right.,168
23408,KRAMER, There you go.,168
23409,JERRY, How do I look?,168
23410,KRAMER, Ahh....,168
23411,GEORGE," Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.",168
23412,GEORGE, My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!,168
23413,JERRY," Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.",168
23414,SILVIO, That is your coat?,168
23415,JERRY, It sure is.,168
23416,SILVIO, Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention.,168
23417,JERRY, That's true.,168
23418,KRAMER," Jerry, you forgot your purse.",168
23419,JERRY," Oh, thanks.",168
23420,KRAMER," Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.",168
23421,JERRY, Maybe this isn't my coat.,168
23422,KRAMER," All right, you're not fancy!",168
23423,SILVIO," No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!",168
23424,ELAINE," Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.",168
23425,JERRY," No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.",168
23426,ELAINE," No, that's not your coat.",168
23427,SILVIO," If that is not his coat, whose coat is it?",168
23428,ELAINE, It's Joe Mayo's coat.,168
23429,SILVIO, Who's Joe Mayo?,168
23430,KRAMER, That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.,168
23431,JERRY, Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!,168
23432,COP, Your what?,168
23433,JERRY," The...black, leather...thing with a strap.",168
23434,COP, You mean a purse?,168
23435,JERRY," Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!",168
23436,JERRY," So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?",168
23437,ELAINE," Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.",168
23438,JERRY, He should have had a reverse peephole.,168
23439,PUDDY," Hey, Babe.",168
23440,JERRY, Hello? Hello?,168
23441,ELAINE, What is that?,168
23442,PUDDY, It's my new coat.,168
23443,ELAINE, You ditched the fur?,168
23444,PUDDY," Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.",168
23445,ELAINE, You're gonna wear this all the time?,168
23446,PUDDY, All signs point to 'Yes!',168
23447,JERRY, So your saying UNICEF is a scam?,169
23448,KRAMER, It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.,169
23449,JERRY, Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.,169
23450,KRAMER, Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?,169
23451,JERRY," No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.",169
23452,KRAMER," Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh!",169
23453,JERRY," Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.",169
23454,KRAMER, Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.,169
23455,JERRY, She should just give up.,169
23456,JERRY, Heeyyy!...,169
23457,SALLY, Hey there Mr. Too big to come to my shows. I just came back from  Whoooooooo.....I'm on my way to an audition still waiting for that big break.,169
23458,KRAMER, Why don't you just give up?,169
23459,JERRY, Kramer!!!,169
23460,KRAMER," At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?",169
23461,JERRY, So......Susan's dead.....,169
23462,KRAMER, I think she was happy someone finally said it.,169
23463,JERRY, Why'd you have to say anything to her?,169
23464,KRAMER, 'felt that the conversation was lagging.,169
23465,JERRY, Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?,169
23466,KRAMER, I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.,169
23467,ELAINE," You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.",169
23468,JERRY, What did you wanna be?,169
23469,ELAINE," I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.",169
23470,JERRY, I don't either.,169
23471,ELAINE, And you're on the fringe of the humor business.,169
23472,GEORGE, Hey!,169
23473,ELAINE, Hey! George look at this.,169
23474,GEORGE, That's cute.,169
23475,ELAINE, You got it?,169
23476,GEORGE," No, never mind.",169
23477,ELAINE," Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.",169
23478,JERRY, It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.,169
23479,ELAINE," The cat is saying "" I've enjoyed reading your E-mail"".",169
23480,GEORGE, Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .,169
23481,ELAINE, It's a page number.,169
23482,GEORGE," Well, I can't crack this one.",169
23483,ELAINE, Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.,169
23484,GEORGE," try shaking it... Well,Janet should be here any minute.",169
23485,JERRY, You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?,169
23486,GEORGE," Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose",169
23487,ELAINE, We know what a face consists of.,169

23489,GEORGE," Jerry, Elaine, I give you.. Janet.",169
23490,JANET, Nice to meet you.,169
23491,ELAINE, Hi!,169
23492,JANET, Do we still have time to make the movie?,169
23493,GEORGE, Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.,169
23494,ELAINE," Jerry, She looks exactly like you.",169
23495,JERRY, She does not.,169
23496,ELAINE," Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.",169
23497,JERRY, Hey! Kramer.,169
23498,KRAMER," hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said ""Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.",169
23499,JERRY, What! You're the one who ruined her life.,169
23500,KRAMER, Well that's not how she remembers it.,169
23501,JERRY," Well, I got to talk her out of this.",169
23502,KRAMER, I thought you said she stinks,169
23503,JERRY, She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.,169
23504,JERRY, Yeah...,169
23505,GEORGE, Hey! George and Janet.,169
23506,KRAMER, Aahh...Who's Janet?,169
23507,JERRY," George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.",169
23508,KRAMER, You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.,169
23509,ALL," Hey, Hey!",169
23510,KRAMER, And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.,169
23511,GEORGE," Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry",169
23512,JANET, well maybe we do look a little like each other.,169
23513,GEORGE," No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.",169
23514,KRAMER, C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.,169
23515,GEORGE,  All right now we're going bye bye.,169
23516,JANET, We just got here George,169
23517,GEORGE," Well,,, it's getting dark.",169
23518,KRAMER," yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.",169
23519,JERRY, What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I,169
23520,KRAMER," Well how should I have ""broached the subject""",169
23521,JERRY," You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.",169
23522,KRAMER, Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.,169
23523,JERRY, Yeah! Because of you.,169
23524,KRAMER," Well, I think one of us should leave.",169
23525,JERRY," Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.",169
23526,SALLY,  Hehumm!!,169
23527,JERRY," You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic.",169
23528,SALLY, Really?,169
23529,JERRY," Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..",169
23530,SALLY, Yeah! You've been stinking since the Eighties.,169
23531,JERRY," All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.",169
23532,SALLY," Right!, Yesss!! Thank you I'm gonna do it. ",169
23533,JERRY, NOW!!!!.... ,169
23534,ELAINE," Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.",169
23535,JERRY, Oh! I think we're at the bottom.,169
23536,ELAINE,"  Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.",169
23537,GEORGE, What does that mean?,169

23546,GEORGE, Yes.,169
23547,JERRY, For either one of us..,169
23548,GEORGE, No...,169
23549,JERRY, So...,169

23557,JERRY," What's happening? What, you doing, come and talk to us.",169

23561,KRAMER, Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry,169
23562,GEORGE, What's the decision?,169

23564,JERRY, Yeah right.,169
23565,KRAMER," What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.",169
23566,GEORGE, Silence YES!!,169
23567,JERRY, Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.,169
23568,KRAMER," Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.",169
23569,JERRY, Well what does this mean?,169
23570,KRAMER, Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.,169
23571,GEORGE,"  SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...",169
23572,KRAMER, That's the idea.,169

23574,KRAMER,  ..Weeeeeepp!!,169
23575,JERRY, Oh! you just startin' now?,169

23580,MR. ELINOFF, Oh! yeah... That's a rather clever jab at inter office politics don't you think.,169
23581,ELAINE," Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?",169
23582,MR. ELINOFF, Well Miss Benes . Cartoons are like gossamer and one doesn't dissect gossamer. heh..hemm..,169
23583,ELAINE, Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?,169
23584,MR. ELINOFF, Ha! It's merely a commentary on contemporary mores. ,169
23585,ELAINE," But, what is the comment. ",169
23586,MR. ELINOFF, It's a slice of life.,169
23587,ELAINE, No it isn't.,169

23609,JERRY," Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew",169

23620,SALLY, Well...That is the title.,169

23669,ELAINE, A Ziggy?,169
23670,PETERMAN," That irreverence, that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine, to my archives.",169

23696,ELAINE, Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on ,169
23697,JERRY," Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.",169
23698,SALLY,  Master of Evil Jerry Seinfeld has broke off all contacts with me.,169
23699,JERRY, That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?,169
23700,ELAINE, Why are you yelling at the TV?,169
23701,SALLY, ..OK get this; I heard he makes his best friend date women that look just like him.Hello issues..,169
23702,JERRY," Elaine, have you been talking to her?",169
23703,ELAINE, Hey! I'm just a fan..ha ha...,169
23704,SALLY, Oh and speaking of issues . Guess who got a no-polish manicure and begged his neighbor not to tell anyone?,169
23705,JERRY,  I thought you stopped talking??,169
23706,KRAMER, ...All right ..Starting now......,169
23707,JERRY, You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?,169
23708,GEORGE, like that ,169
23709,JERRY, You mean like.. ,169
23710,GEORGE, ..That.,169
23711,JERRY, So she..,169
23712,GEORGE, Yes..,169
23713,JERRY, And you don't...,169
23714,GEORGE, Nooo...,169
23715,JERRY, So...,169
23716,GEORGE, Exactly..,169
23717,JERRY, Hmmmm...,169
23718,GEORGE, We...must never ever speak of this again..,169
23719,JERRY," No, no...... Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?",169
23720,GEORGE, Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off ,169
23721,JERRY, I think that's for the best.,169
23722,JERRY," I'm not a foodie. I don't, ""Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty."" Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? ""Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.."" What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?",17
23723,ELAINE, Do you want some of mine?,17
23724,JERRY, Take some of mine.,17
23725,GEORGE," Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.",17
23726,JERRY, Who said you have to like it?,17
23727,GEORGE," Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.",17
23728,JERRY, I don't like pesto.,17
23729,GEORGE, Where was pesto 10 years ago?,17
23730,JERRY,"  Look at that guy.  I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.",17
23731,ELAINE,"  The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um..  Oh yeah, plugola.",17
23732,JERRY,"  Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.",17
23733,GEORGE, That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.,17
23734,JERRY, I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.,17
23735,GEORGE, Who?,17
23736,JERRY," Elaine is having a ""houseguest."" She's picking him up at the airport tonight.",17
23737,GEORGE, A guy?,17
23738,ELAINE,"  Yes, a guy.",17
23739,JERRY," He's from a.. Yakima, right?",17
23740,ELAINE, Seattle.,17
23741,JERRY, Everybody's moving to Seattle.,17
23742,GEORGE, It's the pesto of cities. So..?,17
23743,ELAINE,  You tell him.,17
23744,JERRY," Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.",17
23745,ELAINE, Ed.,17
23746,JERRY," Who was in town on a business venture, and um..",17
23747,ELAINE, ..We shared an interpersonal experience.  Go on.,17
23748,JERRY," So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.",17
23749,ELAINE, On some people.,17
23750,GEORGE, Oooh.,17
23751,JERRY," So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.",17
23752,ELAINE," It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.",17
23753,MANAGER, What happened?,17
23754,GEORGE," Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.",17
23755,MANAGER, Sorry to the disturbance.,17
23756,ELAINE,  I'm never eating here again.,17
23757,JERRY,"  Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert..  I think the busboy's in trouble.",17
23758,GEORGE, Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose..  He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!,17
23759,ELAINE," I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.",17
23760,JERRY,  I didn't say anything.,17
23761,GEORGE, I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!,17
23762,ELAINE," Oh, I said it in a kidding way.",17
23763,GEORGE, I didn't know he'd get fired.,17
23764,JERRY,  He'll probably kill his family over this.,17
23765,GEORGE, What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!,17
23766,JERRY,  A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.,17
23767,GEORGE, Was it my fault?,17
23768,ELAINE, Was it my fault?,17
23769,JERRY,  ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.,17
23770,JERRY," Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.",17
23771,GEORGE,"  Oh, like you really know busboys.",17
23772,JERRY," Oh, like you do.",17
23773,GEORGE," Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.",17
23774,JERRY,  Camp.,17
23775,GEORGE, It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.,17
23776,JERRY, Elaine?,17
23777,ELAINE,  Yeah.,17
23778,JERRY, Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.,17
23779,GEORGE, Then why don't you try and get him another job?,17
23780,JERRY," I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.",17
23781,ELAINE," I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.",17
23782,GEORGE, What? Did you get the busboy's number?,17
23783,ELAINE," His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D.  Now, I did my job.  May I have the car keys, please?",17
23784,GEORGE, How did you get all this?,17
23785,ELAINE," Does the word ""charm"" mean anything to you?",17
23786,JERRY, No.  So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.,17
23787,GEORGE,  I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.,17
23788,JERRY," You, you're going now?",17
23789,GEORGE," Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.",17
23790,JERRY, Maybe the fat camp.  You're not going?,17
23791,ELAINE," I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.",17
23792,JERRY, I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?,17
23793,GEORGE, It'll take to long.,17
23794,JERRY, Take the K-man. A little support..,17
23795,GEORGE,  I don't a..,17
23796,KRAMER, Take me where? Where?,17
23797,GEORGE," Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.",17
23798,KRAMER, What am I gonna say?,17
23799,GEORGE, I don't know.,17
23800,KRAMER," Well, I'm not an idiot.",17
23801,GEORGE, Certainly not.,17
23802,KRAMER, Then we're cool.,17
23803,GEORGE," Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool.  Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened.  I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired.  And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.",17
23804,KRAMER,  He's a hell of a guy.,17
23805,GEORGE, This is a guy I know.. Kramer.,17
23806,KRAMER, ¿Habla espanol?,17
23807,GEORGE,  Oh my God.,17
23808,ANTONIO, Si.,17
23809,KRAMER, ¿Como se dice.. waterbed?,17
23810,GEORGE,"  Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that.  Well, I guess that's about it.",17
23811,KRAMER, You got anything to drink? ¿Agua?,17
23812,GEORGE, Oy uy uy..  We really should get going.,17
23813,KRAMER, Let me get a glass of water. ,17
23814,GEORGE, Hurry up.,17
23815,ANTONIO,  Pequita? Pequita? ,17
23816,KRAMER, His cat's gone.,17
23817,ANTONIO,"  La puerta esta abierta.  La puerta esta abierta!  Who left the door open?  Who left the door open?!  Come on, come on! Help me look! ",17
23818,KRAMER," ..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in",17
23819,GEORGE,"  Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat..  the lamp.",17
23820,KRAMER, The wire was sticking out..  Yeah.,17
23821,GEORGE,"  Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer..  ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. ",17
23822,KRAMER, You oughta get that wire fixed.  I got the door. ,17
23823,JERRY,"  George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.",17
23824,KRAMER, Hey.,17
23825,JERRY,  Hey.  He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?..  That's Elaine.  Kramer..  George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.,17
23826,KRAMER, It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.,17
23827,JERRY,  Kramer says it's up to the cat now.  It'll be on your conscience.,17
23828,KRAMER, Oh? How do you figure?,17
23829,JERRY,  How do you figure?  'Cause you're the one who left the door open.,17
23830,KRAMER, Why was I in charge of closing the door?,17
23831,JERRY,  Why was he in charge of closing the door?  'Cause you came in after him!,17
23832,KRAMER, So!,17
23833,JERRY,"  So!  So, the last person in should close the door!",17
23834,KRAMER, Let me talk to him.,17
23835,JERRY,  Talk - call him from your house.  He's calling you now.. okay. ,17
23836,ELAINE, Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?,17
23837,JERRY, No hello?,17
23838,ELAINE," Got any asprin?  Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?",17
23839,JERRY," Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car.",17
23840,ELAINE," Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.",17
23841,JERRY,"  So, did you have a nice week together?",17
23842,ELAINE, I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?,17
23843,JERRY, There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?,17
23844,ELAINE," Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!",17
23845,JERRY," So, you two been, uh..",17
23846,ELAIEN," No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..",17
23847,JERRY, What's your airport route?,17
23848,ELAINE, I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.,17
23849,JERRY, ..What about the Van Wyck?,17
23850,ELAINE," I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.",17
23851,JERRY, Oooh.,17
23852,ELAINE," Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 10",17
23853,JERRY, You still using that old alarm clock?,17
23854,ELAIEN," Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in the face.",17
23855,JERRY," Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, ""Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land.""  ""I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago?  Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second..  Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you.""",17
23856,ELAINE,  Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off!  It's 9,17
23857,ED, 9,17
23858,ELAINE, Yes! 9,17
23859,ED,  We'll never make it. I'll leave tomarrow.,17
23860,ELAINE," Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go!  You get dressed! Get dressed!",17
23861,ED, Can I shower?,17
23862,ELAINE, Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!,17
23863,ED, I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.,17
23864,ELAINE, Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on!  Where are you going?,17
23865,ED, The kitchen.,17
23866,ELAINE, The kitchen?!,17
23867,ED, I've got a bag of cashews in there.,17
23868,ELAINE, They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!,17
23869,ED, What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomarrow or the next day.,17
23870,ELAINE, No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!,17
23871,ED, I'll never make it.,17
23872,ELAINE, Don't say that!,17
23873,ED, But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane.,17
23874,ELAINE, Shut up and pack!,17
23875,ED, And what if I don't make the plane? You'll have already left. Then what will I do?,17
23876,ELAINE, You're talking too much!,17
23877,ED, Where's my sweater?,17
23878,ELAINE, What?!,17
23879,ED, My brown sweater.,17
23880,ELAINE, What? What sweater?,17
23881,ED, My brown sweater.,17
23882,ELAINE, You didn't bring a brown sweater.,17
23883,ED, I brought a brown sweater.,17
23884,ELAINE, Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?!  You got a brown sweater!,17
23885,ED, That's not mine. I can't take your sweater.,17
23886,ELAINE, It's brown! ,17
23887,ED, What are you doing?!,17
23888,ELAINE, NO time for folding..  I think that's it. ,17
23889,ED, My shoes. You packed my shoes.,17
23890,ELAINE, Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them!  I got this. Let's go!,17
23891,JERRY, Anywhere in the city?,17
23892,GEORGE, Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.,17
23893,JERRY, Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?,17
23894,GEORGE," Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.",17
23895,JERRY, Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.,17
23896,GEORGE,"  ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.",17
23897,ELAINE,"  I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.",17
23898,KRAMER, ..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!,17
23899,GEORGE, The busboy's coming?,17
23900,JERRY, You don't mean here?,17
23901,KRAMER, Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..,17
23902,GEORGE, He's coming up?!  I'll check you out later.,17
23903,JERRY, Where are you going?,17
23904,GEORGE, I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.,17
23905,JERRY,  No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.,17
23906,KRAMER," No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.",17
23907,GEORGE," Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..",17
23908,KRAMER, Antonio. In here!,17
23909,GEORGE,"  Hey, Antonio. How's it going?",17
23910,ANTONIO," Three nights ago, a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded, killing five people in my section, including the busboy who replaced me. If I am not fired that night because of you and your thoughtless, stupid, insensitive remarks, it would have been me. You saved my life. ",17
23911,GEORGE,"  Ah, come on..",17
23912,ELAINE,  Yeah?,17
23913,ED, It's Eddie.,17
23914,ELAINE, He's coming up.  He's coming up..,17
23915,ANTONIO," And that very same night of the accident, while looking for Pequita, I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making before - and when I returned to the apartment, Pequita, perhaps frightened from the explosion, had miraculously returned. Well, but now, I must go, for today I am starting my new and wonderful job. And I am very late. Thank you, thank you, thank you all. ",17
23916,ED," Hey, watch were you're going. You almost knocked my head off!",17
23917,ANTONIO," Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, okay? 'Cause you bumped into me!",17
23918,ED," Who do you think you're talking to, pal?",17
23919,ANTONIO," Hey, get your hands off me!",17
23920,ED, Go to hell!,17
23921,JERRY, He'll get another job. He's a busboy!,17
23922,GEORGE, It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.,17
23923,JERRY, It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.,17
23924,GEORGE, That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.,17
23925,ELAINE," Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio.  ..Thanks.",17
23926,GEORGE," So, much longer?",17
23927,ELAINE," Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?",17
23928,GEORGE,  I guess it's not important.,17
23929,ELAINE, Take care of yourselves. ,17
23930,GEORGE," I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.",17
23931,JERRY, Yeah..  How ya doing?,17
23932,JERRY," First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, ""Didn't you see my signal?"" ""Look at that fender!"" ..Then you'd see a real fight.",17
23933,GEORGE,"  Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up.",170
23934,MAURA, No. ,170
23935,GEORGE,  What's that?,170
23936,MAURA, We're not breaking up. ,170
23937,GEORGE,  W-we're not?,170
23938,MAURA, No. ,170
23939,GEORGE, All right ,170
23940,JERRY, She said no?,170
23941,GEORGE, She said no.,170
23942,JERRY, What did you do?,170
23943,GEORGE, What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!,170
23944,JERRY," George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.",170
23945,GEORGE," Well, I don't really like her.",170
23946,JERRY, That's good.,170
23947,GEORGE, I don't find her attractive.,170
23948,JERRY, Solid.,170
23949,GEORGE, I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.,170
23950,JERRY, Always popular.,170
23951,GEORGE, Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food,170
23952,JERRY, You have an airtight case!,170
23953,GEORGE, And in bed--,170
23954,JERRY, I'm afraid we're out of time.,170
23955,JERRY, Hey.,170
23956,GEORGE, What?,170
23957,JERRY," Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie ""Cinderfella"". I got 'em at an auction.",170
23958,GEORGE, I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.,170
23959,JERRY," No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.",170
23960,GEORGE, You already have an in. You have the same first name!...  'Jerry'!,170
23961,JERRY," Oh, that'll intrigue him.",170
23962,GEORGE," Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.",170
23963,JERRY, George Peppard has been dead for years.,170
23964,GEORGE," Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!",170
23965,GLENN, So you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution?,170
23966,ELAINE," Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...",170
23967,GLENN," So, um, why don't we get together some time?",170
23968,ELAINE," Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?",170
23969,GLENN, I think it'd be better if I called you.,170
23970,ELAINE, Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?,170
23971,GLENN," Mm mm... no, not really.",170
23972,ELAINE," So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?",170
23973,GLENN,  I think you're very beautiful.,170
23974,ELAINE,  Oh  That'll do! ,170
23975,JERRY, What about Puddy?,170
23976,ELAINE," I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...",170
23977,JERRY,"  So, what's this guy about?",170
23978,ELAINE," I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.",170
23979,JERRY," Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!",170
23980,ELAINE, Which one is he?,170
23981,JERRY," Green suit, power ring.",170
23982,ELAINE, I don't care for jewellery on men ,170
23983,KRAMER, Hey. It happened again.  Another robbery in the building.,170
23984,JERRY, So you bought a cooler?,170
23985,KRAMER," No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.",170
23986,ELAINE, And... what would those be?,170
23987,KRAMER," Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.",170
23988,JERRY,  You were in the Army?,170
23989,KRAMER," Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. ",170
23990,ELAINE, Literally.,170
23991,KRAMER,  'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean?  You mind if I hide this somewhere?,170
23992,JERRY," No, go ahead.",170
23993,KRAMER,"  A little... privacy, uh?",170
23994,JERRY," Oh, come on!",170
23995,ELAINE, Oh!,170
23996,KRAMER," Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue!  Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.",170
23997,JERRY,  How long did you last? ,170
23998,KRAMER," Well, that's classified.",170
23999,ELAINE," Hey, what if he's married?",170
24000,JERRY, Kramer?!,170
24001,ELAINE," No, the Green Lantern.",170
24002,KRAMER,  OK!,170
24003,JERRY," So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.",170
24004,ELAINE," Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.",170
24005,KRAMER,  You peeked!,170
24006,JERRY, THIS is your hiding place?! ,170
24007,KRAMER, It was under a spoon!,170
24008,GEORGE," And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up.  Thank you,  and good night.",170
24009,MAURA," No, George, we're not.",170
24010,GEORGE,  But I proved it!,170
24011,MAURA, I refuse to give up on this relationship. It's like... launching missiles from a submarine. Both of us have to turn our keys.,170
24012,GEORGE," Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.",170
24013,MAURA,"  I'm sorry, George, I can't do that.",170
24014,GEORGE,"  Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!",170
24015,ELAINE," So, how is a guy like you not involved?",170
24016,GLENN, I might ask you the same thing.,170
24017,ELAINE,"  That's true, maybe he's not married.",170
24018,ELAINE," Oh, that is so sweet.",170
24019,ELAINE,  How long do I have to hold this?,170
24020,GLENN,"  Oh, no.",170
24021,ELAINE, Who is it?,170
24022,GLENN," Um, uh, no one, no one.  Here, uh, let me show you a short cut. Come on. Come on.",170
24023,ELAINE,"  Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. ",170
24024,ELAINE,  Jerry! Jerry!,170
24025,JERRY," Elaine, what are you doin' down there?",170
24026,ELAINE, You didn't hear me buzzing?,170
24027,JERRY," Oh, I guess it's broken!",170
24028,ELAINE, Throw down your key.,170
24029,JERRY, It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.,170
24030,ELAINE, I'll catch it!,170
24031,JERRY, You'll chicken out at the last second.,170
24032,ELAINE," ...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?",170
24033,JERRY,"  All right.  Hey, you know what's weird?",170
24034,ELAINE, Huh?,170
24035,JERRY, I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.,170
24036,ELAINE," Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!",170
24037,JERRY, All right.,170
24038,JERRY, Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.,170
24039,ELAINE,  It went in the sewer! ,170
24040,JERRY, Hey...,170
24041,KRAMER,  What are you doin'?,170
24042,JERRY,  You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!,170
24043,KRAMER,"  You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.",170
24044,JERRY, I'm gonna go let Elaine in. ,170
24045,KRAMER," Oo, y- what are you doing with her? ",170
24046,JERRY,  Kramer!,170
24047,KRAMER,  Security issue!,170
24048,JERRY," Oh, hey. You got in.",170
24049,ELAINE," Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. ",170
24050,JERRY,"  Oh, thanks.",170
24051,KRAMER,  That wasn't me!,170
24052,JERRY," So, he's definitely married, huh?",170
24053,ELAINE, Uh...,170
24054,JERRY," Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.",170
24055,JERRY," Oh, come on!",170
24056,ELAINE," Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.",170
24057,KRAMER,  OK! ,170
24058,KRAMER," All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. ",170
24059,GEORGE,  Jerry!,170
24060,JERRY,"  George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!",170
24061,JERRY,  I believe this belongs to you.,170
24062,KRAMER, Heyyyy! ,170
24063,JERRY,  Where did you get that?,170
24064,GEORGE,  I bought it. ,170
24065,JERRY,  I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.,170
24066,PHIL, What?,170
24067,JERRY, There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.,170
24068,PHIL," But, I live here! I ran out to buy some birdseed, and-and I forgot my key.",170
24069,GEORGE, Sounds like a scam. ,170
24070,JERRY,  I'm very sorry. ,170
24071,GEORGE," So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.",170
24072,JERRY," Great, you're lonely and miserable again. ",170
24073,GEORGE, Feels right. ,170
24074,JERRY, Is that guy still there? ,170
24075,GEORGE,  He's starin' at us.,170
24076,JERRY, Don't look at him. ,170
24077,JERRY, We don't hear that. ,170
24078,GEORGE, Want a bite?,170
24079,JERRY," Nooo, I don't. ",170
24080,GEORGE,"  I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. ",170
24081,MAURA,"  Hey, Honey. ",170
24082,GEORGE,"  What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!",170
24083,MAURA," George, you didn't mean that. That was just a fight.",170
24084,GEORGE, Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?,170
24085,MAURA," George, I listened to your arguments, and they were rambling and flimsy. I'm not convinced. Come on, get dressed and let's get some dinner.",170
24086,GEORGE,  All right. ,170
24087,MAURA,"  Eww, Mr. Apple. You have a brown spot. ",170
24088,ELAINE," So, this is your little... love nest? ",170
24089,GLENN," It's nothing special, just a little place I keep.",170
24090,ELAINE, Oh.,170
24091,GLENN," Ah, should I light a fire?",170
24092,ELAINE," Oh, that sounds... romantic.",170
24093,GLENN," I'm having a little problem with the heat. Um, I got some cardboard out here. ",170
24094,ELAINE,  This is wrong. I should go. ,170
24095,GLENN,"  Can you get that, please?",170
24096,ELAINE," Oh, sure.",170
24097,WOMAN, Where's Glenn?,170
24098,ELAINE,"  Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.",170
24099,WOMAN," Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?",170
24100,ELAINE, This is his home?,170
24101,WOMAN, Yes.,170
24102,ELAINE," So, he's...",170
24103,WOMAN,  Poor. ,170
24104,GLENN,  I think this will burn!,170
24105,JERRY, So you do live here.,170
24106,PHIL,  Yeah. ,170
24107,JERRY, You live on this floor?,170
24108,PHIL, Yeah.,170
24109,JERRY,  So you live right... there.,170
24110,PHIL, Yeah. ,170
24111,JERRY, So I guess I'll s--,170
24112,ELAINE, He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone.  He's not married. He's poor. ,170
24113,JERRY, Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?,170
24114,ELAINE, He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.,170
24115,JERRY," So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?",170
24116,ELAINE, How can I end it over money? I feel bad.,170
24117,JERRY," Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?",170
24118,ELAINE, Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.,170
24119,JERRY, Good. How did you handle that?,170
24120,ELAINE," Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.",170
24121,JERRY," Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.",170
24122,ELAINE," Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?",170
24123,GEORGE,  Hey.,170
24124,JERRY," Hey, where have you been?",170
24125,GEORGE,"  Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.",170
24126,ELAINE," If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.",170
24127,GEORGE," Who's this, Blue Arrow?",170
24128,ELAINE, Green Lantern.,170
24129,JERRY, We found out his super power was lack of money.,170
24130,ELAINE,  All right.,170
24131,JERRY, He's invulnerable to creditors.,170
24132,ELAINE,  We get it. ,170
24133,JERRY, He's the Got-no-Green Lantern.,170
24134,ELAINE, Thank you. ,170
24135,GEORGE," Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.",170
24136,ELAINE,"  Ooh,  well crafted. ",170
24137,GEORGE," Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.",170
24138,JERRY," Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.",170
24139,GEORGE," She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.",170
24140,JERRY, ... Could you move over there?!,170
24141,GEORGE," Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.",170
24142,JERRY, Really? How come you never pursued her before?,170
24143,GEORGE," She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.",170
24144,ELAINE,  Did I leave my glasses here?,170
24145,JERRY,  He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!,170
24146,ELAINE,  Keep 'em! ,170
24147,KRAMER, Heh.,170
24148,JERRY, There's a giant parrot in the hallway.,170
24149,KRAMER, It's Phil's.,170
24150,JERRY, Who?,170
24151,KRAMER," Our neighbor that you... turned against.  Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.",170
24152,JERRY, What'd ya tell him that for?,170
24153,KRAMER," Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.",170
24154,JERRY, Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?,170
24155,KRAMER," Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...",170
24156,JERRY, He let you?,170
24157,KRAMER," No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh,  Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! ",170
24158,GEORGE," So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?",170
24159,LORETTA, I was in Maine for a couple days. ,170
24160,GEORGE, Well...  heeere we are ,170
24161,LORETTA," George, I've always fantasized about jumping into bed with you.",170
24162,GEORGE,  Ho ho! ,170
24163,LORETTA, But... I don't want to spoil things by sleeping with you too soon.,170
24164,GEORGE,  Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.,170
24165,LORETTA," I want to build something with you, George.",170
24166,GEORGE," Oh, not more building.",170
24167,LORETTA,  And I won't take no for an answer. ,170
24168,GEORGE, No?,170
24169,LORETTA, No.,170
24170,GEORGE,  All right. ,170
24171,ELAINE," So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?",170
24172,GLENN, It's a surprise.,170
24173,ELAINE,  Oh.,170
24174,ELAINE, What are you doing? What is that?,170
24175,GLENN, It's a bag of donuts.,170
24176,ELAINE, It's garbage.,170
24177,GLENN," No, no, no, no. When they make the new ones, the old ones come out... right here.",170
24178,ELAINE,"  All right, that's it.  How do you spell your last name?",170
24179,GLENN,  It's a bear claw! You have no idea how rare this is.,170
24180,ELAINE,  I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?,170
24181,GLENN,  Oooh!,170
24182,ELAINE, Make it three hundred.,170
24183,GLENN,"  You know, Elaine, you're the bear claw in the garbage bag of my life. ",170
24184,ELAINE,"  Aw, Glenn.",170
24185,JERRY, Hi. Is Phil here?,170
24186,JERRY," Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.",170
24187,PHIL, And?,170
24188,JERRY," I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.",170
24189,PHIL, That's my wife.,170
24190,JERRY,"  All right, I think we're done here. ",170
24191,JERRY,"  So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.",170
24192,GEORGE, This isn't going well.,170
24193,JERRY," I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!",170
24194,GEORGE, You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name!  'Jerry'! ,170
24195,JERRY, Where are you goin'? Help me look!,170
24196,GEORGE,"  It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of ""Godspell"" with the other.",170
24197,JERRY, Which is with who?,170
24198,GEORGE,  It doesn't matter. ,170
24199,KRAMER,"  Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.",170
24200,JERRY, I can't go until I find my cufflinks.,170
24201,KRAMER," Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.",170
24202,JERRY," You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?",170
24203,KRAMER," Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?",170
24204,KRAMER," Hey, what's going on?",170
24205,PHIL, Fredo is dead. ,170
24206,JERRY, That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?,170
24207,PHIL, No! My bird. We just got back from the pet cemetery. ,170
24208,JERRY," Oh, Phil... Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.",170
24209,PHIL," Oh, I'll bet you are! They told us he was poisoned! Something in his food.",170
24210,JERRY," But I, I didn't, I--",170
24211,JERRY," Kramer, they think I killed Fredo!  And who buries a bird?",170
24212,KRAMER," Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.",170
24213,JERRY, Just get the key and let's get out of here.,170
24214,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.",170
24215,JERRY, Kramer!? ,170
24216,KRAMER, What?,170
24217,JERRY, You killed Fredo!,170
24218,KRAMER,"  Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!",170
24219,JERRY," Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?",170
24220,KRAMER, You just answered your own question.,170
24221,JERRY,"  Oh, no!",170
24222,KRAMER,  I'll get the shovel. ,170
24223,GEORGE," The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.",170
24224,LORETTA,  What?,170
24225,GEORGE," I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.",170
24226,LORETTA, Oh. ,170
24227,MAURA, George?,170
24228,GEORGE," Maura.  Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!",170
24229,MAURA, You told me to meet you here for lunch.,170
24230,GEORGE,  Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! ,170
24231,MAURA,  I'm Maura. ,170
24232,LORETTA,  I'm Loretta. You want to join us? ,170
24233,GEORGE,"  This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives...  Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... ",170
24234,MAURA," George, what we have is too important. We can work through this.",170
24235,LORETTA, So can we.,170
24236,GEORGE,"  What? So, this is still not over?",170

24243,GLENN," Oh, my God, Alison. You're home early.",170
24244,ELAINE, Who is this?,170
24245,ALISON,  His wife.,170

24247,GLENN, Looks like it.,170
24248,ALISON, Who the hell are you?,170
24249,ELAINE, I guess I'm... Lois Loan.,170
24250,JERRY," Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers.",170
24251,KRAMER,"  'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.",170
24252,JERRY,"  Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! ",170
24253,KRAMER,"  All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.",170
24254,JERRY,  I'll dig.,170
24255,KRAMER," Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.",170
24256,JERRY,"  Well, that was easy.",170
24257,PHIL," All right, Honey, one last look, then you have to let Fredo rest in peace.",170
24258,JERRY,"  Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!",170
24259,PHIL,"  Oh, my God!",170
24260,JERRY,"  Hey, neighbor.",170
24261,GEORGE, All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each...  What do you think?,170
24262,ELAINE," Give me forty, you'll never see me again.",170
24263,ELAINE,"  So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?",170
24264,JERRY,"  Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.",170
24265,GEORGE," So, what's in the cooler? ",170
24266,KRAMER," Oh. Well, would you look at that.  I guess I forgot to lock it.",170
24267,JERRY, You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?,170
24268,KRAMER," Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!",170
24269,GEORGE, When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner?  What's that?,171
24270,JERRY, It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.,171
24271,GEORGE, How much was it?,171
24272,JERRY, Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.,171
24273,GEORGE, Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?,171
24274,JERRY," Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.",171
24275,GEORGE, I got a message from the Rosses at work today.,171
24276,JERRY, Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?,171
24277,GEORGE," At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.",171
24278,JERRY," Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.",171
24279,ELAINE,"  Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.",171
24280,DARRYL," Nice meeting you. Ah, I gotta run, Elaine. I'll see you later.",171
24281,ELAINE, OK.,171
24282,JERRY, Still no Puddy?,171
24283,ELAINE," Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?",171
24284,JERRY, What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?,171
24285,ELAINE, What black guy?,171
24286,JERRY," Darryl. He's black, isn't he?",171
24287,ELAINE, He is?,171
24288,GEORGE," No, he isn't.",171
24289,JERRY," Isn't he, Elaine?",171
24290,ELAINE, You think?,171
24291,GEORGE, I thought he looked Irish.,171
24292,JERRY, What's his last name?,171
24293,ELAINE, Nelson.,171
24294,GEORGE, That's not Irish.,171
24295,JERRY, I think he's black.,171
24296,GEORGE, Should we be talkin' about this?,171
24297,ELAINE, I think it's OK.,171
24298,GEORGE," No, it isn't.",171
24299,JERRY, Why not?,171
24300,GEORGE," Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.",171
24301,JERRY, If he's black.,171
24302,ELAINE, Is he black?,171
24303,JERRY, Does it matter?,171
24304,ELAINE," No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.",171
24305,JERRY," Oh, so you need to know?",171
24306,ELAINE," No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.",171
24307,WAITRESS, Should I take that?,171
24308,JERRY,"  Uh, one second.",171
24309,ELAINE,"  Oh, here.",171
24310,GEORGE,"  Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.",171
24311,GEORGE,"  Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.",171
24312,MRS. ROSS," Uh, who?",171
24313,GEORGE," George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.",171
24314,MR. ROSS,  We're all out of lime juice. I told that woman to buy more.,171
24315,MRS. ROSS," Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this weekend.",171
24316,GEORGE," Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.",171
24317,MR. ROSS,  I'm goin' back to bed.,171
24318,MRS. ROSS," Thank you for calling, George.",171
24319,GEORGE," Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.",171
24320,JERRY, House in the Hamptons?,171
24321,GEORGE," Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.",171
24322,KRAMER,  Well.,171
24323,JERRY, Hey.,171
24324,KRAMER," Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.",171
24325,JERRY, Wow. What are we celebrating?,171
24326,KRAMER," Uh, you remember my coffee table book?",171
24327,JERRY, With the little legs?,171
24328,KRAMER, That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.,171
24329,GEORGE, How are they gonna make that book into a movie?,171
24330,KRAMER, You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?,171
24331,GEORGE, Yeah?,171
24332,KRAMER, Independence Day?,171
24333,GEORGE, Oh.,171
24334,JERRY, How much are they payin' you?,171
24335,KRAMER, Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.,171
24336,JERRY, That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.,171
24337,KRAMER," Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.",171
24338,JERRY, From what?,171
24339,KRAMER," From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.",171
24340,JERRY,  What's that?,171
24341,KRAMER," Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.",171
24342,KRAMER," Well, it's not really gold.",171
24343,ELAINE,  Hey.,171
24344,DARRYL, Hey.,171
24345,ELAINE, Great music.,171
24346,DARRYL," Oh, it's my neighbor. They blast that stuff twenty four hours a day. I hate it.",171
24347,DARRYL," Yo, you! Turn it down!",171
24348,ELAINE," Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?",171
24349,DARRYL, They're... African.,171
24350,ELAINE, Right. African.,171
24351,DARRYL," Well, not Africa, actually. South Africa.",171
24352,ELAINE, South Africa.,171
24353,DARRYL," My family used to live there, but, uh, we got out years ago, for obvious reasons. You know how it is.",171
24354,ELAINE, Maybe.,171
24355,GEORGE,"  You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.",171
24356,GEORGE," I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.",171
24357,VENDER, Are you gonna buy a hot dog or not?,171
24358,GEORGE, Mmm... no.,171
24359,MORTY,"  Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!",171
24360,JERRY, It's 5,171
24361,HELEN, We let you sleep in.,171
24362,JERRY,"  Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.",171
24363,MORTY," Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.",171
24364,JERRY, What does that mean?,171
24365,HELEN, Leave your father alone. It's his birthday.,171
24366,MORTY, Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.,171
24367,JERRY, Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.,171
24368,MORTY, This looks like too much money.,171
24369,JERRY," Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.",171
24370,MORTY, You think it's hot?,171
24371,JERRY, Could be.,171
24372,MORTY," Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!",171
24373,HELEN, I'm right here.,171
24374,JERRY," And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.",171
24375,MORTY," So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?",171
24376,JERRY," Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.",171
24377,MORTY," Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.",171
24378,HELEN," Jerry, you're getting your father too excited.",171
24379,KRAMER,"  Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?",171
24380,JERRY," Kramer, what are you doing here?",171
24381,KRAMER, I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.,171
24382,HELEN," Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.",171
24383,KRAMER," Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.",171
24384,JERRY," Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.",171
24385,JERRY,  Not you. Older people.,171
24386,HELEN, Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?,171
24387,KRAMER," Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom.",171
24388,JERRY," If you feed him, he'll never leave.",171
24389,HELEN, We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?,171
24390,KRAMER,  I guess.,171
24391,JERRY, I can't believe this.,171
24392,KRAMER," I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?",171
24393,ELAINE," So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?",171
24394,GEORGE," Actually, I did have a thought.",171
24395,ELAINE, Oh.,171
24396,GEORGE, Why don't you just ask him?,171
24397,ELAINE,"  Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.",171
24398,GEORGE," Maybe he's, um... mixed.",171
24399,ELAINE, Is that the right word?,171
24400,GEORGE, I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.,171
24401,ELAINE, Yeah.,171
24402,GEORGE,  I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.,171
24403,ELAINE,"  You know what, I'm leavin'.",171
24404,GEORGE, Yeah.,171
24405,ELAINE," I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back.  Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.",171
24406,MRS. ROSS," Oh, you're George's friend.",171
24407,MR. ROSS," We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh, what happened to his place in the Hamptons?",171
24408,ELAINE,"  The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.",171
24409,GEORGE, Rosses.,171
24410,MR. ROSS," George, we were just talking about you.",171
24411,GEORGE," Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.",171
24412,MRS. ROSS, Really?,171
24413,GEORGE," Yeah, I may move out there.  I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!",171
24414,MORTY,"  Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.",171
24415,JERRY," Dad, it's got lots of other functions.",171
24416,MORTY, Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions.  I can't get it open.,171
24417,HELEN, Yay! Jerry got it open.,171
24418,MORTY, The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?,171
24419,JERRY,"  Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.",171
24420,MORTY, We'll round down.,171
24421,HELEN," Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.",171
24422,JERRY," Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.",171
24423,MORTY, I was never impeached! I resigned!,171
24424,HELEN," Even so, the press would bury him!",171
24425,JERRY, What press?,171
24426,HELEN," The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze.",171
24427,MORTY, Pinko Commie rag.,171
24428,OLD MAN,"  Hey, Morty. Your boy here, he just got a date with that young aquacise instructor.",171
24429,JERRY, She's fifty.,171
24430,OLD MAN, You know what he's got? He's got charisma. That's my man.,171
24431,KRAMER," All right, I'll see you guys.",171
24432,OLD MAN, Yeah.,171
24433,KRAMER, Yeah.,171
24434,KRAMER,"  Morty, what're you lookin' at?",171
24435,MORTY, I'll tell you what I'm looking at,171
24436,KRAMER, Hmm.,171
24437,DARRYL," Elaine, thank you for the Wizard!",171
24438,DARRYL," Wow, it's got so many functions.",171
24439,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...",171
24440,DARRYL," Well, I don't do that stuff.",171
24441,ELAINE," It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one",171
24442,DARRYL, Isn't that optional?,171
24443,ELAINE, It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.,171
24444,DARRYL," All right, I'm... Asian.",171
24445,ELAINE, What?,171
24446,DARRYL, Just to mess with 'em.,171
24447,ELAINE, laughing awkwardly,171
24448,DARRYL," Average income, uh... over a hundred thousand.",171
24449,ELAINE, Really?,171
24450,DARRYL, Does that matter?,171
24451,ELAINE," No, but... it is very nice to know.",171
24452,JERRY,  So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.,171
24453,ELAINE,"  Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.",171
24454,JERRY,  You're a master of race relations.,171
24455,ELAINE," Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?",171
24456,JERRY," Yeah, it's all my father's doing.",171
24457,JERRY, He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.,171
24458,ELAINE," Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?",171
24459,JERRY, Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.,171
24460,GEORGE,  Jerry?,171
24461,ELAINE,  He's still down with his folks.,171
24462,GEORGE,  What are you doin' here?,171
24463,JERRY, (overhearing the other two,171
24464,ELAINE,  I'm gettin' his mail.,171
24465,JERRY,"  Oh, no.",171
24466,GEORGE,  He asked you to get the mail?,171
24467,ELAINE,  Mm-hmm.,171
24468,GEORGE,"  Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?",171
24469,JERRY," George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.",171
24470,ELAINE,  What?,171
24471,GEORGE, What about the mail?,171
24472,JERRY," This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.",171
24473,GEORGE,"  All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.",171
24474,GEORGE," So, I ran into the Rosses again.",171
24475,ELAINE," Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?",171
24476,GEORGE, From me.,171
24477,ELAINE, What did you say?,171
24478,GEORGE, I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?,171
24479,ELAINE, I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.,171
24480,GEORGE," So, they knew? Those liars!",171
24481,ELAINE, But you lied first.,171
24482,GEORGE," Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!",171
24483,ELAINE, Like you're a liar!,171
24484,GEORGE, Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?,171
24485,ELAINE," So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.",171
24486,GEORGE," Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.",171
24487,ELAINE, Haven't you done enough to these people?,171
24488,GEORGE," This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.",171
24489,KRAMER,"  Vote for Kramer.  Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks.  Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.",171
24490,OLD WOMAN, Will you cut my meat?,171
24491,KRAMER, Gladly.,171
24492,WAITRESS,  Coffee?,171
24493,DARRYL, Sure.,171
24494,WAITRESS,  Are you black? Or should I bring some cream.,171
24495,DARRYL," I'm black.  Oh, you know what? Bring a little cream.  Did you hear that?",171
24496,ELAINE, What?,171
24497,DARRYL," God, there are still people who have trouble with an interracial couple.",171
24498,ELAINE, Interracial? Us?,171
24499,DARRYL, Isn't that unbelievable!?,171
24500,ELAINE," Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!",171
24501,DARRYL, I don't feel like eating.,171
24502,ELAINE," Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club.",171
24503,GEORGE, So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.,171
24504,MRS. ROSS, Sounds grand.,171
24505,GEORGE, Do you have your bathing suits?,171
24506,MR. ROSS, It's March.,171
24507,GEORGE," Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!",171
24508,JERRY,"  Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin.  Dad, you look so different.",171
24509,KRAMER," Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.",171
24510,MORTY,  This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!,171
24511,KRAMER," Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.",171
24512,JERRY," You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.",171
24513,MORTY, Daily what?,171
24514,HELEN,  Have you read today's Boca Breeze?,171
24515,KRAMER,"  Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh?  Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.",171
24516,MORTY, Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.,171
24517,KRAMER," Well, I couldn't find my shoes.",171
24518,JERRY," Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.",171
24519,HELEN, Who wants hot chocolate?,171
24520,KRAMER," Oh, yeah! Me.",171
24521,MORTY, This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.,171
24522,KRAMER," All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?",171
24523,JERRY, Wizards!,171
24524,KRAMER," Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.",171
24525,JERRY, Kramer...,171
24526,MORTY, There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.,171
24527,KRAMER," Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?",171
24528,MORTY,"  First, I need a nap.",171
24529,HELEN,"  Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!",171
24530,JERRY," Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.",171
24531,KRAMER," Well, what about your deal, huh?",171
24532,JERRY, I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?,171
24533,KRAMER," Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.",171
24534,JERRY, Down here?,171
24535,KRAMER," Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father.",171
24536,MRS. ROSS, Tell us more.,171
24537,GEORGE, You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.,171
24538,MR. ROSS, Another solarium?,171
24539,GEORGE," Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?",171
24540,MR. ROSS, What are their names?,171
24541,GEORGE, Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?,171
24542,MRS. ROSS," Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a housewarming gift.",171
24543,GEORGE,"  Housewarming gift.  All right, we're taking it up a notch!",171
24544,WAITRESS,  Here you go.,171
24545,ELAINE,  Long day?,171
24546,WAITRESS," Yeah, I just worked a triple shift.",171
24547,ELAINE," I hear ya, Sister.",171
24548,WAITRESS, Sister?,171
24549,ELAINE,  Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?,171
24550,DARRYL," Hi, Elaine.",171
24551,ELAINE, Hey.,171
24552,WAITRESS, He's black?,171
24553,ELAINE, Yeah.,171
24554,DARRYL, I'm black?,171
24555,ELAINE, Aren't you?,171
24556,WAITRESS,  I'll give you a couple minutes to decide.,171
24557,DARRYL, What are you talking about?,171
24558,ELAINE, You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.,171
24559,DARRYL, We are. Because you're Hispanic.,171
24560,ELAINE, I am?,171
24561,DARRYL, Aren't you?,171
24562,ELAINE, No. Why would you think that?,171
24563,DARRYL," Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking me to those Spanish restaurants.",171
24564,ELAINE, That's because I thought you were black.,171
24565,DARRYL, Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because I'm black?,171
24566,ELAINE, I don't think we should be talking about this.,171
24567,DARRYL," So, what are you?",171
24568,ELAINE, I'm white.,171
24569,DARRYL," So, we're just a couple of white people?",171
24570,ELAINE, I guess.,171
24571,DARRYL, Oh.,171
24572,ELAINE, Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?,171
24573,DARRYL,  Sure.,171
24574,KRAMER,"  Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.",171
24575,JERRY, Aw.,171
24576,MORTY," Congratulations, Mr. President.",171
24577,KRAMER," Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master.",171
24578,OLD MAN," Hey, Morty, what's wrong with these tip calculators?",171
24579,MORTY, What are you talking about?,171
24580,OLD MAN, It's overtipping. I just left five bucks for a BLT.,171
24581,MORTY," This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.",171
24582,JERRY," A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!",171
24583,MORTY," Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?",171
24584,JERRY, Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.,171
24585,MORTY, You didn't have a deal?,171
24586,JERRY, No deal. Not hot.,171
24587,OLD MAN," Morty, you, and Kramer, you're finished.",171
24588,KRAMER, What?,171
24589,OLD MAN, Everyone vote for the guy in the wheelchair.,171
24590,KRAMER,"  Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.",171
24591,JERRY," Dad, I'm sorry.",171
24592,MORTY, You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!,171
24593,JERRY, It does other things!,171
24594,MR. ROSS," Where are we, George?",171
24595,GEORGE, Almost there.,171
24596,MR. ROSS," Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your house?",171
24597,GEORGE," We, uh, we go on foot from here.",171
24598,MR. ROSS, All right.,171
24599,GEORGE, There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.,171
24600,MR. ROSS, We know.,171
24601,GEORGE," Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?",171
24602,MRS. ROSS," We don't like you, George.",171
24603,MR. ROSS, And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan.,171
24604,GEORGE, Oh.,171
24605,MR. ROSS, All right! Let's head back.,171
24606,PUDDY," Alright, be careful with the car, babe.",172
24607,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah.",172
24608,PUDDY," And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it.",172
24609,ELAINE, Goodbye?,172
24610,PUDDY," Two and ten, babe.",172
24611,ELAINE, Okay.,172
24612,PUDDY, Don't peel out.,172
24613,ELAINE, I won't.,172
24614,ELAINE, Jesus?,172
24615,KRUGER," According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing is heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts?",172
24616,GEORGE," Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.",172
24617,KRUGER," Works for me. Good thinking, George.",172
24618,GEORGE," Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. ""Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger.""",172
24619,KRUGER," Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real.",172
24620,GEORGE," I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.",172
24621,JERRY, And then?,172
24622,GEORGE, I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.,172
24623,JERRY," Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.",172
24624,GEORGE, I can't just leave.,172
24625,JERRY, That's the way they do it in Vegas.,172
24626,GEORGE, You never played Vegas.,172
24627,JERRY, I hear things.,172
24628,ELAINE, Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.,172
24629,GEORGE, I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.,172
24630,ELAINE," So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?",172
24631,JERRY," It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.",172
24632,ELAINE," Yes, he is lazy.",172
24633,JERRY, Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.,172
24634,ELAINE," Yes, he is dumb.",172
24635,JERRY, So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?,172
24636,ELAINE," Dumb and lazy, I understand.",172
24637,GEORGE, Tell you how you could check.,172
24638,ELAINE, How?,172
24639,GEORGE," Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.",172
24640,JERRY," No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.",172
24641,GEORGE," No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.",172
24642,JERRY," Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.",172
24643,GEORGE, Well that's the gist of it!,172
24644,ELAINE, Quiet! So where is this Sophie?,172
24645,JERRY," Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.",172
24646,ELAINE, How long have you two been together?,172
24647,JERRY," I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?",172
24648,GEORGE," By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?",172
24649,ELAINE, I needed to move a bureau.,172
24650,KRAMER," Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?",172
24651,MICKEY, Hey Jerry.,172
24652,JERRY, Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.,172
24653,KRAMER," Yeah.  See? It should sound like that, something like that.",172
24654,MICKEY, Aah-choo.,172
24655,KRAMER," A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.",172
24656,JERRY, What's with the fake sneezing?,172
24657,KRAMER," Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.",172
24658,MICKEY, They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's an easy gig.,172
24659,JERRY, Do medical schools actually do this?,172
24660,KRAMER," Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.",172
24661,JERRY, I think the phone is ringing.,172
24662,JERRY," Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?",172
24663,KRAMER," Mickey, DTs.",172
24664,JERRY, Hello?,172
24665,SOPHIE, Hey. It's me.,172
24666,JERRY, Elaine?,172
24667,SOPHIE," No, it's me.",172
24668,JERRY, George??,172
24669,SOPHIE," Jerry, it's Sophie. I can't believe you don't recognize my voice.",172
24670,JERRY," Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.",172
24671,KRAMER, You got any Ipecac?,172
24672,JERRY," Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.",172
24673,KRAMER," No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.",172
24674,JERRY, Did he overdose?,172
24675,KRAMER," No, it's just too much.",172
24676,KRUGER," ...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the size of a softball, and that spells trouble.",172
24677,GEORGE," Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?",172
24678,GEORGE,  Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.,172
24679,DR. WEXLER, In your packet you will find the disease you have been assigned and the symptoms you will need to exhibit.,172
24680,MICKEY, Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot!,172
24681,KRAMER, Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?,172
24682,MICKEY," Sorry buddy, this is the ""Hamlet"" of diseases. Severe pain, nausea, delusions, it's got everything.",172
24683,MAN, Sure.,172
24684,KRAMER," Okay, what do you got?",172
24685,MAN, The surgeon left a sponge inside me.,172
24686,KRAMER, Good luck with that.,172
24687,GEORGE, I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.,172
24688,JERRY, What did you do the rest of the day?,172
24689,GEORGE," I saw ""Titanic"". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?",172
24690,JERRY, And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.,172
24691,ELAINE, Hello boys.,172
24692,GEORGE," Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?",172
24693,ELAINE, I did.,172
24694,GEORGE, And the Christian rock?,172
24695,ELAINE," Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!",172
24696,GEORGE," Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?",172
24697,JERRY, No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?,172
24698,ELAINE," Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.",172
24699,GEORGE, I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.,172
24700,JERRY," I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the ""It's me"" on the phone today.",172
24701,ELAINE," ""It's me?"" Isn't it a little premature?",172
24702,JERRY, I thought so.,172
24703,ELAINE," Hah. She's not a ""me"". I'm a ""me"".",172
24704,GEORGE," I'm against all ""it's me""s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!",172
24705,KRAMER," Well, I got gonorrhea.",172
24706,ELAINE, That seems about right.,172
24707,KRAMER, That's what they gave me.,172
24708,GEORGE, They? The Government?,172
24709,JERRY," No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.",172
24710,KRAMER," And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.",172
24711,GEORGE," I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.",172
24712,GEORGE,  Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.,172
24713,ELAINE, What was that?,172
24714,JERRY," Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.",172
24715,KRAMER," See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.",172
24716,JERRY, Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.,172
24717,KRAMER," Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.",172
24718,KRAMER, Just a little burning during urination.,172
24719,KRAMER," The haunting memories of lost love. May I?  Lights?  Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.",172
24720,KRAMER, Gonorrhea!,172
24721,JERRY, One message. Hope it's not from you.,172
24722,ANSWERING MACHINE," ""Hey Jerry, it's me. Call me back.""",172
24723,JERRY, Sophie.,172
24724,GEORGE, She's still doing that?,172
24725,JERRY, Yep.,172
24726,GEORGE," Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the ""it's me"", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.",172
24727,JERRY," I think that's a ""what's good for the goose is good for the gander"".",172
24728,GEORGE," What the hell is a gander, anyway?",172
24729,JERRY,"  It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.",172
24730,SOPHIE, Hey Raef.,172
24731,JERRY,  She thinks it's someone named Raef.,172
24732,GEORGE," Good, let her think it.",172
24733,JERRY,"  So, what's going on?",172
24734,SOPHIE, Not a lot.,172
24735,GEORGE," Ask about you, ask about you.",172
24736,JERRY," So, uh, how are things with Jerry?",172
24737,SOPHIE," Oh, I really like him but, well, I still haven't told him the tractor story.",172
24738,JERRY," Right, right, the tractor story.",172
24739,SOPHIE," Are you sick, Raef? You sound kinda funny.",172
24740,JERRY, I sound funny?,172
24741,GEORGE, Abort! Abort!,172
24742,JERRY," Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye.  That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?",172
24743,GEORGE, That was very real.,172
24744,JERRY, She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.,172
24745,GEORGE," Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?",172
24746,JERRY," Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?",172
24747,ELAINE, So where do you wanna eat?,172
24748,PUDDY, Feels like an Arby's night.,172
24749,ELAINE, Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?,172
24750,PUDDY, Yes.,172
24751,ELAINE," Oh. So, you're pretty religious?",172
24752,PUDDY, That's right.,172
24753,ELAINE, So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?,172
24754,PUDDY, Not for me.,172
24755,ELAINE, Why not?,172
24756,PUDDY, I'm not the one going to hell.,172
24757,GEORGE, You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.,172
24758,JERRY," No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.",172
24759,GEORGE, Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?,172
24760,JERRY," No, she looks completely normal.",172
24761,GEORGE," Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.",172
24762,JERRY, You think she's got toes for thumbs?,172
24763,GEORGE," How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?",172
24764,JERRY, I don't know.,172
24765,GEORGE, Hands a little smelly?,172
24766,JERRY, Why do I seek your counsel?,172
24767,ELAINE, Well I'm going to hell.,172
24768,JERRY, That seems about right.,172
24769,ELAINE, According to Puddy.,172
24770,JERRY," Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--",172
24771,ELAINE, I'm not in the mood.,172
24772,GEORGE,  I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.,172
24773,JERRY, What do you care? You don't believe in hell.,172
24774,ELAINE," I know, but he does.",172
24775,JERRY, So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.,172
24776,ELAINE," Well, relationships are very important to me.",172
24777,JERRY, Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.,172
24778,GEORGE,  And a slice of devil's food cake.,172
24779,GEORGE, Hey. Where is everyone?,172
24780,KRUGER," They're all off the project. They were boring. George, you are my main man.",172
24781,GEORGE, I am?,172
24782,KRUGER," I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but lately you have just seemed 'on'. And you always leave me wanting more.",172
24783,GEORGE, This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.,172
24784,KRUGER," Ah, I'm not too worried about it. Let's get started.",172
24785,GEORGE, Okay.,172
24786,KRUGER," George? Check it out.  Three times around, no feet.",172
24787,GEORGE, And?,172
24788,KRUGER, All me.,172
24789,DR. WEXLER," Alright, and here are you ailments for this week. By the way, Mr. Kramer, you were excellent.",172
24790,KRAMER," Oh, thank you.",172
24791,MICKEY, Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up! What did you get?,172
24792,KRAMER," Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.",172
24793,DR. WEXLER," Oh, it's no mistake. We loved what you did with it.",172
24794,KRAMER," I don't believe this, I'm being typecast.",172
24795,SOPHIE, I move my knight... here. Check.,172
24796,JERRY," They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.",172
24797,SOPHIE," Jerry, are you embarrassed that you're losing?",172
24798,JERRY," Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.",172
24799,SOPHIE, Bought the farm?,172
24800,JERRY, Tractor!,172
24801,SOPHIE," This is an odd side of you, Jerry. I feel uncomfortable.",172
24802,JERRY," Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.",172
24803,GEORGE, A scar?,172
24804,JERRY, A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?,172
24805,GEORGE, A tractor.,172
24806,JERRY, I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.,172
24807,GEORGE, I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.,172
24808,JERRY, She doesn't have toe thumbs.,172
24809,GEORGE," Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--",172
24810,JERRY, Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?,172
24811,GEORGE," Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work.  Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry.  Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?",172
24812,KRUGER, I'm not too worried about it.,172
24813,GEORGE, Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?,172
24814,KRUGER," Alright, alright I'm going.",172
24815,GEORGE,  Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?,172
24816,JERRY, Never.,172
24817,PUDDY," Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one.",172
24818,ELAINE," 'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.",172
24819,PUDDY," C'mon, get it.",172
24820,ELAINE," Well if you want it, you get it.",172
24821,PUDDY," Sorry, thou shalt not steal.",172
24822,ELAINE," Oh, but it's ok for me?",172
24823,PUDDY," What do you care, you know where you're going.",172
24824,ELAINE," Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.",172
24825,PUDDY, Nah.,172
24826,ELAINE, C'mon.,172
24827,PUDDY," Alright, what did I do?",172
24828,ELAINE," David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?",172
24829,PUDDY, Gonna be rough.,172
24830,ELAINE," Uh, you should be trying to save me!",172
24831,PUDDY, Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.,172
24832,ELAINE," I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.",172
24833,PUDDY," You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?",172
24834,ELAINE," Yeah, that's right!",172
24835,MICKEY," Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for love in a bottle?",172
24836,DR. WEXLER, Mr. Kramer? You're up.,172
24837,MICKEY," Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?",172
24838,KRAMER," Well, we'll see.",172
24839,KRAMER,"  Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.",172
24840,MICKEY, Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis!  You wanna be sick? I'll make you sick.,172
24841,FATHER CURTIS, Let me see if I understand this. You're concerned that he isn't concerned that you're going to hell. And you feel that she's too bossy.,172
24842,FATHER CURTIS," Well, oftentimes in cases of inter-faith marriages, couples have difficulty--",172
24843,FATHER CURTIS, You aren't?,172
24844,PUDDY, No.,172
24845,ELAINE," We're just, you know, having a good time.",172
24846,FATHER CURTIS," Oh, well then it's simple. You're both going to hell.",172
24847,PUDDY," No way, this is bogus, man!",172
24848,ELAINE," Well, thank you father.",172
24849,FATHER CURTIS," Oh, did you hear the one about the new guy in hell who's talkng to the devil by the coffee machine?",172
24850,PUDDY," I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.",172
24851,ELAINE," Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.",172
24852,SOPHIE," You know, Jerry, there's this thing that I haven't told you about. See, there was this tractor and, oh boy, this is really difficult.",172
24853,JERRY," Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.",172
24854,SOPHIE, How could you know?,172
24855,JERRY,  Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.,172
24856,KRAMER," ...I didn't say that, no.",172
24857,MICKEY," You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!",172
24858,KRAMER," Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.",172
24859,JERRY," Hey, hey! I'm with someone.",172
24860,KRAMER, Oh. Hello.,172
24861,SOPHIE," No, I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The important thing is that you have a partner who's supportive.",172
24862,KRAMER,  You know? She's right.,172
24863,SOPHIE," Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a tractor.",172
24864,JERRY, You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??,172
24865,KRAMER, You can't get it from that.,172
24866,SOPHIE, But I did. My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea from riding the tractor in my bathing suit.,172
24867,JERRY,"  Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.",172
24868,GEORGE, Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?,172
24869,KRUGER, You seem like you've got a pretty good handle on it.,172
24870,GEORGE," No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!",172
24871,KRUGER," K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, huh? K-uger! K-uger!",172
24872,GEORGE," Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!",172
24873,KRUGER,"  Thank you George, you've been great. That's it for me.",172
24874,GEORGE," Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!",172
24875,KRUGER, It's K-uger!,172
24876,GEORGE, No! No!,172
24877,KRUGER, Goodnight everybody!,172
24878,GEORGE, I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.,173
24879,JERRY," First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.",173
24880,KRAMER," Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..",173
24881,JERRY,  You better hurry.,173
24882,GEORGE, I'm gonna hit the head.,173
24883,KRAMER," Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.",173
24884,JERRY,  Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.,173
24885,KRAMER," Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.",173
24886,JERRY, She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?,173
24887,KRAMER,"  No, that wasn't dancing.",173
24888,JERRY,"  Hey, there's Leo.",173
24889,KRAMER, Oh? Who's Leo?,173
24890,JERRY, Uncle Leo.,173
24891,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..",173

24893,KRAMER,"  Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?",173
24894,WALTER,"  So, Elaine.. are you going to dance this year?",173
24895,ELAINE, Maybe.. All over your face!,173
24896,WAITER," If you do dance, the cooks want to know - so they can be brought out of the kitchen. They missed it last year.",173
24897,PETERMAN," My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said,  All right! Who's dancing?  No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started. ",173
24898,ZACH," Hi, I'm Zach.",173
24899,ELAINE," Hi, I'm miserable. ",173
24900,MANAGER," Excuse me, Sir. What are you doing?",173

24902,MANAGER,  Did you take that book with you into the bathroom?,173
24903,GEORGE,  What do you want to hear?,173
24904,GEORGE," They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me.  How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.",173
24905,JERRY,  Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.,173
24906,GEORGE," They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!",173
24907,JERRY,  'French Impressionist Paintings'?,173
24908,GEORGE, I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-,173
24909,JERRY,  Thank you very much.,173
24910,GEORGE," Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?",173
24911,JERRY, I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.,173
24912,GEORGE,"  Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!",173
24913,JERRY, Sleeping in the caragain?,173
24914,ELAINE, Cocktail flu.,173
24915,JERRY,"  Oh, right. The big party..",173
24916,GEORGE," You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?",173
24917,ELAINE,"  No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..",173
24918,GEORGE, You went home with him?,173
24919,ELAINE, Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!,173
24920,JERRY,"  Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?",173
24921,ELAINE,  Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?,173
24922,JERRY,  What's your position?,173
24923,ELAINE, I am an associate.,173
24924,GEORGE," Hey, me too.",173
24925,WAITRESS," Yeah, me too.",173
24926,ELAINE, Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.,173
24927,GEORGE," Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.",173
24928,ELAINE,"  Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.",173
24929,JERRY,  As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.,173
24930,ELAINE,"  Oh, bravo.",173
24931,JERRY,"  Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?",173
24932,KRAMER,"  No, we've already eaten.",173
24933,NEWMAN,  But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.,173
24934,KRAMER," Jerry, check this out.  Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!",173
24935,JERRY,"  No, you're not.",173
24936,KRAMER," Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..",173
24937,JERRY,"  No, he doesn't.",173
24938,NEWMAN, He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!,173

24940,KRAMER," We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!",173
24941,NEWMAN, It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.,173
24942,JERRY," So, who's gonna pull this thing?",173
24943,KRAMER,"  Well, I just assumed you would.",173
24944,NEWMAN," Yeah, but I though-",173
24945,KRAMER,  Da-da-da-da no.,173
24946,JERRY,"  My, isn't this an awkward moment?",173
24947,KRAMER,  What about the homeless?,173
24948,NEWMAN, Can't we worry about them later?,173
24949,KRAMER,  To pull the rickshaw.,173
24950,NEWMAN,  They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..,173
24951,KRAMER, They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!,173
24952,JERRY,"  Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.",173
24953,LEO," Jerry, hello! ",173
24954,JERRY," So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay?",173
24955,LEO, I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.,173
24956,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?",173
24957,LEO," What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money!  But I'm not.",173
24958,JERRY,"  Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.",173
24959,LEO, Why didn't ya say hello?,173
24960,JERRY, Because you were too busy stealing a book.,173
24961,LEO,  You still say hello.,173
24962,JERRY,"  Leo, I saw you steal.",173
24963,LEO," Oh, they don't care. We all do it.",173
24964,JERRY," Who, criminals?",173
24965,LEO, Senior citizens. No big deal.,173
24966,JERRY, You could get arrested.,173
24967,LEO, Arrested? Come on!  I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me home?,173
24968,JERRY,  Leo..,173
24969,LEO," Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point.",173
24970,JERRY,  Thank you.,173
24971,LEO,  Will somebody answer that damn phone?!,173
24972,ELAINE,"  Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?",173
24973,WALTER, Well..,173
24974,ELAINE," ""Well""? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.",173
24975,ELAINE,  Oh man. Ugh..,173

24977,ELAINE, Yeah.,173
24978,WALTER, Aren't you upset?,173
24979,ELAINE,"  Yes. Oh, man! Oh!",173
24980,KRAMER," Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws.  Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.",173
24981,HOMELESS MAN, The government!,173
24982,KRAMER,  Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.,173
24983,NEWMAN," Alright, who's first?",173
24984,KRMAER, Hey.,173
24985,NEWMAN," Name, please.",173

24989,NEWMAN,"  Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go!",173
24990,KRAMER,  Giddy up! Good form.,173
24991,NEWMAN,"  Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.",173

24997,GEORGE, Why not?,173
24998,CASHIER, It's been flagged.,173
24999,GEORGE,  Flagged?,173
25000,CASHIER, It's been in the bathroom.,173
25001,GEORGE, It says that on the computer?,173
25002,CASHIER, Please take it home. We don't want it near the other books.,173
25003,GEORGE,"  Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!",173
25004,JERRY,"  I don't believe this!  Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..",173
25005,GUARD, Mm-hmm. Where's your uncle?,173
25006,JERRY,"  He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..",173
25007,GAURD,  We have a 51-50 in paperbacks. All units respond.,173
25008,JERRY," '51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?",173
25009,GUARD," Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to stand out of the way and let us handle this.  Swarm! Swarm!",173
25010,LEO, What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused!,173
25011,GUARD, You're under arrest.,173
25012,JERRY,  I just wanted you to scare him.,173
25013,LEO," Jerry, you ratted me out?!",173
25014,JERRY,  Hello?,173
25015,LEO, Hello.,173
25016,JERRY," Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.",173
25017,HELEN," Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.",173
25018,JERRY,  Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.,173
25019,MORTY, She's got priors.,173
25020,JERRY,  Prior convictions? Leo?,173
25021,HELEN, It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.,173
25022,MORTY," Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.",173
25023,JERRY,  What does that mean?,173
25024,HELEN, Nobody pays for everyting.,173
25025,JERRY,  You're stealing too?!,173
25026,MORTY," Nothing. Batteries.  Well, they wear out so quick.",173
25027,JERRY," Mom, you too?",173
25028,HELEN," Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.",173
25029,JERRY," Alright, I'll talk to you later.",173
25030,KRAMER,"  Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he , he bolted.",173
25031,JERRY,"  Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.",173
25032,KRAMER,"  See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.",173
25033,NEWMAN," We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.",173
25034,JERRY, To the Idiotmobile!,173
25035,JERRY," So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?",173
25036,ELAINE," That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-",173
25037,JERRY,  Tina Turner?,173
25038,ELAINE,  Alright.,173
25039,GEORGE," Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!",173
25040,JERRY, Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?,173
25041,GEORGE, I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.,173
25042,JERRY,  Not underpants.,173
25043,ELAINE," Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.",173
25044,JERRY,  Uncle Leo. Hello!,173

25048,JERRY,"  Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!",173
25049,ELAINE," French impressionism. Oh, I love this.  Now, what is the problem with this book?",173
25050,GEORGE, Nothing.,173
25051,ELAINE, How much do you want for it?,173
25052,GEORGE," You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.",173
25053,JERRY, Leo's furious.  What is that doing on the table?,173
25054,GEORGE,"  Jerry, simmer down.",173
25055,JERRY,  I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.,173
25056,ELAINE,  What is wrong with this book?,173
25057,GEORGE, Simmer!,173

25059,ELAINE,  Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! ,173
25060,GEORGE,"  May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?",173
25061,JERRY, I don't read in the bathroom.,173
25062,GEORGE," Well, aren't you something?",173
25063,PETERMAN," Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover.",173
25064,ELAINE,  Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.,173
25065,PETERMAN," Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton?",173
25066,ELAINE,  Love newton?,173
25067,PETERMAN," I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.",173
25068,ELAINE," An addict?  Well, it just keeps getting better!",173
25069,PETERMAN," And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel.",173
25070,ELAINE," Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!",173
25071,PETERMAN," Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey.  And you will be at his side.",173
25072,ELAINE," Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-",173

25105,NEWMAN, Uh..,173
25106,KRAMER, What?,173
25107,NEWMAN," You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.",173
25108,KRAMER," Yes, that's true.",173
25109,NEWMAN," So, which one of us is gonna pull?",173

25121,GEORGE,  Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.,173
25122,REBECCA," It's been flagged. I know. I used to work in a Brentano's. Mister, we're trying to help the homeless heare - it's bad enough that we have some nut out there trying to strap 'em to a rickshaw!",173

25148,GEORGE," So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.",173
25149,JERRY,"  You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?",173
25150,GEORGE, I'm goin' in!,173
25151,MANAGER, Did you want to speak with the manager?,173

25153,MANAGER," Yes, Uncle Leo. I remember him. I'm sorry, our policy is we prosecute all shoplifters.",173
25154,JERRY,"  Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.",173
25155,MANAGER," That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone.",173
25156,JERRY, So it could be anyone?,173
25157,MANAGER, I.. guess. As long as we catch him in the act.,173

25172,JERRY, What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?,174
25173,ELAINE," It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?",174
25174,JERRY, Why aren't you there now?,174
25175,ELAINE," I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.",174
25176,JERRY," You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.",174
25177,ELAINE," Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..",174
25178,JERRY," Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?",174
25179,ELAINE, Your old high school hangout? Why?,174
25180,JERRY, They're closing. We're going for one last slice.,174
25181,KRAMER," Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.",174
25182,KRAMER," Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.",174
25183,JERRY, Where did you get this?,174
25184,KRAMER," Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.",174
25185,JERRY, You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?,174
25186,KRAMER, They want to know why they never see you.,174
25187,KRAMER, I'm gonna eat that later.,174
25188,JERRY, So they just gave you this?,174
25189,KRAMER," Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.",174
25190,ELAINE," Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?",174
25191,KRAMER," Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.",174
25192,JERRY, How come I haven't read about this?,174
25193,KRAMER," Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.",174
25194,ELAINE, Really? What're the other titles?,174
25195,KRAMER," Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad.",174
25196,JERRY, Son of dad?,174
25197,KRAMER, Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.,174
25198,GEORGE, Mario's Pizza.,174
25199,GEORGE," Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?",174
25200,MARIO, No.,174
25201,JERRY, We used to come in every day.,174
25202,MARIO, So where ya been? We're tanking here.,174
25203,GEORGE, We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.,174
25204,MARIO," Oh, thanks. That'll save us.",174
25205,JERRY," All right, make it the large sodas.",174
25206,GEORGE," Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.",174
25207,JERRY," Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.",174
25208,GEORGE, Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!,174
25209,BOY, Thanks a lot.,174
25210,GEORGE," Ah, beat it, punk.",174
25211,JERRY," Hey, look at the high score--""G.L.C."" George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?",174
25212,GEORGE," Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.",174
25213,JERRY, I remember that night.,174
25214,GEORGE, The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...,174
25215,MARIO, Here's your pizza pea brains.,174
25216,JERRY, I think I remember why we stopped coming here.,174
25217,GEORGE, Yeah.,174
25218,ELAINE , This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?,174
25219,ELAINE, What is this?,174
25220,MALE WORKER," You were out sick yesterday, so we got you a get-well cake.",174
25221,FEMALE WORKER, It's carrot. It's good for you.,174
25222,WORKERS ," Get well get well soon, we wish you to get--",174
25223,ELAINE," Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?",174
25224,MALE WORKER, I think it's nice.,174
25225,ELAINE," What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!",174
25226,WORKER ," Get well, get well soon--",174
25227,MALE WORKER, It's not happening.,174
25228,BECKY, Can we still it eat?,174
25229,JERRY," I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--",174
25230,LISI, End under water?,174
25231,JERRY," Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--",174
25232,LISI, So much more violent.,174
25233,JERRY, Not as long.,174
25234,LISI," Well, I should probably--",174
25235,JERRY, Get going.,174
25236,LISI, Yeah.,174
25237,JERRY," Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--",174
25238,LISI, Eight tomorrow?,174
25239,JERRY," Actually, that's--",174
25240,LISI, What you were thinking.,174
25241,JERRY, Right.,174
25242,GEORGE," Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--",174
25243,JERRY, Sure.  How about this one?,174
25244,GEORGE," Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.",174
25245,JERRY," Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.",174
25246,GEORGE," So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?",174
25247,JERRY," Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?",174
25248,GEORGE, What?,174
25249,JERRY," Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.",174
25250,GEORGE, You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!,174
25251,KRAMER," Well, more bad news Jerry.",174
25252,KRAMER," You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.",174
25253,JERRY," Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.",174
25254,KRAMER, Not as many as there used to be.,174
25255,GEORGE," No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?",174
25256,KRAMER," You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.",174
25257,JERRY, Another friend?,174
25258,KRAMER," Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.",174
25259,GEORGE," Well, is he good, Kramer?",174
25260,KRAMER," Oh, he's the best...and the worst.",174
25261,GEORGE," Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.",174
25262,KRAMER," Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.",174
25263,GEORGE, Slippery Pete?,174
25264,KRAMER," Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.",174
25265,GEORGE," All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!",174
25266,JERRY, Come on.,174
25267,KRAMER, Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt.,174
25268,JERRY, Hello?,174
25269,ELAINE, So how's it going with my friend?,174
25270,JERRY, She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.,174
25271,JERRY, What is that?,174
25272,ELAINE," Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 4",174
25273,JERRY, So join in.,174
25274,ELAINE, I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.,174
25275,JERRY, All right.,174
25276,JERRY," Hey, wh-what--",174
25277,KRAMER, Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful.,174
25278,ELAINE, Anybody here? Peterboy?,174
25279,ELAINE," Ooh, it's a cake walk.",174
25280,PETERMAN ," Get well, get well soon we wish you to get well.",174
25281,PETERMAN," Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.",174
25282,ELAINE," Mr. Peterman, um--",174
25283,PETERMAN," We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?",174
25284,ELAINE," No, sir, I can't.",174
25285,PETERMAN," Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000.",174
25286,JERRY," Well Lisi, that was another-",174
25287,LISI, Lovely evening.,174
25288,JERRY, Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--,174
25289,LISI, Go for a hansom cab ride?,174
25290,JERRY, Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?,174
25291,LISI," 84th street, right off Riverside Park.",174
25292,JERRY, Riverside Park.,174
25293,LISI, I thought we were going--,174
25294,JERRY, Back to my place. That's right.,174
25295,GEORGE, So you slept with her?,174
25296,JERRY," She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.",174
25297,GEORGE, And you automatically sleep with her?,174
25298,JERRY," Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--",174
25299,GEORGE, Finished your thought.,174
25300,ELAINE, Guess what I ate.,174
25301,GEORGE, An ostrich burger.,174
25302,ELAINE," No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.",174
25303,JERRY, How'd it taste?,174
25304,ELAINE, A little stale.,174
25305,JERRY, Yeah.,174
25306,GEORGE ," So, uh are you sleeping with Peterman?",174
25307,ELAINE ," No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.",174
25308,GEORGE," You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.",174
25309,ELAINE," Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.",174
25310,JERRY," Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.",174
25311,ELAINE, What is going on with you two?,174
25312,JERRY," Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.",174
25313,GEORGE, What's that?,174
25314,ELAINE, 4,174
25315,JERRY," Well, I'm calling this off right now.",174
25316,ELAINE," No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.",174
25317,JERRY," Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.",174
25318,ELAINE, Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.,174
25319,ELAINE, Just a little off the side...,174
25320,ELAINE," Well, no point in wasting $1,200.",174
25321,ELAINE ," Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?",174
25322,GEORGE," Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.",174
25323,GEORGE," Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.",174
25324,SHLOMO, I don't know If I'm the best.,174
25325,GEORGE, Oh...you're very good.,174
25326,SHLOMO," Let's say ""good.""",174
25327,GEORGE," Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.",174
25328,KRAMER, Lock and load.,174
25329,SLIPPERY PETE," You think you can handle that, numb nuts?",174
25330,KRAMER," All right, all right, come on, now.",174
25331,SLIPPERY PETE, That was my mail-order bride.,174
25332,KRAMER," Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.",174
25333,SLIPPERY PETE, It doesn't give you the right to make out with her.,174
25334,KRAMER, You weren't even married yet.,174
25335,GEORGE," All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.",174
25336,GEORGE," Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.",174
25337,SHLOMO, So what kind of jail time are we looking at if we're caught?,174
25338,GEORGE, What do you mean?,174
25339,SLIPPERY PETE," We're stealing this thing, right?",174
25340,GEORGE, No. I--I paid for it.,174
25341,SLIPPERY PETE, I thought we were stealing it.,174
25342,KRAMER, Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.,174
25343,GEORGE, We're not stealing it.,174
25344,SHLOMO, I definitely thought we're stealing it.,174
25345,GEORGE," All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?",174
25346,SLIPPERY PETE," Well, I need a battery for this kind of a job. Can I at least steal a battery?",174

25446,ELAINE," Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?",174
25447,PETERMAN," Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham.",174
25448,ELAINE, Ohh...,174
25449,PETERMAN, Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this.,174
25450,EALINE," Mr. Peterman, I, uh...",174
25451,PETERMAN," Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you?",174

25456,JERRY , Cup of tea with lemon.,175
25457,GEORGE, What happened to your voice?,175

25459,GEORGE," Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.",175
25460,JERRY, Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?,175
25461,GEORGE," The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.",175
25462,JERRY, You mean like...Liza!,175
25463,GEORGE, But I was thinking...T-bone.,175
25464,JERRY," But there's no ""t"" in your name. What about G-bone?",175
25465,GEORGE, There's no G-bone.,175
25466,JERRY, There's a g-spot.,175
25467,GEORGE, That's a myth.,175
25468,JERRY," T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya.",175

25477,JERRY, I hired her from a service!,175
25478,MAID, All done.,175
25479,JERRY, Thank you. Nice job.,175
25480,MAID, Is this mine?,175
25481,JERRY, Yeah.,175
25482,JERRY, What?,175
25483,ELAINE," Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?",175
25484,JERRY, Notice what? She's not really even a maid.,175
25485,ELAINE, Oh.,175
25486,JERRY," She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.",175
25487,ELAINE, Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.,175
25488,KRAMER," Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.",175

25494,KRAMER, Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.,175
25495,JERRY, It's like 10 minutes by subway.,175
25496,KRAMER, I don't know.,175
25497,KRAMER," Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.",175
25498,ELAINE, What? What is that?,175
25499,JERRY," That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.",175
25500,ELAINE, I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.,175
25501,KRAMER," Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.",175
25502,ELAINE, At work?,175
25503,KRAMER, No. At your apartment.,175
25504,ELAINE, I don't have a fax machine.,175

25535,CINDY," Hi, Elaine.",175
25536,ELAINE, All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.,175
25537,JERRY," Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?",175
25538,ELAINE, You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.,175
25539,JERRY, No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--,175
25540,ELAINE, What? A health plan?,175
25541,JERRY," I was going to say, ""Being a good host.""",175
25542,ELAINE, Oh-ho-ho. Oh.,175
25543,JERRY," But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.",175
25544,ELAINE, So you consider this a relationship?,175
25545,JERRY," Yes, I do.",175
25546,ELAINE, Oh. Have you been out?,175

25553,JERRY, And gum.,175
25554,ELAINE," Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.",175
25555,JERRY, She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!,175
25556,KRAMER," Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.",175
25557,ELAINE," Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?",175
25558,KRAMER," Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.",175

25567,ELAINE, Ahem. 646? What is this?,175
25568,PHONE MAN, That's your new area code.,175
25569,ELAINE, I thought 646 was just for new numbers.,175
25570,PHONE MAN, This is a new number.,175
25571,ELAINE," No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.",175
25572,PHONE MAN," Look, I work for the phone company. I've had a lot of experience with semantics, so don't try to lure me into some maze of circular logic.",175
25573,ELAINE," You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.",175
25574,PHONE MAN," I could've killed you, and no one would've known.",175
25575,JERRY," Kramer, you're still on the phone?",175

25585,KRAMER," Well, why no T-bone?!",175
25586,JERRY, Why no T-bone?,175

25597,ELAINE," No, I'm not. Here you go.",175
25598,MAN, 646?,175
25599,ELAINE, It's a new area code.,175
25600,MAN, What area? New Jersey?,175
25601,ELAINE," No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.",175
25602,MAN, Do I have to dial a one first?,175
25603,MAN, I'm really kinda seein' somebody.,175
25604,ELAINE," Yeah? Well, so am I!",175

25608,WATKINS, Heh heh. You're not a T-bone. You're a perfect George.,175
25609,GEORGE," What? Now, you listen to me!",175
25610,KRUGER," Hey, look at George. He's givin' it to T-bone. He's jumpin' up and down like some kind of monkey. Hey, what was the name of that monkey that could read sign language?",175
25611,WATKINS," All right, you can have T-bone. Stop crying.",175
25612,GEORGE , I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.,175

25632,KRAMER, Oh.,175
25633,CINDY," Hi, Kramer.",175
25634,CINDY," Thanks, Jerry. Bye.",175
25635,KRAMER," Well, what's the matter?",175
25636,JERRY, What did I just pay for?,175
25637,KRAMER, Uh-oh. You're a john.,175
25638,JERRY, Koko?,175
25639,GEORGE, Koko.,175
25640,JERRY," Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.",175
25641,GEORGE," Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?",175
25642,JERRY," Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.",175
25643,GEORGE," Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--",175
25644,JERRY," No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.",175
25645,GEORGE, How much you pay this maid?,175
25646,JERRY, 40.,175
25647,GEORGE," 40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.",175
25648,JERRY, I don't know what this is.,175
25649,KRAMER," Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.",175
25650,JERRY, Ooh.,175
25651,KRAMER," Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.",175
25652,GEORGE, I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.,175
25653,KRAMER," Well, now I can't see Jerry.",175
25654,JERRY, I look about the same.,175
25655,GEORGE, What?,175
25656,JERRY, I was talking to him.,175
25657,KRAMER, What?,175
25658,JERRY, Never mind.,175
25659,KRAMER, Come on. What'd he say?,175
25660,GEORGE, Never mind.,175
25661,KRAMER," Jerry, come on. What'd you say?",175
25662,JERRY, What?,175
25663,KRAMER, Come on. Where'd you go?,175
25664,JERRY, Go back.,175
25665,KRAMER, Eh! Come on. What did you say?,175
25666,JERRY," I said, never mind.",175
25667,KRAMER," Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh.",175
25668,JERRY, I hate the counter.,175
25669,ELAINE, Hey.,175
25670,JERRY, Hey.,175
25671,ELAINE, I hate the counter.,175
25672,KRAMER, Who's that?,175
25673,ELAINE ," Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz.",175
25674,JERRY," Oh, she didn't mind?",175
25675,ELAINE, No. She died.,175
25676,JERRY," Hey, that's great.",175
25677,GEORGE, What happened to Mrs. Krantz?,175
25678,JERRY, Elaine got a new number because she died.,175
25679,KRAMER, Newman died?,175
25680,ELAINE, What did he say?,175
25681,JERRY, Some new kind of pie.,175
25682,GEORGE, I'll try a piece.,175
25683,KRAMER," All right, who's down there?",175
25684,JERRY," Hey, there's a booth.",175
25685,KRAMER," Hey, Elaine.",175
25686,ELAINE," Oh, hi.",175
25687,KRAMER, Did you hear about Newman?,175
25688,ELAINE, What?,175
25689,GEORGE, Hey.,175
25690,JERRY, So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?,175
25691,GEORGE," Oh, yeah.",175
25692,JERRY, Double zero?,175
25693,GEORGE," It's ""ooh"" As in ""ooh ooh ah ah.""",175
25694,CINDY, Your nickname's Koko? One of the girls down at the maid service is named Coco.,175
25695,GEORGE, Really? Coco?,175
25696,CINDY, Yeah. Coco. That girl's all right.,175
25697,GEORGE," You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.",175
25698,JERRY, Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.,175
25699,GEORGE, Say good-bye to Koko.,175
25700,JERRY," Good-bye, Koko.",175
25701,KRAMER," Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.",175
25702,JERRY," Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.",175
25703,KRAMER," Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!",175
25704,CINDY, What was that?,175
25705,JERRY, I didn't hear anything.,175
25706,CINDY," All right, I'm takin' off. Aren't you forgetting something?",175
25707,JERRY," Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.",175
25708,CINDY, No. My money.,175
25709,JERRY, For what?,175
25710,CINDY, For my maid services. You booked me for today.,175
25711,JERRY, But you didn't really do any work.,175
25712,CINDY, I made the bed.,175
25713,JERRY, But you took a nap in it.,175
25714,CINDY, So?,175
25715,JERRY, I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.,175
25716,CINDY, No. That was the maid.,175
25717,JERRY," Well, who took the nap?",175
25718,CINDY, The girlfriend.,175
25719,JERRY, $40 seems kind of steep for a nap.,175
25720,CINDY," So, what are you saying? That I'm a bad maid or some kind of a prostitute?",175
25721,JERRY," Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.",175
25722,CINDY," You know, I don't think I want to be your girlfriend or your maid.",175
25723,JERRY, So is this a breakup/quitting?,175
25724,CINDY, Yeah. Don't ever call me or hire me again.,175
25725,JERRY," Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!",175
25726,PHONE MAN, Sign here.,175
25727,ELAINE, Yes! 212.,175
25728,ELAINE," Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?",175
25729,PHONE MAN," Oh, you know, it's an odd thing. He went out on a job and never came back. Nobody knows what happened.",175
25730,ELAINE, All right! I am back in the game.,175
25731,ELAINE, Hello?,175
25732,BOY, Gammy!,175
25733,ELAINE," No. You got the wrong number, kid.",175
25734,BOY," Gammy Krantz, it's your grandson Bobby. Why haven't you called?",175
25735,ELAINE, Oh...nuts.,175
25736,BOY, Do you hate me 'cause of my lazy eye?,175
25737,ELAINE, No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.,175
25738,JERRY, So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?,175
25739,ELAINE, Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?,175
25740,JERRY, Miss.,175
25741,ELAINE, He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.,175
25742,JERRY, I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?,175
25743,ELAINE, Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine.,175
25744,JERRY, Elaine...,175
25745,JERRY, Hello?,175
25746,COMPUTER VOICE, You have a collect call from--,175
25747,KRAMER," Hey, buddy, don't say no!",175
25748,JERRY, I accept.,175
25749,KRAMER," I went down to Madeline's. I told her, ""You gotta move, or it's over.""",175
25750,JERRY," Well, what happened?",175
25751,KRAMER," I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.",175
25752,JERRY, What's around you?,175
25753,KRAMER, I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?,175
25754,JERRY, Is it Famous Ray's?,175
25755,KRAMER, No. It's Original Ray's.,175
25756,JERRY, Famous Original Ray's?,175
25757,KRAMER," It's just Original, Jerry!",175
25758,JERRY," Well, what street are you on?",175
25759,KRAMER," Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.",175
25760,JERRY," Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!",175
25761,KRAMER, Aah!,175
25762,MAN, You Steinfeld?,175
25763,JERRY, Yeah.,175
25764,MAN, My name is Maxwell. I'm from Maid To Order. It's a pun. I sent one of my girls over to your place.,175
25765,JERRY, Cindy.,175
25766,MAN, She says she had a little problem with you. You didn't pay.,175
25767,JERRY," You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.",175
25768,MAN," Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter--",175
25769,JERRY," Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.",175
25770,MAN, You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?,175
25771,JERRY, What?,175
25772,MAN," Well, it kinda depends on the situation, but if I don't get my money from you, I'm gonna get it from her.",175
25773,JERRY, I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.,175
25774,MAN," Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! Give it to the girl. I'm an independent contractor. Tax purposes.",175
25775,ELAINE," Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy?  All right, here we go.  Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.",175
25776,BOBBY, 9-1-1.,175
25777,JERRY," Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy.",175
25778,CINDY, What do you want?,175
25779,JERRY, Here. I got your money.,175
25780,CINDY, I don't want any money from you.,175
25781,JERRY, Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.,175
25782,POLICE," Looking for a good time, sir? You wanna step out of the car, sickie?",175
25783,JERRY," Well, this is all very sophisticated.",175
25784,FIREMAN," All right, hang on, Gammy! You're gonna make it!",175
25785,ELAINE, Aah!,175
25786,MAXWELL," Hey, you look a little lost. You from around here?",175
25787,KRAMER," Uh, no.",175
25788,MAXWELL, You know where you're going?,175
25789,KRAMER," Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is.",175
25790,MAXWELL, Doesn't sound like much of a friend. You got any money?,175
25791,KRAMER," Uh, no.",175
25792,MAXWELL, You wanna make some?,175
25793,KRAMER, Ok.,175
25794,MAXWELL, Do you know how to use a mop wringer?,175
25795,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah.",175
25796,MAXWELL, Why don't you get in the car?,175
25797,KRAMER, Hi. Ahh...these are soft seats.,175
25798,KRUGER," Hey, Koko, Who's this?",175
25799,GEORGE," This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.",175
25800,KRUGER," So you're just hiring new people now? That's your job, to hire people?",175
25801,GEORGE, Yes?,175
25802,KRUGER," Ok, good enough for me, Koko.",175
25803,KRUGER," Ahem. Now, what's your name?",175
25804,COCO, My name is Coco. Coco Higgins.,175
25805,GEORGE, Coco?,175
25806,KRUGER, We can't have 2 Cocos. So I guess you're back to being George.,175
25807,GEORGE," Well, it was a hell of a ride.",175
25808,KRUGER," All right, the Grace building. There's a big stain on the front. How do we get it off?",175
25809,COCO," When I was a little girl in Jamaica, my Gammy taught me to take a wet rag and in a circ--",175
25810,GEORGE," Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.",175
25811,COCO, What did you say about my Gammy?,175
25812,GEORGE, Forget Gammy.,175
25813,KRUGER, Who's Gammy?,175
25814,GEORGE, There's no Gammy.,175
25815,KRUGER, Maybe there should be a Gammy.,175
25816,GEORGE," Oh, no.",175
25817,KRUGER, George.,175
25818,ALL , Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy!,175
25819,GEORGE, Gammy's gettin' upset!,175
25820,GEORGE," Man, I'm starving.",176
25821,ELAINE, How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?,176
25822,GEORGE, Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.,176
25823,JERRY, Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.,176
25824,KRAMER," You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.",176
25825,JERRY, I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.,176
25826,ELAINE," Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.",176
25827,GEORGE, Those nachos are killing me.,176
25828,ELAINE, I thought you were hungry.,176
25829,GEORGE, It's complicated.,176
25830,KRAMER," Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.",176
25831,JERRY, Keep your shirt on. I got it.,176
25832,ELAINE, Watch out for that maroon Golf.,176
25833,KRAMER," Oh, boy.",176
25834,JERRY, Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.,176
25835,KRAMER," I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...",176
25836,JERRY," Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.",176
25837,KRAMER," You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.",176
25838,ELAINE," Oh, no, I couldn't do that.",176
25839,KRAMER," Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.",176
25840,ELAINE," Oh, all right.",176
25841,KRAMER, Yeah.,176
25842,GEORGE, So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.,176
25843,ELAINE," Oh, yeah. What's that called?",176
25844,GEORGE, Blimp,176
25845,JERRY, How was it?,176
25846,GEORGE, I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?,176
25847,JERRY, Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.,176
25848,GEORGE," Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, ""That's gotta hurt!""",176
25849,JERRY, Heh.,176
25850,GEORGE, The place went nuts.,176
25851,JERRY, Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.,176
25852,GEORGE, Yeah.,176
25853,KRAMER, Why are we slowing down?,176
25854,JERRY, What is that music?,176
25855,GEORGE, What's with all these flags?,176
25856,JERRY," Oh, no.",176
25857,ELAINE, It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!,176
25858,JERRY, It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!,176
25859,ELAINE," Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.",176
25860,KRAMER, All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.,176
25861,KRAMER," Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.",176
25862,PUERTO RICAN MAN," Well, it is our day.",176
25863,KRAMER, Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.,176
25864,RADIO, And the Mets score two in the eighth inning.,176
25865,JERRY," See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.",176
25866,GEORGE, I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.,176
25867,ELAINE," I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.",176
25868,JERRY, I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.,176
25869,KRAMER," All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.",176
25870,JERRY," But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?",176
25871,GEORGE, Just inch over. You worm your way.,176
25872,ELAINE," Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.",176
25873,KRAMER," You know, you should make yourself throw up.",176
25874,ELAINE, Huh?,176
25875,KRAMER, You know you're going to.,176
25876,JERRY," All right, I'm worming.",176
25877,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.",176
25878,JERRY, They're not letting me in.,176
25879,GEORGE, My hand is out.,176
25880,JERRY," Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.",176
25881,ELAINE, You sure you want his face?,176
25882,KRAMER," No, no, no. It was María Conchita Alonso.",176
25883,GEORGE, This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.,176
25884,JERRY, The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.,176
25885,GEORGE, Look at me! I am man! I am you!,176
25886,GEORGE," All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.",176
25887,KRAMER, Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.,176
25888,JERRY, One more lane to go.,176
25889,GEORGE, All right! We're here!,176
25890,LAMAR," Oh, look who's here. My old buddy, black Saab.",176
25891,JERRY, Maroon Golf.,176
25892,LAMAR," Where you goin', black Saab? You seem to be a tad askew.",176
25893,JERRY, Could you move your car back a little?,176
25894,LAMAR, Oh. Sorry. I seem to have cut you off.,176
25895,ELAINE," All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.",176
25896,JERRY, You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.,176
25897,ELAINE, I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.,176
25898,KRAMER," Con dios? Well, that's rude.",176
25899,JERRY, Can you believe her?,176
25900,GEORGE, Yeah. I'll see you later.,176
25901,JERRY, Where are you going?,176
25902,GEORGE, The movies. Blimp is playing right there.,176
25903,JERRY, You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?,176
25904,GEORGE," It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.",176
25905,JERRY, That's not what I do.,176
25906,GEORGE, Isn't it?,176
25907,JERRY," Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.",176
25908,KRAMER," You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.",176
25909,ELAINE, Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?,176
25910,ELAINE , Hey! Fold your dog's ear back!,176
25911,ELAINE, Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.,176
25912,CAB DRIVER," No, you can't.",176
25913,ELAINE," Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here.",176
25914,ELAINE," Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!",176
25915,CAB DRIVER, Where to?,176
25916,ELAINE, That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.,176
25917,ELAINE, Hey. Taxi! Taxi!,176
25918,GEORGE," Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.",176
25919,LASER GUY, Gimme a box of those and one of those.,176
25920,GEORGE," Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?",176
25921,LASER GUY, The laser's not funny. I'm funny.,176
25922,GEORGE," Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.",176
25923,LASER GUY, Uh-huh.,176
25924,GEORGE," It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...",176
25925,JERRY," I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.",176
25926,LAMAR," This traffic's a killer, ain't it?",176
25927,KRAMER," You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.",176
25928,JERRY, Walk away?,176
25929,KRAMER," You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.",176
25930,JERRY, Isn't there a deductible?,176
25931,KRAMER," All right, what is your deductible?",176
25932,JERRY, I don't know.,176
25933,KRAMER," Yes, because they've already deducted it.",176
25934,JERRY, From what?,176
25935,KRAMER," The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.",176
25936,JERRY, We're not leaving the car!,176
25937,KRAMER," All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.",176
25938,JERRY, Absolutely not. He sped up.,176
25939,RADIO," Swung on, line hard toward left center field. That's in the gap, that's a base hit.",176
25940,JERRY, I'm ready to talk.,176
25941,GEORGE, That's gotta hurt!,176
25942,GEORGE, It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!,176
25943,GEORGE," Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!",176
25944,KRAMER," Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an ""I am sorry"" wave.",176
25945,JERRY, What's that?,176
25946,KRAMER," You raise the hand, lower the head-- ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!"" You get my drift.",176
25947,JERRY, Ok!,176
25948,LAMAR, Hallelujah. Praise the lord. But I'll take it.,176
25949,KRAMER," Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.",176
25950,GEORGE," All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.",176
25951,JERRY, What's that on your forehead?,176
25952,GEORGE, It's probably chocolate.,176
25953,JERRY," Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?",176
25954,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!",176
25955,GEORGE," All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!",176
25956,JERRY," See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an ""I'm not sorry"" wave.",176
25957,LAMAR, What was that?,176
25958,JERRY," I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!",176
25959,JERRY, Elaine?!,176
25960,ELAINE, Jerry?!,176
25961,LAMAR, Jackass? So I'm a jackass now?,176
25962,JERRY," So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?",176
25963,PUERTO RICAN MAN," Buenos dias, my friend.",176
25964,JERRY, Not you! The guy in the Amigo.,176
25965,ELAINE," Uh, well, uh, here--here is good.",176
25966,TAXI DRIVER," Oh, yeah, sure, and now I'm gonna be stuck here. But you knew the way to go! You went to college!",176
25967,ELAINE," Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.",176
25968,ELAINE," Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?",176
25969,JERRY," Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!",176
25970,LAMAR, So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. That's real good.,176
25971,ELAINE," I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.",176
25972,JERRY," Elaine, he doesn't need-",176
25973,LAMAR, Used to date? So I guess you found out he's a jackass.,176
25974,JERRY, 'Cause that's what's gonna happen.,176
25975,KRAMER, Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?,176
25976,GEORGE, Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.,176
25977,ELAINE," All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.",176
25978,GEORGE," This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?",176
25979,JERRY, I don't know.,176
25980,GEORGE," I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.",176
25981,KRAMER," You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.",176
25982,JERRY," Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.",176
25983,GEORGE," Oh, my god.",176
25984,JERRY," Hey, there's the soda guy.",176

26008,SALES WOMAN, The asking price is $1.5 million.,176

26051,SALES WOMAN," Mr. Varnsen, if you like the apartment, I should tell you I've also had some interest from a wealthy industrialist.",176
26052,JERRY, Not Pennypacker!,176
26053,SALES WOMAN, You know him?,176
26054,JERRY," I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!",176

26144,JERRY,  KRAMER!,177
26145,JERRY,"JERRY: Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. ""Oh, is he good?"" ""Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best."" They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, ""You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher."" And then there's always that, ""Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me."" Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, ""Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs.""",18
26146,JULIANNA," ...And usually for lunch I'll have a salad, and for dinner, I eat whatever I want.",18
26147,JERRY, What do you think the worst part of being blind is?,18
26148,JULIANNA, Excuse me?,18
26149,JERRY," You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?",18
26150,JULIANNA, I don't know.,18
26151,JERRY, I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.,18
26152,JULIANNA, Well that's how my five-year old eats. He's a very picky eater.,18
26153,JERRY, You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?,18
26154,JULIANNA, No.,18
26155,JERRY," He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.",18
26156,JULIANNA, Oh.,18
26157,JERRY," Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that.  And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.",18
26158,JULIANNA , Have you seen any good movies?,18
26159,JERRY, Who takes care of your boy during the day?,18

26161,JERRY, No no. I'm just saying.,18
26162,JULIANNA, She had references.,18
26163,JERRY," Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.",18
26164,JERRY, You know I think this is really helping.,18
26165,JULIANNA," I don't live near here, ya know!",18
26166,JERRY, So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.,18
26167,ELAINE, I don't like to talk during a massage.,18
26168,JERRY," Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.",18
26169,GEORGE," Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.",18
26170,ELAINE, Oh! I forgot to tell you--,18
26171,JERRY, I'm in the middle of a story.,18
26172,ELAINE," Oh, okay, go ahead.",18

26177,ELAINE," Oh, wasn't that terrible?",18
26178,JERRY," Yes, it was.",18
26179,GEORGE, Not even an apple.,18
26180,ELAINE," She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.",18
26181,JERRY, I know it was stupid.,18
26182,ELAINE, Really stupid. ,18
26183,JERRY," Hey, I just said it was stupid.",18
26184,GEORGE, What about this leftover Chinese food?,18
26185,JERRY, Take it.,18
26186,ELAINE, I can't believe you said that.,18
26187,JERRY," Hey, would you stop it already?",18
26188,ELAINE," So, what’d she say?",18
26189,JERRY," I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.",18
26190,GEORGE,"  This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. ",18
26191,ELAINE, I have a good masseuse you could go to.,18
26192,JERRY," Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.",18
26193,GEORGE, Physical therapy is covered by insurance?,18
26194,JERRY, Yeah.,18
26195,GEORGE, You don't have to pay for the massage?,18
26196,JERRY, Not if you have a doctor's note.,18
26197,ELAINE, So where do you get this note?,18
26198,JERRY," Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.",18
26199,GEORGE," Right, your friend Roy.",18
26200,ELAINE, What's the name of this physical therapist?,18
26201,JERRY," I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.",18
26202,GEORGE, And you don't have to pay.,18
26203,GEORGE," We have a, three-o'clock appointments.",18
26204,RECEPTIONIST," George and Elaine, right?",18
26205,ELAINE, Right.,18
26206,RECEPTIONIST," Could you fill these out for me please? And um, Elaine, you'll be seeing Julianna…",18
26207,ELAINE,  Ok.,18
26208,RECEPTIONIST," … And George, you'll be with Raymond.",18
26209,GEORGE," Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?",18
26210,RECEPTIONIST, Yes.,18
26211,GEORGE," But, uh, Raymond is a man.",18
26212,RECEPTIONIST, That's right.,18
26213,GEORGE, I can't get a massage from a man.,18
26214,ELAINE, Why not?,18
26215,GEORGE," What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.",18
26216,ELAINE," No, I don't want the man either.",18
26217,GEORGE," What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.",18
26218,ELAINE, He'd just be touching your back.,18
26219,GEORGE, He'd just be touching your back too.,18
26220,ELAINE," No, it could get sexual.",18
26221,GEORGE," I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.",18
26222,ELAINE, I wouldn't be comfortable.,18
26223,GEORGE, I would? What if something happens?,18
26224,ELAINE, What could happen?,18
26225,GEORGE, What if it felt good?,18
26226,ELAINE, It's supposed to feel good.,18
26227,GEORGE, I don't want it to feel good.,18
26228,ELAINE, Then why get the massage?,18
26229,GEORGE, Exactly!,18
26230,RAYMOND, George?,18
26231,GEORGE, Yes?,18
26232,RAYMOND, I'm Raymond. ,18
26233,GEORGE, Hello.,18
26234,RAYMOND, Are you ready? ,18
26235,RAYMOND, …And then Julianna asked me if I wanted to join her here in the office.,18
26236,GEORGE, Really.,18
26237,RAYMOND, Use to be a flight attendant.,18
26238,GEORGE, Oh boy.,18
26239,RAYMOND," Ya know, why don't ya, open those pants, it's gonna be a lot easier that way.",18
26240,RAYMOND, So what do you do?,18
26241,GEORGE, What?,18
26242,RAYMOND," I said, 'What do you do?'.",18
26243,GEORGE, I-I don't know.,18
26244,RAYMOND, You don't know what you do?,18
26245,GEORGE, Nah.,18
26246,RAYMOND," Ohh-ho, come on. Hey, you're very tense.",18
26247,GEORGE," hu, Coffee. Too much coffee .",18
26248,RAYMOND," Okay, just take off those pants now, and I'll work the hamstring.",18
26249,GEORGE," Oh, the hamstring’s fine.",18
26250,RAYMOND, But you wrote that it was tender. ,18
26251,GEORGE," I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote.",18
26252,RAYMOND, I'll check it out. ,18
26253,GEORGE, Are you sure?,18
26254,RAYMOND," Yeah, take 'em off. ",18
26255,RAYMOND, How did you hurt this?,18
26256,GEORGE, I don't know.,18
26257,RAYMOND, You don't know?,18
26258,GEORGE, No.,18
26259,RAYMOND, But you just told me--,18
26260,GEORGE, Korea.,18
26261,RAYMOND, You hurt it in Korea?,18
26262,GEORGE, What?,18
26263,RAYMOND, The hamstring.,18
26264,GEORGE, Korea.,18
26265,RAYMOND, How?,18
26266,GEORGE, Hamstring.,18
26267,RAYMOND, How did you hurt the hamstring?,18
26268,GEORGE, Hotel.,18
26269,ELAINE, How'd it go? George?,18
26270,JERRY," No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.",18
26271,JERRY, What's with you?,18
26272,GEORGE, A... ah...,18
26273,JERRY," Yes, A...?",18
26274,GEORGE, A man gave me...,18
26275,JERRY," Yes, a man gave you...?",18
26276,GEORGE," A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu…",18
26277,JERRY, So?,18
26278,GEORGE," So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh…",18
26279,JERRY, He was what?!,18
26280,GEORGE, He-he was uh… touching and rubbing. ,18
26281,JERRY, That's a massage.,18
26282,GEORGE, And then I took my pants off.,18
26283,JERRY, You took your pants off?,18
26284,GEORGE, For my hamstring.,18
26285,JERRY, Oh.,18
26286,GEORGE," He got about uh, two inches from... there.",18
26287,JERRY, Really?,18
26288,GEORGE, I think it moved.,18
26289,JERRY, Moved?,18
26290,GEORGE," It may have moved, I don't know.",18
26291,JERRY, I'm sure it didn't move.,18
26292,GEORGE, It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.,18
26293,JERRY," Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.",18
26294,GEORGE," No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.",18
26295,JERRY," Okay, so what if it moved?",18
26296,GEORGE, That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.,18
26297,JERRY," That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.",18
26298,GEORGE, You think it's contact? It has to be touched?,18
26299,JERRY, That's what a gym teacher once told me.,18
26300,KRAMER, Hey.,18
26301,JERRY, Hey.,18
26302,KRAMER," I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.",18
26303,JERRY, Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts?,18
26304,KRAMER, Yeah. Joe DiMaggio.,18
26305,JERRY," No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.",18
26306,KRAMER, Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.,18
26307,GEORGE, I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.,18
26308,JERRY, I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.,18
26309,KRAMER, Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?,18
26310,JERRY," He can have a donut,",18
26311,KRAMER, Yeah.,18
26312,JERRY, …but not at Dinky.,18
26313,GEORGE," I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.",18
26314,KRAMER," Look I'm tellin--  I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.",18
26315,GEORGE," The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.",18
26316,JERRY, I never said I'd do that.,18
26317,GEORGE," What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.",18
26318,JERRY, I don't know how I feel about it.,18
26319,GEORGE," Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?",18
26320,JERRY," Alright, alright.",18
26321,KRAMER," A stall man, huh? ",18
26322,GEORGE, All right -- ,18
26323,KRAMER, Wha-ha-a-at? ,18
26324,JERRY," ...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.",18
26325,GEORGE, He didn't say he can't.,18
26326,JERRY," I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.",18
26327,GEORGE, He doesn't feel funny.,18
26328,JERRY, If he does.,18
26329,GEORGE, Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.,18
26330,JERRY, He feels funny. You don't have to do this.,18
26331,GEORGE, He knows that!,18
26332,JERRY," Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?",18
26333,GEORGE," Oh, can you be any more dramatic?",18
26334,ROY," Don't be ridiculous.  Holyfield. He's a good friend of one of my patients. He's got a hell of a body, doesn't he?",18
26335,GEORGE, How would I know?,18
26336,ROY, Do you like him?,18
26337,GEORGE," What do you mean, like him?",18
26338,ROY, Do you like him?,18
26339,GEORGE, I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.,18
26340,ROY, How come you don't like him?,18
26341,GEORGE, Why should I?,18
26342,JERRY, What is the matter with you?,18
26343,GEORGE," Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?",18
26344,ROY," So, you want the notes?",18
26345,JERRY," You don't have to, really.",18
26346,ROY," Nah nah, it's ok.",18
26347,JERRY," We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George?  George?",18
26348,JERRY, Well what about the week after?,18
26349,JERRY, No appointments at all? ,18
26350,ELAINE, What? ,18
26351,JERRY," Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it.  I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane.  What's with you?",18
26352,ELAINE, What?,18
26353,JERRY," Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.",18
26354,ELAINE," Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.",18
26355,KRAMER," Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.",18
26356,JERRY, Uh huh.,18
26357,KRAMER, Yeah.,18
26358,ELAINE, Joe DiMaggio?,18
26359,KRAMER," Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.",18
26360,ELAINE, Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?!,18
26361,KRAMER, That's right.,18
26362,JERRY," See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.",18
26363,KRAMER," Oh, he's a dunker.",18
26364,ELAINE, Why couldn't he be a dunker?,18
26365,KRAMER," And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that he’ll look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang*  You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip*  *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.",18
26366,ELAINE, So then what?,18
26367,KRAMER," Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.",18
26368,ELAINE, Why didn't you just call out his name?,18
26369,JERRY, What happened to you?,18
26370,GEORGE, These kids called me a Mary.,18
26371,ELAINE, A what?,18
26372,GEORGE," I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this.  And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.",18
26373,KRAMER," Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.",18
26374,ELAINE," Hey, George? What is this?  What is that? No really, what is that?",18
26375,JERRY," Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye.  That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.",18
26376,KRAMER ," ...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe...",18
26377,JERRY, I told you.,18
26378,GEORGE, Told me what?,18
26379,JERRY, I told you we shouldn't do it.,18
26380,GEORGE, He didn't say anything.,18
26381,JERRY," He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.",18
26382,ELAINE, Three notes?,18
26383,JERRY," Yeah, you, me and George.",18
26384,ELAINE, You got me a note?,18

26388,ELAINE, I got a note from my gynecologist.,18
26389,JERRY, Why'd you do that?,18
26390,ELAINE, I didn't know you were getting me a note.,18
26391,JERRY, Of course I was getting you a note.,18
26392,ELAINE, But you didn't say anything. Ohhh…,18
26393,JERRY," Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.",18
26394,GEORGE, No Doctor--,18
26395,ELAINE, Wait a--,18
26396,KRAMER," How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.",18

26429,JERRY," Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?",18
26430,ROY," Well, nothing really, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along with our story.",18
26431,JERRY, What? The physical therapist? Why?,18
26432,ROY, She just has to say the complaint was related to a dental problem.,18
26433,GEORGE, How ya doing?,18
26434,JERRY," Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.",18

26453,GEORGE," Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle.",18
26454,ELAINE, Of what?,18
26455,GEORGE," And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say ""Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!""",18
26456,ELAINE, What do they do?,18
26457,GEORGE," They talk back. They go, ""Hey George, how's it going?"" I say, ""Get the hell out of here!""",18

26474,JERRY," What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, ""Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'""",18
26475,JERRY,"JERRY: Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide  Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ...",19
26476,PATRICE, Everyone in my family's creative. And even though I'm working as an accountant now I'd really like to eventually live exclusively on my pappe-ay mache-ay hats,19

26478,PATRICE, uh uh,19
26479,GEORGE, What if it rains?,19
26480,PATRICE, They're art. You hang them on the wall.,19
26481,GEORGE,"Oh, art!",19
26482,PATRICE, It's my creative outlet. One of my passions.,19
26483,GEORGE, Any money in it?,19
26484,PATRICE," Who so belongs only to his age, references only popenjays and mumbo jumbos",19

26531,ELAINE, Why is she doing this?,19
26532,JERRY, I don't know. It must be love.,19

26540,PATRICE, You're not telling me the truth. I must have done something.,19
26541,GEORGE, I have a fear of intimacy,19
26542,PATRICE, Don't give me cliches. I have a right to know. What did I do wrong?,19

26554,JERRY, Have you ever been through an audit?,19
26555,ELAINE, No.,19

26576,GEORGE," Because I uh, I told her the truth.",19
26577,JERRY," Oh, my God.",19
26578,GEORGE, It's OK.,19
26579,JERRY, It's unheard of ...,19

26582,GEORGE, I told her that she was pretentious.,19
26583,JERRY, Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want,19

26646,ELAINE," Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.",19

26652,JERRY," Well, where is she?",19
26653,GEORGE, A mental institution.,19
26654,JERRY," Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good  feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it.  There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know,  I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this  I think that would really help a lot.",19
26655,JERRY, A mental institution?,19
26656,KRAMER, You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.,19
26657,GEORGE," It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.",19
26658,ELAINE, Who told you this,19
26659,GEORGE, Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.,19
26660,KRAMER," My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.",19
26661,JERRY, You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!,19
26662,GEORGE, She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.,19
26663,JERRY, So what now?,19
26664,GEORGE, I don't know.,19
26665,JERRY, Can we go out there?,19
26666,GEORGE, Where?,19
26667,JERRY, Woodhaven.,19
26668,GEORGE, We could.,19
26669,GEORGE, I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.,19
26670,JERRY," My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' ""where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?""",19
26671,GEORGE, I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.,19
26672,JERRY, That'd be great. There's no wrong answer.,19
26673,GEORGE, Potato,19

26682,KRAMER, Hey.,19
26683,ELAINE, WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON.,19
26684,KRAMER," Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.",19
26685,TINA," Kramer, are you coming back to bed?",19
26686,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby.",19
26687,TINA," Oh, hi Elaine.  What did you think of the coffee table?",19
26688,ELAINE, It's invisible.,19
26689,KRAMER," So, is everything cool? or what?",19
26690,TINA," Yeah, um, you seem little bit dysfunctional.",19
26691,ELAINE," Well,",19
26692,TINA, Come on Elaine. just tell us the truth.,19
26693,ELAINE," The Truth!, You want The Truth?",19
26694,PATRICE, Who are you?,19
26695,GEORGE," Oh, this is my friend Jerry.",19
26696,PATRICE, Why are you talking like that? And what do YOU want?,19
26697,JERRY," Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.",19
26698,PATRICE, George thinks I'm pretentious.,19
26699,GEORGE," Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.",19
26700,PATRICE, You're just trying to take it all back because you're feeling guilty I'm in here.,19
26701,GEORGE," No, that's not it at all.",19
26702,PATRICE, Don't LIE George.,19
26703,GEORGE ,I'M NOT A LIER!,19
26704,GEORGE," Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool ",19
26705,JERRY, Just chatting. Friendly.,19
26706,GEORGE," All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.",19
26707,PATRICE, I know what you said. You can't change that.,19
26708,GEORGE, What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.,19
26709,JERRY," It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?",19
26710,GEORGE," You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.",19
26711,PATRICE, You mean that?,19
26712,GEORGE, Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.,19
26713,JERRY," He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.",19
26714,PATRICE," Papers? Oh, Jerry, You're the Jerome with the tax problem. You know after that day with George I got so cuckoo I threw out all your papers. So I'd love to help you but I'll need the copies.",19
26715,JERRY, there are no copies.,19
26716,PATRICE, So are you saying you want to continue seeing me?,19
26717,JERRY, Who makes copies?,19
26718,ELAINE, The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.,19
26719,KRAMER," Oh,",19
26720,TINA," Kramer,",19
26721,TINA, Here Kramer?,19
26722,KRAMER," No, lets go to the couch...",19
26723,JERRY," Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.",19
26724,JERRY, Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.,19
26725,ELAINE, I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.,19
26726,JERRY, George?,19
26727,GEORGE, I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE,19

26734,GEORGE, You're going that way anyway!,19
26735,JERRY," I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go ""Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!""",19
26736,JERRY," I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? ""You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks."" Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know",20
26737,HELEN,  They were supposed to be here at 7,20
26738,MORTY,  What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.,20

26747,HELEN, I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.,20
26748,JERRY, What's the difference?,20
26749,HELEN, You could have used our car.,20
26750,JERRY, I don't wanna use your car.,20
26751,HELEN, What's wrong with our car?,20
26752,JERRY, Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?,20
26753,HELEN, We don't use it.,20

26771,ELAINE,"  Ooh, you have a lake?",20
26772,JERRY, The lake isn't real.,20
26773,HELEN, The lake is real.,20
26774,MORTY, Are you kidding? They built the lake.,20
26775,HELEN, But it's real. It's water.,20

26777,JERRY, I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.,20

26780,HELEN, I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.,20
26781,ELAINE, I can't kick you out of your bed.,20

26784,HELEN," But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.",20
26785,JERRY,  What about you?,20

26787,JERRY,  What about him?,20
26788,HELEN," Don't worry, he's comfortable.",20
26789,MORTY, I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.,20
26790,HELEN, Will you stop?,20
26791,ELAINE," Yeah, I'll just stay in here. ",20
26792,HELEN," Jerry,  Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.",20
26793,JERRY," Na, that's not such a good idea.",20
26794,HELEN, Well I tought that...,20
26795,JERRY, Not now. She's right inside.,20
26796,HELEN,  What happened?,20
26797,JERRY, I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.,20
26798,HELEN, What does that mean?,20
26799,JERRY, Well...,20
26800,MORTY,  Why are you whispering?,20
26801,JERRY," Shh! Nothing, nothing.",20

26803,MORTY,  What about her?,20
26804,JERRY,"  ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh  you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time.  We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.",20
26805,MORTY,  Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.,20
26806,HELEN, He's an idealist.,20
26807,MORTY, What the hell are you looking for?,20
26808,JERRY, I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.,20
26809,HELEN, He likes looking.,20
26810,MORTY, So look.,20
26811,HELEN, But how long can you look?,20
26812,JERRY, I'm going for the record.,20
26813,HELEN, You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.,20
26814,JERRY," Oh, come on.",20
26815,HELEN, This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.,20

26834,MORTY, What did you have? You had the minute steak?,20
26835,JACK, Yeah.,20
26836,MORTY, Did you have a coke or what?,20
26837,JACK, I did NOT have a coke.,20
26838,MORTY, Somebody had a coke.,20
26839,HELEN, Oh I had a coke.,20
26840,DORIS, And I had the scampi.,20

26846,JERRY, What kind of pen is that?,20
26847,JACK, This pen?,20
26848,JERRY, Yeah.,20
26849,JACK, This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.,20
26850,JERRY, Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?,20
26851,JACK, Oh it was a gift.,20
26852,JERRY, Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.,20
26853,JACK, Take the pen.,20
26854,JERRY, Oh no.,20
26855,JACK, Go ahead.,20
26856,JERRY, I couldn't,20
26857,JACK," Come on, take the pen!",20
26858,JERRY, I can't take it.,20
26859,JACK, Do me a personal favor!,20
26860,JERRY," No, I'm not...",20
26861,JACK, Take the pen!,20
26862,JERRY, I cannot take it!,20
26863,JACK, Take the pen!,20
26864,JERRY, Are you sure?,20
26865,JACK, Positive! Take the pen!,20

26875,JERRY, What he gave it to me.,20
26876,HELEN, You didn't have to take it.,20
26877,MORTY, Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.,20
26878,JERRY, He offered it to me.,20
26879,HELEN, Because you made such a big fuss about it.,20
26880,JERRY, I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?,20
26881,HELEN, You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? ,20
26882,JERRY, He could have said,20
26883,HELEN, He loves that pen.,20
26884,MORTY, Oh come on!,20
26885,HELEN," He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.",20
26886,JERRY," If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.",20
26887,HELEN, He didn't think you'd accpet.,20
26888,JERRY," Well, he was wrong.",20
26889,HELEN, I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. ,20
26890,JERRY, So you want me to return it?,20
26891,HELEN, Yes.,20
26892,MORTY, He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.,20
26893,JERRY, Hey I don't even want the pen now!,20
26894,MORTY," Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!",20
26895,ELAINE," Here, let me see it.  Hey, it writes upside down.",20
26896,ELAINE, Come in.,20
26897,JERRY, Are you O.K. in here?,20
26898,ELAINE, Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?,20
26899,JERRY," It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.",20
26900,ELAINE, Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.,20
26901,JERRY, Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.,20
26902,ELAINE, I am never gonna fall asleep.,20
26903,JERRY," Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.",20
26904,ELAINE, How can they not put the air conditioning on?,20
26905,JERRY, They're nuts with temperature.,20
26906,ELAINE, This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.,20
26907,JERRY, How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?,20
26908,ELAINE," I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.",20
26909,JERRY," It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. ",20
26910,MORTY," Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?",20
26911,JERRY, Stay on Biscayne.,20
26912,HELEN, You're going underwater?,20
26913,JERRY, Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.,20
26914,HELEN, What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?,20
26915,JERRY, What's so special up here?,20
26916,ELAINE, Oh!,20
26917,HELEN, What's the matter?,20
26918,ELAINE, My back.,20
26919,HELEN, What happened?,20
26920,ELAINE, That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.,20
26921,HELEN,  I told you to let us sleep in there.,20
26922,JERRY, Then YOU would be hunched over.,20
26923,ELAINE, I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.,20
26924,JERRY, You can't go?,20
26925,HELEN, So stay home.,20
26926,ELAINE, You can go.,20
26927,JERRY, Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.,20
26928,HELEN, Don't go.,20
26929,JERRY, You sure?,20
26930,MORTY, Maybe you should see a doctor.,20
26931,JERRY, We'll stay in a hotel tonight.,20
26932,ELAINE,  Yes!,20
26933,HELEN," No, we'll stay in there.",20
26934,JERRY, Why don't you get a new sofa?,20
26935,MORTY, Nobody uses it.,20
26936,JERRY, I'm buying you a new sofa.,20
26937,HELEN," Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy.",20
26938,ELAINE," Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.",20
26939,HELEN, You're hot?,20
26940,ELAINE, I've lost 6 pounds.,20
26941,HELEN, I don't even know how to work it.,20
26942,MORTY, I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.,20
26943,EVELYN, Is everybody up?,20
26944,JERRY, Hi. How are you?,20
26945,EVELYN, Hello Jerry.,20
26946,JERRY," Evelyn, this is Elaine.",20
26947,ELAINE,  Hi Evelyn.,20
26948,EVELYN, Jerry you got thin.,20
26949,JERRY, Too thin?,20
26950,HELEN, Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.,20
26951,EVELYN, So where's the new pen? ,20
26952,JERRY,  What?,20
26953,EVELYN, The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you.,20
26954,HELEN, How did you know that?,20
26955,EVELYN, Blanche told me.,20
26956,HELEN, Blanche?,20
26957,EVELYN, That's some good pen. It writes upside down.,20
26958,ELAINE, The astronauts use them.,20
26959,HELEN, What did Blanche say?,20
26960,EVELYN, I don't know. She said Jerry wanted the pen.,20
26961,JERRY, I never really wanted the pen.,20
26962,MORTY, He gave him the pen.,20
26963,HELEN, Morty.,20
26964,EVELYN, Why you don't like the pen?,20
26965,JERRY," No, no, I...",20
26966,EVELYN," Cause if you don't like it, give it back to him.",20
26967,HELEN, Is that what she said?,20
26968,EVELYN, Who?,20
26969,HELEN, Blanche.,20
26970,EVELYN, What are you talking about?,20
26971,HELEN, Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head.  You're giving him back that pen. ,20
26972,ELAINE, Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!,20
26973,MORTY,  Oh! I forgot all about it.,20
26974,JERRY," All I said was ""I like the pen"".",20
26975,MORTY, How the hell do you work this thing?,20
26976,HELEN, Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.,20
26977,ELAINE," No no, I wanna go.",20
26978,HELEN, But your back hurts.,20
26979,MORTY, Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.,20
26980,ELAINE," Oh, oh, O.K.  You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.",20
26981,HELEN, No. I'm fine.,20
26982,ELAINE, You're not too cold?,20
26983,HELEN, No.,20
26984,JERRY, Don't be alarmed.,20
26985,MORTY, Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?,20
26986,JERRY, I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.,20
26987,HELEN, Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?,20
26988,JERRY,  How are you doing?,20
26989,ELAINE, Having a good time!,20
26990,JERRY, Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?,20
26991,HELEN, What happened to your eyes?,20
26992,JERRY, Well I started to go under...,20
26993,HELEN, With the instructor?,20
26994,JERRY," Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.",20
26995,HELEN, I told you...,20
26996,JACK, Excuse me.  Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes.  The shoes have to match the pocketbook.  What's she doing? Yoga?,20
26997,ELAINE, My back hurts.,20
26998,JACK, Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.,20
26999,MORTY, We got plenty of time.,20
27000,JACK,  What happened to you?,20
27001,JERRY, I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.,20
27002,HELEN, It's from scuba diving.,20
27003,JACK, What's there to see underwater?,20
27004,JERRY," Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.",20
27005,JACK, You what?,20
27006,JERRY," I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. ",20
27007,JACK, Well I mean...,20
27008,JERRY, Take it.,20
27009,JACK, All right! ,20
27010,MORTY," You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.",20
27011,JACK, Whose pen?,20
27012,MORTY, His pen.,20
27013,JACK, This happens to be my pen.,20
27014,MORTY, You didn't give it to him.,20
27015,JACK, What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.,20
27016,MORTY, Where do you come off with this crap?,20
27017,JACK," Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?",20
27018,MORTY, You said you didn't want it!,20
27019,JACK, Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!,20
27020,MORTY, Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?,20
27021,JACK, Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!,20
27022,MORTY, Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!,20
27023,JACK, Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!,20
27024,MORTY, I don't want it!,20
27025,JACK, I don't want it!,20
27026,MORTY," You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!",20
27027,JACK, Listen do you think I give a damn?,20
27028,MORTY, Aah!  The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.,20
27029,JERRY, What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?,20
27030,HELEN, I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. ,20
27031,JERRY, Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?,20
27032,MORTY," yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.",20
27033,JERRY, Well. This should be a very interesting evening.,20
27034,ELAINE,  Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?,20
27035,PHOTOGRAPHER, Say astronaut.,20
27036,ELAINE, Say what?  Say what?,20
27037,JERRY,  You took too many of those pills.,20
27038,MORTY, Astronaut?,20
27039,HELEN, Say it.,20
27040,ELAINE,  Astro...naut!,20
27041,MORTY, Good. O.K.  What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?,20
27042,JERRY, Oh God. ,20
27043,JERRY,  Uncle Leo.,20
27044,LEO, Hello!,20
27045,STELLA, Morty are you nervous?,20
27046,MORTY, What nervous?,20
27047,LEO,  What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?,20
27048,JERRY, I've got a black eye.,20
27049,STELLA,  Hello.,20
27050,JERRY," Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.",20
27051,HELEN,  STELLA! STELLA!,20
27052,JERRY,  Her back hurts.,20
27053,STELLA," Humm... We saw you on ""The Tonight Show"" last week.",20
27054,LEO, I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.,20
27055,JERRY," No, no.",20
27056,LEO, You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.,20
27057,ELAINE,  STELLA! STELLA!,20
27058,LEO," Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.",20
27059,MORTY, What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!,20
27060,LEO," You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you!  Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.",20
27061,STELLA,"  This better be good. I'm missing ""Golden Girls"" for this.",20
27062,HELEN,  I hate her like poison.,20
27063,JACK,"  Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld  A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.",20
27064,MORTY,  Slept on the job? ,20
27065,JACK," Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. ",20
27066,HELEN,  He's joking.,20
27067,JACK, His administration did excel in one department,20
27068,MORTY,  That's what you say.,20
27069,JACK," But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. ",20
27070,MORTY,  Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! ,20
27071,JERRY, Dad!,20
27072,MORTY,"  He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!",20
27073,JACK, He gave it to me!,20
27074,MORTY," Come on. That's enough, sit down!",20
27075,JACK, I'm not sitting down!,20
27076,JACK, Ow! You broke my dental plate!  Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. ,20
27077,HELEN," Jerry, do your act.",20
27078,JERRY,  I can't. Nobody's even listening.,20
27079,HELEN, They're all gonna leave.,20
27080,JERRY,  Oh God!  huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? ,20
27081,MAN IN THE CROWD, Who are you?,20
27082,JERRY,  Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?,20
27083,WOMAN IN THE CROWD,  Not my Harry. He flies first class.,20
27084,JERRY, Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?,20
27085,MAN IN THE CROWD, I'd rather have a bottle of scotch!,20
27086,HELEN,  Do the dog routine.,20
27087,JERRY, All I said was I liked the pen!,20
27088,ELAINE,  STELLA!,20
27089,CHIROPRACTOR, You could aggravate it. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least five days.,20
27090,ELAINE, Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?,20
27091,JERRY, There must be some mistake.,20
27092,CHIROPRACTOR, I'm afraid not.,20
27093,ELAINE,  Five days. Here.,20
27094,HELEN,  So we have you for five more days!,20
27095,JERRY,  Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...,20
27096,ELAINE, Excuse me?,20
27097,JERRY, Nothing.,20
27098,EVELYN, Good morning.,20
27099,JERRY, Hi Evelyn.,20
27100,EVELYN,  Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?,20
27101,HELEN, I don't think so.,20
27102,EVELYN, Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case.,20
27103,HELEN, Well I'll ask him when he gets up.,20
27104,EVELYN," Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to suck up to.",20
27105,MORTY, Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?,20
27106,HELEN, I was very comfortable.,20
27107,EVELYN," Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out.",20
27108,HELEN, It's in the constitution.,20
27109,MORTY,  Who are you?,20
27110,CHIROPRACTOR, I'm a chiropractor.,20
27111,MORTY, What are you kidding me?,20
27112,ELAINE,  Five more days?,20
27113,JERRY, Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. ,20
27114,JERRY," Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going",20
27115,JERRY," So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!",21
27116,GAVIN," Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel without him.",21
27117,JERRY, Is he on the plane now?,21
27118,GAVIN," Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have any pets?",21
27119,JERRY," Uh, just my next door neighbor.",21
27120,GAVIN, You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways that you never could have thought possible.,21
27121,JERRY," Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?",21
27122,JERRY, What's the matter?,21
27123,GAVIN," Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy.",21
27124,GAVIN, My dog. What about my dog?,21
27125,GAVIN, Jerry?,21
27126,JERRY, Huh? How you feeling?,21
27127,GAVIN, Would you take care of Farfel?,21
27128,JERRY, Farfel?,21
27129,JERRY, The dog? The dog??,21
27130,GAVIN, I'm sure it's only for a day or two.,21
27131,JERRY," But, you know, what if, you know?",21
27132,GAVIN," Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you.",21
27133,JERRY, The dog?,21
27134,JERRY," Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up!  So what would you do?",21
27135,ELAINE," Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.",21
27136,JERRY ," STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!!  Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.",21
27137,ELAINE, If only.,21
27138,JERRY," Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.",21
27139,ELAINE," Hey, when you walk him, do ya...",21
27140,JERRY, Do I what?,21
27141,ELAINE, Do you pick it up?,21
27142,JERRY," Yes, I pick it up.",21
27143,ELAINE, You pick it up?!?,21
27144,JERRY, Well you have to.,21
27145,ELAINE," Oh, boy would I love to see that.",21
27146,JERRY," SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it!  I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?",21
27147,ELAINE," Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.",21
27148,JERRY," No, I tried. they don't know anything.  You gotta put the syrup in first.",21
27149,ELAINE," No, milk.",21
27150,JERRY," I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.",21
27151,ELAINE, What is a bender anyhow?,21
27152,JERRY," I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.",21
27153,ELAINE, I can't believe he hasn't called.,21
27154,JERRY," Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!",21
27155,KRAMER," Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.",21
27156,JERRY, Why?,21
27157,ELAINE," We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.",21
27158,KRAMER," I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.",21
27159,JERRY, You're breaking up?,21
27160,KRAMER," Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.",21
27161,ELAINE," Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.",21
27162,KRAMER," Woah, you didn't like her?",21
27163,ELAINE," If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.",21
27164,JERRY, I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.,21
27165,KRAMER, How come you never said anything?,21
27166,JERRY, Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.,21
27167,KRAMER, I tell you.,21
27168,JERRY, You. I'm talking about people.,21
27169,ELAINE, Are we still going to the movies tonight?,21
27170,JERRY," No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.",21
27171,ELAINE, Just me and George?,21
27172,JERRY, Sure.,21
27173,ELAINE, But we need you.,21
27174,JERRY, What do you need me for?,21
27175,ELAINE, Because... Yeah?,21
27176,GEORGE, Prognosis Negative! ,21
27177,ELAINE," Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?",21
27178,JERRY," No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!",21
27179,ELAINE, Just me and George alone?,21
27180,GEORGE," Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!",21
27181,JERRY, I can't go.,21
27182,GEORGE," Can't go, Why not?",21
27183,JERRY, Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.,21
27184,GEORGE, I thought Kramer was watching.,21
27185,JERRY, He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.,21
27186,GEORGE," Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.",21
27187,JERRY," No, I don't want that smell in the house.",21
27188,GEORGE, You spritz a little Lysol on it.,21
27189,JERRY," No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.",21
27190,GEORGE, So we're not going?,21
27191,JERRY, Nah. You two go.,21
27192,GEORGE, Oh. You still wanna go?,21
27193,ELAINE," Do, do you?",21
27194,GEORGE, If you want.,21
27195,ELAINE," It,s, it's up to you.",21
27196,JERRY, Go ahead.,21
27197,ELAINE," Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?",21
27198,GEORGE, Ponce de Leon? Okay.  You sure you don't wanna go?,21
27199,JERRY, I want to but I can't.,21
27200,ELAINE, Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.,21
27201,JERRY, No.,21
27202,GEORGE, What about this--,21
27203,JERRY," Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.",21
27204,ELAINE," I know, it's not that.",21
27205,GEORGE, It's just we want you to go.,21
27206,JERRY," Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!",21
27207,JERRY," On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?",21
27208,GEORGE, So how long did you live there?,21
27209,ELAINE, About three years.,21
27210,GEORGE, That's pretty long.,21
27211,ELAINE, Hmm.,21
27212,GEORGE," It's not that long, really.",21
27213,ELAINE, Yeah.,21
27214,GEORGE, And then you came here.,21
27215,ELAINE, Yeah. So I've been here about six years.,21
27216,GEORGE ," Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup.",21
27217,JERRY," Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!",21
27218,KRAMER," I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.",21
27219,GEORGE, I like herbal tea.,21
27220,GEORGE, Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.,21
27221,ELAINE, Jerry likes Morning Thunder.,21
27222,GEORGE, Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?,21
27223,ELAINE, Yeah.,21
27224,GEORGE," Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.",21
27225,ELAINE, Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.,21
27226,GEORGE, You don't tell him?,21
27227,ELAINE ," No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, ""God, I feel great!""",21
27228,GEORGE , You don't tell him?,21
27229,ELAINE, No.,21
27230,GEORGE, That is so funny!,21
27231,ELAINE, I know!,21
27232,GEORGE," Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!",21
27233,KRAMER," Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!",21
27234,JERRY," That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much.  That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!",21
27235,ELAINE, It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.,21
27236,JERRY," Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.",21
27237,ELAINE, The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.,21
27238,JERRY," Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down.  What?",21
27239,ELAINE, Do you have to?,21
27240,JERRY, What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.,21
27241,ELAINE," You know, the guy might have just lost your number.",21
27242,JERRY, I'm in the book and I have a machine.,21
27243,ELAINE," Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.",21
27244,JERRY, Really? How late are they open?,21
27245,JERRY, What?,21
27246,ELAINE, What is it?,21
27247,KRAMER, I went back with Ellen.,21
27248,ELAINE, Terrific.,21
27249,JERRY," Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.",21
27250,ELAINE," Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.",21
27251,KRAMER, Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?,21
27252,JERRY," Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.",21
27253,KRAMER," From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.",21
27254,ELAINE," Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.",21
27255,JERRY, What are you doing?,21
27256,KRAMER, I'm getting my pot.,21
27257,ELAINE," Kramer, we like her.",21
27258,JERRY, Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?,21
27259,ELAINE, I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.,21
27260,JERRY," I said, ""How come no one's killed her?"" Probably shouldn't have said anything,",21
27261,JERRY, Well.,21
27262,ELAINE, Well.,21
27263,JERRY, everyone knows the first break-up never takes.  Yeah?,21
27264,GEORGE, Prognosis Negative! ,21
27265,JERRY," Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.",21
27266,ELAINE," Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.",21
27267,JERRY," It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.",21
27268,ELAINE," Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.",21
27269,JERRY," I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?",21
27270,ELAINE, We'll see it Sunday.,21
27271,GEORGE," Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?",21
27272,ELAINE," I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.",21
27273,GEORGE, What does this mean?,21
27274,JERRY," Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.",21
27275,GEORGE," What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.",21
27276,JERRY," She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.",21
27277,GEORGE," Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?",21
27278,JERRY," I don't know, regular human time?",21
27279,GEORGE, Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?,21
27280,JERRY, Why shouldn't I go here?,21
27281,ELAINE," Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.",21
27282,GEORGE, And isn't it more fun using the urinal?,21
27283,ELAINE, Yeah.,21
27284,JERRY," Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!",21
27285,GEORGE," Hey, go.",21
27286,ELAINE, Who's stopping you?,21
27287,GEORGE," What, are you doing me a favor?",21
27288,ELAINE, Like we care if you go to the bathroom.,21
27289,GEORGE, How's it going?,21
27290,ELAINE, Good. Good. You?,21
27291,GEORGE, Things are good.,21
27292,ELAINE," Boy, he takes such a long time.",21
27293,GEORGE, I know.,21
27294,ELAINE, You know what he does in there? He gargles.,21
27295,GEORGE, Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?,21
27296,ELAINE," Yeah, he does it like six times a day.",21
27297,GEORGE, How come we never hear him?,21
27298,ELAINE," Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.",21
27299,GEORGE," Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!",21
27300,ELAINE, We talked about that already.,21
27301,GEORGE, Oh.,21
27302,GEORGE, I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.,21
27303,JERRY, So what are calling me six times a day?,21
27304,GEORGE," All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.",21
27305,JERRY, I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.,21
27306,GEORGE, Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.,21
27307,JERRY," It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?",21
27308,GEORGE, Nothing except Prognosis Negative.,21
27309,JERRY," Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.",21
27310,ELAINE," Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!",21
27311,ELAINE," Shut up. Shut up!  Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.",21
27312,GEORGE," I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.",21
27313,JERRY, I don't know what to do.,21
27314,GEORGE," What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.",21
27315,JERRY," I know, I know.",21
27316,GEORGE," So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.",21
27317,JERRY, It is kind of silly.,21
27318,GEORGE, Of course it is.,21
27319,JERRY," I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.",21
27320,GEORGE, Exactly.,21
27321,JERRY, It's not like she's *in* the movie.,21
27322,GEORGE, Right.,21
27323,JERRY," Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.",21
27324,GEORGE," And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.",21
27325,JERRY," How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.",21
27326,GEORGE, Good.,21
27327,JERRY, Saving movies.,21
27328,GEORGE, Ridiculous!,21
27329,JERRY, Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.,21
27330,GEORGE," Oh, you're dead.",21
27331,GAVIN," Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed. Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, I was completely incapacitated. Quiet Farfel!",21
27332,JERRY," You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.",21
27333,GAVIN," Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first, first rate facility, top notch physicians.",21
27334,KRAMER," Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!",21
27335,GAVIN," He won't hurt you, he's just playing.",21
27336,KRAMER, Hey you keep that mutt away from me.,21
27337,GAVIN, Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.,21
27338,ELLEN," Kramer, are you coming?",21
27339,JERRY," Oh, hi Ellen.",21
27340,ELLEN, Get in here.,21
27341,JERRY," Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...",21
27342,GAVIN, Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him before the month is out.,21
27343,JERRY, Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.,21
27344,ELAINE, We made plans.,21
27345,JERRY, Why don't we just rent a movie?,21
27346,ELAINE, I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.,21
27347,JERRY," No, it&Mac226s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...",21
27348,ELAINE," Jerry, you promised me we'd go.",21
27349,JERRY," Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.",21
27350,ELAINE," Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.",21
27351,JERRY, You and George got together?,21
27352,ELAINE," Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.",21
27353,JERRY, Hello.,21
27354,KRAMER," Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.",21
27355,JERRY, What's up?,21
27356,KRAMER," Well, ah you were right.",21
27357,JERRY, About what?,21
27358,KRAMER," Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.",21
27359,JERRY, Too bad.,21
27360,ELAINE, I thought she was the one.,21
27361,KRAMER, I'll bring back the pot.,21
27362,ELAINE," Okay, c'mon it's movie time.",21
27363,KRAMER," Hey, what are you gonna see?",21
27364,JERRY, Prognosis Negative.,21
27365,KRAMER," Hey, that's supposed to be great.",21
27366,JERRY, It's not.,21
27367,KRAMER, How do you know?,21
27368,JERRY, I have an instinct for these things.,21
27369,JERRY," I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, ""Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me."" But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?",21
27370,JERRY," Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'",22
27371,JERRY, Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?,22
27372,KRAMER, enters,22
27373,JERRY," Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.",22
27374,KRAMER, What's the problem?,22
27375,JERRY, This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.,22
27376,KRAMER," Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000",22
27377,JERRY, It doesn't work like that.,22
27378,KRAMER," If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000",22
27379,JERRY, It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...,22
27380,JERRY, That orange dress is burned in my memory,22
27381,KRAMER," Oh, memory burn.",22
27382,JERRY, I wonder what ever happened to her.,22
27383,KRAMER, How did they ever find you?,22
27384,JERRY," Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.",22
27385,JERRY, It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library,22
27386,KRAMER, You know I never got a library card.,22
27387,JERRY,  Coming down.,22
27388,KRAMER," It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,",22
27389,JERRY, I gotta go to the library. You want to go?,22
27390,KRAMER," Yeah,",22
27391,KRAMER," The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.													JERRY",22
27392,READER, Shhh.,22
27393,KRAMER, Tryin' to save a quarter.,22
27394,JERRY, I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.,22
27395,JERRY, This woman's completely ignoring me.,22
27396,KRAMER, Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.,22
27397,JERRY, Eventually a little shot of penicillin,22
27398,LIBRARIAN, Yes?,22
27399,JERRY, Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.,22
27400,LIBRARIAN," Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has been turned over to our library investigation officer Mr. Bookman.",22
27401,KRAMER," Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?",22
27402,LIBRARIAN, It's true.,22
27403,KRAMER," That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.",22
27404,LIBRARIAN, Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I think he's heard all the jokes.,22
27405,JERRY, Can I speak with this Bookman?,22
27406,LIBRARIAN, Just a second.,22
27407,GEORGE," Jerry, Jerry",22
27408,JERRY, What?,22
27409,GEORGE, I think I saw him. I think it's him.,22
27410,JERRY, Who?,22
27411,GEORGE, Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine,22
27412,JERRY, Yeah.,22
27413,KRAMER, yeah,22
27414,GEORGE, I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.,22
27415,READER, Shhh.,22
27416,JERRY,"  Haymen, Are you sure?",22
27417,GEORGE," He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.",22
27418,JERRY, George got him fired. He squealed on him.,22
27419,KRAMER, Ooh tattle tale,22
27420,GEORGE,  I didn't tattle,22
27421,READER, Shh Shh,22
27422,KRAMER, What did this guy do? What happened?,22
27423,GEORGE, There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.,22
27424,KRAMER," Oh come on, You can tell me.",22
27425,GEORGE, Some other time.,22
27426,KRAMER, What tonight?,22
27427,KRAMER, Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.,22
27428,JERRY," Oh, he sang like a canary.",22
27429,LIBRARIAN, Mr. Bookman's not here.,22
27430,JERRY, Not here? Why was I told to come down here?,22
27431,LIBRARIAN, He'll be out all afternoon on a case.,22
27432,KRAMER, He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?,22
27433,JERRY, Well what am I supposed to do now?,22
27434,LIBRARIAN, I'll have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you.,22
27435,JERRY, All right Thanks. Come on lets go,22
27436,GEORGE, Let's see if it's Hayman?,22
27437,KRAMER," Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later.  So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?",22
27438,ELAINE, Where's Karen?,22
27439,SECRETARY, She went to pick up lunch.,22
27440,ELAINE," Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.",22
27441,SECRETARY, She must have forgot.,22
27442,ELAINE, How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?,22
27443,SECRETARY, I don't know anything.,22
27444,ELAINE," Ah, you don't know anything. You see, ""I don't know anything"", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said ""You're crazy.""",22
27445,ELAINE," Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.",22
27446,LIPPMAN," Elaine,",22
27447,ELAINE," Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?",22
27448,LIPPMAN, Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.,22
27449,ELAINE," Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.",22
27450,ELAINE, I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.,22
27451,JERRY, So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!,22
27452,ELAINE," What do you know. You've never worked in an office.  See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!",22
27453,GEORGE," I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?",22
27454,ELAINE, What did he do?,22
27455,GEORGE," He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, ""Costanza"" He'd say, ""Can't stand ja"". ""Can't stand ja"" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.",22
27456,JERRY," I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...",22
27457,GEORGE," OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.",22
27458,JERRY, I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.,22
27459,GEORGE, Little baked beans,22
27460,JERRY, Echh,22
27461,ELAINE, Come on tell me what happened.,22
27462,GEORGE," Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!",22
27463,GEORGE, ... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...,22
27464,HEYMAN, Can't stand ja ... Can't stand ja,22
27465,GEORGE," Yes, Mr. Hayman",22
27466,HEYMAN, Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.,22
27467,GEORGE, Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.,22
27468,HEYMAN," Boxer shorts, ha ha, Well what brand?",22
27469,GEORGE," I'm not really sure, I...",22
27470,HEYMAN, Well let's take a look.,22
27471,GEORGE, He gave me a wedgie.,22
27472,JERRY, He got fired the next day.,22
27473,ELAINE, Why do they call it a wedgie?,22
27474,GEORGE, Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..,22
27475,JERRY, They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.,22
27476,ELAINE, Boys are sick.,22
27477,JERRY, Well what do girls do ?,22
27478,ELAINE, We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.,22
27479,GEORGE, I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226m the guy who ruined his life.,22
27480,KRAMER," Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.",22
27481,JERRY," What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?",22
27482,JERRY," Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?",22
27483,BOOKMAN, You got any coffee?,22
27484,JERRY, Coffee?,22
27485,BOOKMAN, Yeah. Coffee.,22
27486,JERRY," No, I don't drink coffee.",22
27487,BOOKMAN," Yeah, you don't drink coffee? How about instant coffee?",22
27488,JERRY," No, I don't have--",22
27489,BOOKMAN, You don't have any instant coffee?,22
27490,JERRY," Well, I don't normally--",22
27491,BOOKMAN, Who doesn't have instant coffee?,22
27492,JERRY, I don't.,22
27493,BOOKMAN," You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you forget about it. Then later on when you need it, it's there. It lasts forever. It's freeze-dried. Freeze-dried Crystals.",22
27494,JERRY, Really? I'll have to remember that.,22
27495,BOOKMAN, You took this book out in 1971.,22
27496,JERRY," Yes, and I returned it in 1971.",22
27497,BOOKMAN," Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries. Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella.",22
27498,JERRY," Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.",22
27499,BOOKMAN," You're a comedian, you make people laugh.",22
27500,JERRY, I try.,22
27501,BOOKMAN," You think this is all a big joke, don't you?",22
27502,JERRY," No, I don't.",22
27503,BOOKMAN," I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're a celebrity that somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above the law?",22
27504,JERRY, Certainly not.,22
27505,BOOKMAN," Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says ""New York Public Library""? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot. Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before",22
27506,KRAMER, What's wrong?,22
27507,MARION, It's Bookman the library cop.,22
27508,KRAMER," So I, I didn't do anything wrong.",22
27509,MARION, I'm supposed to be at work. I could get fired. I shouldn't have come here.,22
27510,KRAMER, Why don't ya' leave?,22
27511,MARION, I can't.,22
27512,JERRY," No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it.  Becker, ... Becker, ...",22
27513,SHERRY," Kevin went to a public school, he's the 14 year old? We were gonna' send Marsha to a private school. Cause in some way they don't learn ... enough ... I think.",22
27514,JERRY," So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?",22
27515,SHERRY, I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Friday afternoon. I wore a purple dress.,22
27516,JERRY, Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?,22
27517,SHERRY, Positive. And I was chewin' Dentyne. I always chewed dentyne. Remember Jerry? Dentyne?,22
27518,JERRY, No Black Jack?,22
27519,SHERRY," Uch! Licorice gum? Never! We were ah, reading pasages to each other from that Henry Miller book,",22
27520,JERRY, Tropic of Cancer.,22
27521,SHERRY," No, Tropic of Capricorn",22
27522,JERRY, Tropic of Capricorn?,22
27523,SHERRY," Rememba? What holds the world togetha' ... ""As I have learned from bitter experience is sexual intercourse .""",22
27524,JERRY, Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.,22
27525,JERRY," George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.",22
27526,GEORGE," Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it",22
27527,JERRY," Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.",22
27528,SHERRY, Where ya' going?,22
27529,JERRY, It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go.  It was GEORGE!,22
27530,KRAMER, Read another poem.,22
27531,MARION, Pressed chest fleshed out west Might be the saviour or a garden pest.,22
27532,KRAMER," Wow, that is great. You should be published.",22
27533,KRAMER," You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.",22
27534,MARIAN," Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet. Listen to the echo",22
27535,KRAMER, HELLO!,22
27536,MARIAN, HELLO!,22
27537,KRAMER, HELLO!,22
27538,MARIAN, HELLO!,22
27539,BOOKMAN , Hello!,22
27540,MARIAN , Mr. Bookman.,22
27541,BOOKMAN, I remember when the librarian was a much older woman,22
27542,ELAINE, Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good,22
27543,JERRY, Maybe you're getting' a raise.,22
27544,ELAINE, Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.,22
27545,ELAINE, What?,22
27546,GEORGE, It's George,22
27547,ELAINE, George is on his way up.,22
27548,JERRY, Wait 'til I tell him about the book.,22
27549,KRAMER,  sobs,22
27550,ELAINE, Are you OK? What? What?,22
27551,KRAMER, It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it ,22
27552,ELAINE, Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT,22
27553,JERRY, I'm right here.,22
27554,ELAINE, Remember that Columbus book?,22
27555,JERRY," Columbus, Euro trash.",22
27556,GEORGE," Well, it's definetly him.",22
27557,ELAINE, Him? Him who?,22
27558,GEORGE, Him who? Hayman him.,22
27559,ELAINE, Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?,22
27560,GEORGE," Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus",22
27561,JERRY, That was double overtime.,22
27562,GEORGE," So I said, ""Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... "" He doesn't move. So I said uh, ""Can't stand ya'"", ""Can't stand ya'"" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.",22
27563,ELAINE, At least it wasn't atomic.,22
27564,GEORGE, It was.,22
27565,JERRY," So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER",22
27566,GEORGE, How should I know?,22
27567,JERRY, Because I gave it to you.,22
27568,GEORGE, Me?,22
27569,JERRY," Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.",22
27570,GEORGE, The locker room!,22
27571,JERRY, Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.,22
27572,GEORGE," Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.",22
27573,JERRY," All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.",22
27574,HEYMAN, Can't Stand Ya'.,22
27575,GEORGE, Yes Mr. Hayman.,22
27576,HEYMAN, Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.,22
27577,GEORGE, Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.,22
27578,HEYMAN," Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?",22
27579,GEORGE," I'm not really sure, I...",22
27580,HEYMAN, Well let's take a look.,22
27581,GEORGE,  No No No!,22
27582,JERRY," Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.",22
27583,BOOKMAN, Hard feelings? What do you know about hard feelings? Y'ever have a man die in your arms? Y'ever kill somebody?,22
27584,JERRY, What is your problem?,22
27585,BOOKMAN," What's my problem? Punks like you, that's my problem. And you better not screw up again Seinfeld, because if you do, I'll be all over you like a pitbull on a poodle.",22
27586,JERRY, That is one tough monkey!  So you were saying?,22
27587,ELAINE," Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.",22
27588,JERRY," Oh, beautiful did he like them?",22
27589,ELAINE," No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!",22
27590,JERRY,  Was he out there?,22
27591,GEORGE," Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.",22
27592,JERRY, I guess we'll never know.,22
27593,HEYMAN," Can't stand ya,  Can't stand ya. ",22
27594,JERRY," Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' ""Where's your jock strap?"" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.",22
27595,GEORGE, One left...what a joke.,23
27596,KRAMER, You can have this one.,23
27597,GEORGE," No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.",23
27598,ELAINE," Hey, I didn't get one either.",23
27599,JERRY, Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?,23
27600,ELAINE, This is what people do.,23
27601,JERRY, No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.,23
27602,GEORGE, You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.,23
27603,ELAINE, So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?,23
27604,GEORGE, Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.,23
27605,JERRY, Big accomplishment.,23
27606,GEORGE, Fish. What do they do?,23
27607,ELAINE, What do you do?,23
27608,KRAMER, It's this way.,23
27609,GEORGE, What time is it?,23
27610,JERRY, Five o'clock.,23
27611,GEORGE, Always late. Always late.,23
27612,JERRY, You're not late.,23
27613,GEORGE, I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.,23
27614,ELAINE, Who?,23
27615,GEORGE, My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?,23
27616,JERRY, Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.,23
27617,ELAINE, Isn't it going the other way?,23
27618,JERRY, There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.,23
27619,ELAINE, But it's Saturday.,23
27620,JERRY, You got the picnic and burger traffic.,23
27621,GEORGE, I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.,23
27622,ELAINE, What's the matter?,23
27623,JERRY, I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?,23
27624,JERRY,  You want me to help you with that?,23
27625,KRAMER," No, no, I got it.",23
27626,JERRY,"  What do you think, Georgie boy?",23
27627,GEORGE," Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.",23
27628,KRAMER," If you like her, go talk to her.",23
27629,GEORGE," Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, ""Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?"" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.",23
27630,KRAMER, She's fat.,23
27631,ELAINE, Oh she's fat?,23
27632,ELAINE, What? JERRY Where's the car?,23
27633,KRAMER, I thought it was here.,23
27634,GEORGE, You don't know where we parked?,23
27635,GEORGE," Oh, this is great.",23
27636,KRAMER, Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.,23
27637,JERRY, I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.,23
27638,ELAINE, I didn't pay attention.,23
27639,GEORGE, This is just what I need.,23
27640,ELAINE, I'm sure it's right around here.,23
27641,KRAMER, It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.,23
27642,GEORGE, There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.,23
27643,JERRY, It's over there. I know where it is.,23
27644,ELAINE," It's black, right?",23
27645,KRAMER, Dark blue.,23
27646,GEORGE,"  You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?",23
27647,JERRY," There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.",23
27648,JERRY,  Hmmm...I thought it was...,23
27649,KRAMER, Didn't we come in over there?,23
27650,JERRY, I thought it was over there.,23
27651,ELAINE, How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?,23
27652,KRAMER, About two hours.,23
27653,ELAINE,  You'd better find this car.,23
27654,GEORGE," It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF",23
27655,JERRY, I really have to go to the bathroom.,23
27656,KRAMER, Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J,23
27657,KRAMER,  Why? Nobody's around.,23
27658,JERRY, I'll wait.,23
27659,KRAMER, You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.,23
27660,JERRY, Alright.,23
27661,KRAMER," Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?",23
27662,JERRY, Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.,23
27663,ELAINE,  There it is!...No that's not it.,23
27664,ELAINE,"  Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.",23
27665,GEORGE, ...Six wrong?,23
27666,ELAINE, Those school zones are a killer.,23
27667,JERRY,  Will you let me help you with that?,23
27668,KRAMER, I'm gonna put it down behind that car.,23
27669,JERRY, You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?,23
27670,KRAMER,  Pink eleven. Remember that.,23
27671,GEORGE," Oh I got it.  That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.",23
27672,ELAINE,  I think they're laboring.,23
27673,KRAMER, Look at this place. It's huge...,23
27674,GEORGE," I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.",23
27675,JERRY," Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, ""Make sure you hang on to your jacket.""",23
27676,GEORGE," Where the hell is this car, Kramer?",23
27677,KRAMER, It's got to be here.,23
27678,ELAINE, Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.,23
27679,JERRY, Maybe it's not on this level.,23
27680,GEORGE, What?,23
27681,JERRY, There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?,23
27682,ELAINE, It felt like a couple of levels.,23
27683,JERRY, You should always carry a pad and pen.,23
27684,GEORGE, I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.,23
27685,KRAMER, I have a pen.,23
27686,JERRY," Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, ""Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms.""",23
27687,MOTHER,  Don't you dare talk to me like that! You hear me?,23
27688,ELAINE, Look at that woman.,23
27689,MOTHER, I told you! I don't care! You'll have to wait.,23
27690,GEORGE,"  Hey, is that necessary?",23
27691,MOTHER,  Why don't you mind your own business?,23
27692,GEORGE, I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.,23
27693,KID,  You're ugly.,23
27694,GEORGE, ...What?,23
27695,KID, You're ugly.,23
27696,GEORGE, You are!,23
27697,KID, You are!,23
27698,GEORGE, I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.,23
27699,KRAMER,  I found it!,23
27700,ELAINE, He's got it.,23
27701,KRAMER, Oh...no.,23
27702,JERRY," All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?",23
27703,ELAINE," Jerry, look at my fish.",23
27704,JERRY, His eyes look a little cloudy.,23
27705,GEORGE, Oh are they gonna be furious.,23
27706,JERRY, Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do.  I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!,23
27707,KRAMER, It was easy the last time.,23
27708,ELAINE, My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.,23
27709,JERRY, No one's going to do that.,23
27710,ELAINE," Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.",23
27711,ELAINE, Five minutes.,23
27712,ELAINE, We're not wilding.,23
27713,ELAINE,  Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...,23
27714,ELAINE,  Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny,23
27715,JERRY, Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?,23
27716,KRAMER, Right here at the mall.,23
27717,ELAINE, Excuse me...,23
27718,ELAINE,"  Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.",23
27719,JERRY, It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.,23
27720,KRAMER, You drank a whole bottle of water.,23
27721,JERRY, I know.,23
27722,KRAMER, So why don't you just go?,23
27723,JERRY, No I can't.,23
27724,KRAMER, Don't you get tired of following rules?,23
27725,JERRY, You think I'm too cautious?,23
27726,KRAMER, Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.,23
27727,JERRY, Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.,23
27728,KRAMER, Buddy Hackett?,23
27729,JERRY, He's a comedian.,23
27730,KRAMER, I know.,23
27731,JERRY, All right. All right.,23
27732,KRAMER,  You can go over here.,23
27733,JERRY, I can manage.,23
27734,KRAMER,  George! ,23
27735,KRAMER, It'll take you ten seconds.,23
27736,JERRY," Okay, okay. I'll be right back.",23
27737,SECURITY GUARD," Okay, let's go. Come with me.",23
27738,JERRY, But...,23
27739,SECURITY GUARD, Come on.,23
27740,JERRY,  ...Kramer,23
27741,JERRY," I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.",23
27742,SECURITY GUARD, Well you're still not allowed.,23
27743,JERRY," Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?",23
27744,SECURITY GUARD, That's up to you.,23
27745,JERRY, So you don't care if I die.,23
27746,SECURITY GUARD, What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility.,23
27747,JERRY, It was life and death.,23
27748,SECURITY GUARD, Uh huh.,23
27749,JERRY, Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.,23
27750,SECURITY GUARD, I don't know.,23
27751,JERRY," Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.",23
27752,JERRY,"  Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.",23
27753,SECURITY GUARD, You can tell the police all about it.,23
27754,KRAMER,  Jerry!,23
27755,ELAINE, Jerry!,23
27756,GEORGE," Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.",23
27757,ELAINE, Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.,23
27758,GEORGE, Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.,23
27759,GEORGE," If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.",23
27760,ELAINE," No, no, I'll be back.",23
27761,GEORGE, Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.,23
27762,KRAMER, Does that bother you?,23
27763,GEORGE," Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?",23
27764,KRAMER, Not at all.,23
27765,GEORGE," See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?",23
27766,KRAMER, I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.,23
27767,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?",23
27768,JERRY, First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.,23
27769,SECURITY GUARD, I know what you did.,23
27770,JERRY," Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.",23
27771,JERRY,  And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.,23
27772,SECURITY GUARD, Yeah I'm sure.,23
27773,JERRY, You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.,23
27774,ELAINE," And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.",23
27775,ELAINE, But why? Why can't you do it?,23
27776,ELAINE," No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.",23
27777,ELAINE, But why? Why don't you want to?,23
27778,ELAINE, But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?,23
27779,JERRY,"  All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.",23
27780,JERRY,"  What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.",23
27781,KRAMER, The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.,23
27782,GEORGE,  Really.,23
27783,KRAMER, What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?,23
27784,GEORGE, Who's Killer Kowalski?,23
27785,KRAMER, He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.,23
27786,GEORGE, I've gotta go to the bathroom.,23
27787,KRAMER, So go. GEORGE Here?,23
27788,KRAMER,  You and Jerry.,23
27789,GEORGE, Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...,23
27790,SECURITY GUARD, Oh your folks have an anniversary today too?,23
27791,JERRY,  Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?,23
27792,GEORGE,  A Red Chinese prison?,23
27793,KRAMER, George! George!,23
27794,ELAINE, Jerry! ,23
27795,JERRY," Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.",23
27796,JERRY," Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.",23
27797,ELAINE,  Jerry! JERRY Elaine?!,23
27798,ELAINE,  Jerry! Over here...,23
27799,ELAINE,  Where have you been?,23
27800,JERRY, I was arrested for urinating.,23
27801,GEORGE,  Me too.,23
27802,ELAINE, You what?,23
27803,JERRY, I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.,23
27804,ELAINE, Look at my fish...  Is he...,23
27805,JERRY," No, but he's not looking good... ",23
27806,ELAINE,"  Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.",23
27807,ELAINE," I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?",23
27808,ELAINE," That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.",23
27809,ELAINE,  That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?,23
27810,GEORGE," Elaine, shut-up.",23
27811,JERRY," Hey, where's Kramer?",23
27812,GEORGE, I don't know.  Where's Kramer?,23
27813,ELAINE, I thought he was with you.,23
27814,GEORGE," See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...",23
27815,GEORGE,"  Look at the time, that's it.",23
27816,ELAINE, Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?,23
27817,GEORGE, We came in over there!,23
27818,ELAINE, We didn't come in over there!,23
27819,JERRY, Where's Kramer?,23
27820,JERRY," Hey George, there she is again. ...",23
27821,GEORGE, So what do you want me to do?,23
27822,JERRY, Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.,23
27823,GEORGE, That is an opening.,23
27824,GEORGE,"  Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...",23
27825,AMY," Oh sure, I'll drive you around.",23
27826,GEORGE, You will?,23
27827,AMY, Sure.,23
27828,GEORGE, Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.,23
27829,AMY, I wouldn't want to get lost in here. It smells like a toilet. People are such animals.,23
27830,GEORGE," Yeah, right.",23
27831,JERRY, Filthy pigs.,23
27832,GEORGE, It's a blue Honda...,23
27833,AMY, This has happened to me too. It's very frustrating.,23
27834,ELAINE," Hi, I'm Elaine.",23
27835,JERRY, Jerry.,23
27836,AMY, Hello.,23
27837,ELAINE, It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.,23
27838,AMY, I'm happy to do it.  I'm Amy.,23
27839,GEORGE," Hi Amy, I'm George.",23
27840,GEORGE,  I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...,23
27841,GEORGE,  ...with that group.,23
27842,ELAINE,  What about my fish?,23
27843,JERRY," Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.",23
27844,ELAINE, I'll say.,23
27845,ELAINE, What is it?  The car!,23
27846,JERRY, The car!,23
27847,GEORGE, The car!,23
27848,ELAINE, We found it. I can't believe it!,23
27849,GEORGE," Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen.  Kramer! Kramer!",23
27850,JERRY, Kramer!,23
27851,JERRY, Kramer.,23
27852,KRAMER, Jerry?,23
27853,JERRY," Yeah, over here.",23
27854,KRAMER, Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?,23
27855,GEORGE, Purple 23.,23
27856,KRAMER, Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.,23
27857,GEORGE, Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.,23
27858,KRAMER, What time is it?,23
27859,GEORGE, Seven forty-five.,23
27860,KRAMER, Well at least there's no traffic.,23
27861,GEORGE, Right.,23
27862,KRAMER, What time does that play start?,23
27863,GEORGE, Eight o'clock.,23
27864,KRAMER, That might be a problem.  Where's your little bag of...,23
27865,KRAMER,  Oh... Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?,23
27866,GEORGE," She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't nice.",24
27867,JERRY," This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.",24
27868,GEORGE," Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?",24
27869,JERRY, What's that smell? What are you wearing?,24
27870,GEORGE," What, a 'little' cologne.",24
27871,JERRY, Manly.,24
27872,GEORGE, Monica wants me to wear it.,24
27873,JERRY, So why didn't you say no?,24
27874,GEORGE, I'm too nice.,24
27875,JERRY, Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.,24
27876,GEORGE, She wants me to take an IQ test.,24
27877,JERRY, That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.,24
27878,GEORGE," No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.",24
27879,JERRY," I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.",24
27880,GEORGE," You know, I can't talk to you anymore.",24
27881,JERRY," All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.",24
27882,GEORGE," Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.",24
27883,JERRY, Who thinks you're smart?,24
27884,GEORGE, I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.,24

27886,GEORGE, You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!,24
27887,JERRY," Oh, Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.",24

27901,JERRY," He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.",24
27902,ELAINE, Why do you keep watching?,24
27903,JERRY," I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for  survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for  him for a second.",24
27904,ELAINE, And then you flush.,24
27905,JERRY," Well, it's a spider.",24
27906,ELAINE," You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.",24
27907,ELAINE," Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.",24
27908,JERRY, Bazooka Joe.,24

27917,JERRY," Come on, Go in, go in!  [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]",24

27923,ELAINE," Sure, fine.",24
27924,JERRY, Casus belli.,24
27925,ELAINE, Casus belli.,24
27926,GEORGE, What's that?,24
27927,ELAINE, Since when do you wear cologne?,24

27933,JERRY," Oh, it's nothing...",24
27934,GEORGE, Is it about me?,24
27935,JERRY, Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be?  Why can't you live?,24
27936,ELAINE," It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?",24
27937,JERRY, This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.,24
27938,ELAINE," Oh, that sounds like fun.",24
27939,GEORGE," Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.",24
27940,ELAINE," You'll do well, you're smart.",24
27941,JERRY," No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.",24
27942,ELAINE, Wha'd you get on your SAT's?,24

27956,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?",24
27957,ELAINE, What?,24
27958,GEORGE," You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.",24
27959,ELAINE, Are you serious?,24
27960,GEORGE, Why not?,24
27961,ELAINE, Where would I take the test?,24
27962,GEORGE," I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.",24
27963,ELAINE," No, that'd be too noisy.",24
27964,JERRY," Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.",24
27965,ELAINE," Hey, what do you think?",24
27966,JERRY," Hey, I love a good caper.",24

27982,BABU," You're very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind...",24
27983,JERRY,"  Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?													 													 ",24
27984,GEORGE, You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.,24
27985,MONICA, But why?,24
27986,GEORGE," I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.",24
27987,MONICA," Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything.",24
27988,GEORGE, Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.,24
27989,MONICA," Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it.",24
27990,GEORGE," Well, I think you're wrong about that.  [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.",24
27991,MONICA, Good luck.,24

28019,KRAMER," Well, I'm not giving it back.",24
28020,JERRY, Why not?,24

28075,BABU," Of course, you're very smart man, I listen.",24
28076,JERRY," I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.",24
28077,BABU, But there are no Pakistani people here.,24
28078,JERRY, Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.,24
28079,BABU," Yes, you see everything, don't you?",24
28080,JERRY," Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.",24

28504,GEORGE, He..He threatened me.,25
28505,JERRY, Where did you come up with all that stuff?,25
28506,ELAINE, That was nothing.,25
28507,GEORGE, Elaine.. I have to tell you something...,25
28508,JERRY, George NO!!,25
28509,GEORGE, No no no no no no no..,25
28510,JERRY, George I'm telling ya..,25
28511,ELAINE, What is it?,25
28512,GEORGE, I'm very attracted to you..,25
28513,JERRY, Aye......,25
28514,KRAMER," I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes  Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.",25
28515,GEORGE, Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...,25
28516,KRAMER, Whoa!!!....That was you?,25
28517,ELAINE, It was a joke...,25
28518,KRAMER," Wait.. Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.",25
28519,ELAINE, Aah....  I think I'll get going...,25
28520,GEORGE, Heuh. huh. Stick around a while.,25
28521,JERRY, It's early.,25
28522,KRAMER, We'll order Chinese.,25
28523,GEORGE, Where'd you meet her?,26
28524,JERRY, I met her on an elevator.,26
28525,GEORGE, On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?,26
28526,JERRY," Impossible, right?",26
28527,GEORGE, You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?,26
28528,JERRY," I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.",26
28529,GEORGE, Wow. What'd you say?,26
28530,JERRY," You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.",26
28531,GEORGE, Wow.,26
28532,JERRY, Can you believe I did that?,26
28533,GEORGE, What did she say?,26
28534,ISABEL, What crop circles?,26
28535,JERRY, Not a good sign.,26
28536,GEORGE, Not everybody knows what the crop circles are.  Do you know what the crop circles are?,26
28537,NEWSSTAND OWNER, Crop circles? Why don't you buy something?,26
28538,JERRY, You got something in your teeth there.,26
28539,GEORGE, What?,26
28540,JERRY, It's green.,26
28541,GEORGE," Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.",26
28542,JERRY, Did you bump into anybody you knew?,26
28543,GEORGE, I had a job interview.,26
28544,JERRY, How'd it go?,26
28545,GEORGE, Take a guess.,26
28546,INTERVIEWER," Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing available at the present time, but should anything open up, we'll be in touch.",26
28547,GEORGE," Ok, thanks.",26
28548,JERRY," What do you need a job, you got Audrey.",26
28549,GEORGE," Yeah, right.",26
28550,JERRY, What's the matter?,26
28551,GEORGE," Oh, nothing.",26
28552,JERRY, What?,26
28553,GEORGE, You won't think I'm a bad person?,26
28554,JERRY, Too late for that.,26
28555,GEORGE," 'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.",26
28556,JERRY," Yeah, she's got a big nose.",26
28557,GEORGE," I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.",26
28558,JERRY, It's a schnoz.,26
28559,GEORGE," Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.",26
28560,JERRY, A little.,26
28561,GEORGE," So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.",26
28562,JERRY, Stop being so concerned with looks.,26
28563,JERRY, Have you said anything to her about it?,26
28564,GEORGE," I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.",26
28565,JERRY," Alright, shut up, here they come.",26
28566,GEORGE,  How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.,26
28567,KRAMER," So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.",26
28568,ELAINE, Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?,26
28569,KRAMER," No no, he's never met her. She's in California.",26
28570,ELAINE, Are you coming with me?,26
28571,KRAMER," Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fiancé, Peter Von Nostrand.",26
28572,GEORGE, Why don't you just commit yourself already?,26
28573,AUDREY, What is so special about this jacket?,26
28574,ELAINE, He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.,26
28575,AUDREY, What's the smudge on your hand?,26
28576,KRAMER," Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.",26
28577,GEORGE," What, you didn't wash all day?",26
28578,KRAMER," Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.",26
28579,AUDREY, It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating.,26
28580,KRAMER," Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.",26
28581,ELAINE, Kramer!,26
28582,KRAMER, What? What?,26
28583,ELAINE, How could you say something like that?!,26
28584,KRAMER, What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.,26
28585,ELAINE," No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.",26
28586,AUDREY," No, it's ok.",26
28587,ELAINE, What did you have to say that for?,26
28588,KRAMER," Well, I was just trying to help out.",26
28589,ELAINE," Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.",26
28590,KRAMER, You see what happens when you try to be nice?,26
28591,AUDREY, Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about?,26
28592,GEORGE, Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?,26
28593,AUDREY, You look like you've got something on your mind.,26
28594,GEORGE," Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind.  So how about that Kramer, huh?",26
28595,AUDREY, How about him?,26
28596,GEORGE, They way he just says stuff.,26
28597,AUDREY, He sure does.,26
28598,GEORGE," Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.",26
28599,AUDREY," So, what did you think?",26
28600,GEORGE, About the pizza?,26
28601,AUDREY," No, about the nose job.",26
28602,GEORGE," Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?",26
28603,AUDREY," Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.",26
28604,GEORGE," Yeah.  Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.",26
28605,AUDREY," I know, they're good.",26
28606,GEORGE, Peter Jennings had one.,26
28607,AUDREY, Really?,26
28608,GEORGE," Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...",26
28609,AUDREY, Uh huh.,26
28610,GEORGE," It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.",26
28611,AUDREY, I hate the dentist.,26
28612,GEORGE, It's a cleaning.,26
28613,AUDREY, So you really think I should do this?,26
28614,GEORGE," If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this",26
28615,AUDREY," Well, maybe I should.",26
28616,GEORGE, What the hell.,26
28617,ELAINE,"  Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?",26
28618,GEORGE, Me? I didn't say anything.,26
28619,ELAINE, You encouraged her to get one.,26
28620,GEORGE, I didn't encourage. No encourage.,26
28621,ELAINE, Peter Jennings had one?,26
28622,GEORGE, It's possible.,26
28623,ELAINE," Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.",26
28624,AUDREY," No, George is right. I want to get one.",26
28625,ELAINE, I think it's a mistake.,26
28626,GEORGE," Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.",26
28627,GEORGE," I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.",26
28628,JERRY," Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.",26
28629,GEORGE,"  Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.",26
28630,JERRY, We have time.,26
28631,GEORGE," It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.",26
28632,JERRY, It is exciting.,26
28633,GEORGE," Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...",26
28634,JERRY," Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.",26
28635,GEORGE, You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.,26
28636,JERRY, Then what?,26
28637,GEORGE, He still wins but it's not a blowout.,26
28638,JERRY," She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.",26
28639,JERRY,"  I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.",26
28640,KRAMER,  I'm proud of you.,26
28641,JERRY," So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.",26
28642,GEORGE, Good for you.,26
28643,JERRY," I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.",26
28644,GEORGE, It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.,26
28645,JERRY, It's not like that at all.,26
28646,ELAINE, How do you even know the jacket is there?,26
28647,KRAMER," Well I don't, I'm guessing.",26
28648,GEORGE," Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,",26
28649,AUDREY, George?,26
28650,GEORGE, Yeah?,26
28651,AUDREY, Enough.,26
28652,JERRY," Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.",26
28653,ELAINE, Are you sure you want us here for this?,26
28654,AUDREY, Yes.,26
28655,JERRY, Shouldn't a doctor do it?,26
28656,AUDREY," No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.",26
28657,GEORGE," Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.",26
28658,ELAINE, It looks good.,26
28659,JERRY, Great job.,26
28660,KRAMER, You got butchered.,26
28661,JERRY, Let's put him over here.,26
28662,KRAMER,  Where are you going?,26
28663,AUDREY,  To the doctor!,26
28664,KRAMER," Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.",26
28665,ELAINE, How ya feeling?,26
28666,GEORGE, Too much salt in my diet.,26
28667,ELAINE, Can I get you anything?,26
28668,GEORGE," Nah, I'm good.",26
28669,ELAINE, You sure? Anything?,26
28670,GEORGE," Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?",26
28671,ELAINE," No, it didn't. No, it didn't.",26
28672,GEORGE," It's like, all dented.",26
28673,ELAINE, Seems to be.,26
28674,GEORGE," Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--",26
28675,ELAINE," Shut up, George.",26
28676,GEORGE, Shut up?,26
28677,ELAINE, Yeah.,26
28678,GEORGE, Interesting.,26
28679,JERRY," Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!",26
28680,KRAMER," I don't have it, I threw it out.",26
28681,JERRY," You're lying! You got it, I want that number!",26
28682,KRAMER," I told you, I threw it out.",26
28683,JERRY, Give it to me!,26
28684,KRAMER," You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.",26
28685,JERRY," Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.",26
28686,KRAMER," You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.",26
28687,JERRY," I was lying, give it to me!",26
28688,KRAMER," No, you told me not to!",26
28689,JERRY, I want that number!,26
28690,KRAMER," Alright!  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!",26
28691,AUDREY, The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here...,26
28692,GEORGE, Yeah.,26
28693,AUDREY, You see this perinasal sinus cavity?,26
28694,GEORGE," Oh, I got it.",26
28695,AUDREY, You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.,26
28696,GEORGE," Yeah, phew.",26
28697,AUDREY," So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?",26
28698,GEORGE, What?,26
28699,AUDREY, Remember we talked about taking a trip together?,26
28700,GEORGE, We did?,26
28701,AUDREY," Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?",26
28702,GEORGE, Hawaii?,26
28703,AUDREY," Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this.",26
28704,GEORGE,"  You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.",26
28705,AUDREY, I never heard that.,26
28706,GEORGE, Oh yeah. My friend lived there.,26
28707,AUDREY, We could go to the Caribbean.,26
28708,GEORGE," You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.",26
28709,AUDREY," George, I don't think this is working.",26
28710,ISABEL," Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed. I swear Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore.",26
28711,JERRY, I'm Nelson!,26
28712,ISABEL," That's not the line, Jerry.",26
28713,JERRY," Alright, alright, I'm sorry.  Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.",26
28714,ISABEL," I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go crazy thinking about you.",26
28715,JERRY," Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.",26
28716,ISABEL," Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly.",26
28717,JERRY, (to himself,26
28718,ELAINE, You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.,26
28719,KRAMER,"  Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?",26
28720,ELAINE, Yeah.,26
28721,KRAMER, Wait wait wait wait wait.  Here.,26
28722,ELAINE, What do I need this for?,26
28723,KRAMER, Because we're engaged.,26
28724,ELAINE, We're engaged?,26
28725,KRAMER, Um hm.,26
28726,ELAINE," Kramer, this is too big.",26
28727,KRAMER,  It's my mom's.,26
28728,LANDLORD, Hello?,26
28729,ELAINE," Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.",26
28730,LANDLORD," Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you.  And you must be Professor Von Nostrand?",26
28731,KRAMER," Yes, yes I am.",26
28732,LANDLORD," I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it.",26
28733,KRAMER," Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.",26
28734,LANDLORD," Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?",26
28735,KRAMER, My contention?,26
28736,LANDLORD," Yes, your contention.",26
28737,KRAMER," Yes, that's my contention.",26
28738,ELAINE, I heard him contend that.,26
28739,LANDLORD, It's too bad about your father.,26
28740,ELAINE," Oh, it was a frame-up.",26
28741,LANDLORD," A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work you're doing.",26
28742,ELAINE," Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.",26
28743,KRAMER, She does fine work.,26
28744,LANDLORD," Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closet's this way.",26
28745,ELAINE, How kind of you.,26
28746,LANDLORD," You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe.",26
28747,ISABEL," Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part of you.",26
28748,JERRY," Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.",26
28749,ELAINE, Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.,26
28750,LANDLORD, He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite popular with the ladies.,26
28751,ELAINE," My father, really? I had no idea.",26
28752,LANDLORD," Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, came around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. Could have been your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! That's it, Babs",26
28753,KRAMER, You don't say?,26
28754,ELAINE, I found it!,26
28755,LANDLORD," The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees, screaming down the hall, ""Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape, and bring back that box of Danish!""",26
28756,KRAMER, So I grabbed the guy by the collar.,26
28757,ELAINE," Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!""",26
28758,JERRY, So I assume the jig was up.,26
28759,ELAINE," Yeah, pretty much.",26
28760,AUDREY, Hi.,26
28761,ELAINE, Hi!,26
28762,JERRY, Hey.,26
28763,AUDREY,  Hello.,26
28764,GEORGE,"  Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!",26
28765,AUDREY,"  Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.",26
28766,ELAINE," So, will I see you later tonight?",26
28767,AUDREY, Not sure.,26
28768,KRAMER,"  Well, I'll check you guys out later.  Ready?",26
28769,AUDREY,  I didn't wash.,26
28770,KRAMER, Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.,26
28771,ELAINE,  Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--,26
28772,GEORGE,  Elaine. Shut up.,26
28773,JERRY,  How did you get fleas?,27
28774,GEORGE,  Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.,27
28775,JERRY,  Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.,27
28776,GEORGE,"  That's not funny.  So, are you coming to the party?",27
28777,JERRY,"  I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation.  The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, ""You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?""",27
28778,GEORGE,  You know Ava's gonna be there.,27
28779,JERRY,  Who?,27
28780,GEORGE,  The nice one that works in my office.,27
28781,JERRY,  Nah.,27
28782,GEORGE,  I'll drive.,27
28783,JERRY,"  Oh, well, now you're talking.",27
28784,GEORGE,  It's supposed to be a good party.,27
28785,JERRY,"  What does that mean, good dip?",27
28786,GEORGE,"  No, there'll be girls there.",27
28787,JERRY,"  There's girls everywhere.  I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator.  They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?",27
28788,GEORGE,  There's a hundred different things here.  What's the difference between these two?    You got propylparabin?,27
28789,JERRY,  Got it.,27
28790,GEORGE,  You got isobutane-30?,27

28799,JERRY,  White Plains.,27
28800,JERRY,"  Girls.  There's girls right here in the store.  Look, look, there's one over there.  Look, there's another one.  Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there.  What's the matter?",27
28801,GEORGE,"  I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.",27
28802,JERRY,"  Are you sure?  Oh boy, here we go.",27
28803,GEORGE,"   Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.",27
28804,CASHIER,  You gave me a ten.,27
28805,GEORGE,  I'm positive I gave you a twenty.,27
28806,CASHIER,  I know what you gave me.,27
28807,GEORGE,  You owe me ten dollars.,27
28808,CASHIER,  Will you please step aside?  Next?,27
28809,GEORGE,"  Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second.  Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake?  Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there?  Or you--",27
28810,CASHIER,  You.,27
28811,GEORGE,"  No, no, no, see you're not really listening.",27
28812,SECURITY GUARD,  What's the problem here?,27
28813,GEORGE,"  No problem.  There's no problem.  She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.",27
28814,CASHIER,  He's claiming short.,27
28815,SECURITY GUARD,"  Alright, let's just take it outside.",27
28816,GEORGE,"  Oh, so you don't believe me either?",27
28817,SECURITY GUARD,"  Come on, let's go.",27
28818,GEORGE,"  You haven't won.  You may think you've won, but you haven't won.  Do you know why?  It's not over.  This is not over.  I'm not forgetting what's happening here.  You have my ten dollars.  I will get it back.  Alright, don't worry.  It's not over.  I'm going now.  Good bye.  I will be back.",27
28819,ELAINE,"  Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.",27
28820,JERRY,"  No, let's survey first.  Camp here.",27
28821,GEORGE, (waving,27
28822,JERRY,"  What could possess anyone to throw a party?  I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.",27
28823,AVA,"  So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st.",27
28824,GEORGE,"  Oh no you didn't.  Get out, when?",27
28825,AVA,  Yesterday,27
28826,GEORGE,  I don't believe it.,27
28827,AVA,  Ask Mark.,27
28828,GEORGE,"  Mark, is this true?",27
28829,JERRY,"  Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.",27
28830,ELAINE,"  How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.",27
28831,JERRY,"  Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight.  In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.",27
28832,ELAINE,  How old are you?,27
28833,JERRY,"  Thirty-six.  What's the signal?  Howbout this?  Chicken wing?  No, no, no, I got a better one.  Head patting.",27
28834,ELAINE,  Whatever you want.,27
28835,GUY,  You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?,27
28836,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah I did.",27
28837,GUY,  So what do you do?,27
28838,JERRY, (Patting his head,27
28839,GUY,  Are you?  Lemme ask you something.  Where do you get your material?,27
28840,JERRY,   I hear a voice.,27
28841,GUY,  What kind of voice?,27
28842,JERRY,"  A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.",27
28843,GUY,  How come you keep tapping your head.,27
28844,JERRY,  It's a nervous tic.  I'm on L-Dopa.,27
28845,GUY,"  On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver.  The man devoted his whole life to the peanut.  Imagine having so much passion for something.",27
28846,GUY,"  Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy.",27
28847,GUY,  I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.,27
28848,ELAINE,"  Yeah, me too.",27
28849,GUY,"  Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume.",27
28850,GEORGE,  How's it going?,27
28851,JERRY,"  Great, how about you?",27
28852,GEORGE,"  I can't believe what's happening here.  She hasn't taken her hands off me all night.  She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.",27
28853,JERRY,  How do you account for this?,27
28854,GEORGE,"  I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.",27
28855,JERRY,"  Well, she obviously liked you all along.",27
28856,GEORGE,"  No, I would have picked up on it.  I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know.  With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them.  If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, ""Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him.""",27
28857,JERRY,"  Anyway, I'm ready to go.",27
28858,GEORGE,  Now?,27
28859,JERRY,"  If not now, when?",27
28860,GEORGE,  Gimme a half-hour.,27
28861,JERRY,"  Okay, half-hour.",27
28862,GUY,"  Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil...",27
28863,JERRY,   Can I talk to you for a second?,27
28864,ELAINE,"  Oh, excuse me.    What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless.  People think I'm a mental patient.",27
28865,JERRY,"  Hey, I was dying over there.",27
28866,ELAINE,  This guy's going off on the peanut.  Now pay attention.,27
28867,ELLEN,"  Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club.  You talk about a lot of everyday things, right?",27
28868,JERRY,  Right.,27
28869,ELLEN,"  Yeah, I remember you.",27
28870,WOMAN,  I wonder what happened to my fiancé.  I know he's here somewhere. Ellen?  Have you seen my fiancé?,27
28871,ELLEN,  He's upstairs.,27
28872,WOMAN,"  Are you going upstairs?  Tell my fiancé I'm looking for him.  I havelost my fiancé, the poor baby.",27
28873,ELAINE,  Maybe the dingo ate your baby.,27
28874,WOMAN,  What?,27
28875,ELAINE,  The dingo ate your baby!,27
28876,JERRY,  You ready?,27
28877,GEORGE,"  Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.",27
28878,JERRY,  I do favors.,27
28879,GEORGE,  I think something's happening here.,27
28880,JERRY,  What?,27
28881,GEORGE,  I think she wants me to take her home.,27
28882,JERRY,  Wow.,27
28883,GEORGE,  What should I do?,27
28884,JERRY,  Go!  What could you do?,27
28885,GEORGE,  What about you and Elaine?,27
28886,JERRY,  We'll get a ride.,27
28887,GEORGE,  Are you sure?,27
28888,JERRY,"  We'll be fine, what did she say?",27
28889,GEORGE,  She told me she wants--   She told me she wants me to make love to her.,27
28890,JERRY,  What?  She said that?,27
28891,GEORGE,  Yeah.,27
28892,JERRY,  Get out of here.,27
28893,GEORGE,  I swear.,27
28894,JERRY,  What did you say?,27
28895,GEORGE,"  I, I, I can't.",27
28896,JERRY,  What did you say?,27
28897,GEORGE,"  Please, it's--",27
28898,JERRY,  What?,27
28899,GEORGE,  I... I... I long for you.,27
28900,JERRY,  I long for you?,27
28901,GEORGE,  I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.,27
28902,JERRY,"  It's okay, that's not bad.",27
28903,GEORGE,"  I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.",27
28904,JERRY,  Really?,27
28905,GEORGE,"  That's a lot of pressure.  Make love to me.  What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?",27
28906,JERRY,"  Oh, come on.",27
28907,GEORGE,"  I can't perform under pressure.  That's why I never play anything for money, I choke.  I could choke tonight.  And she works in my office, can you imagine?  She goes around telling everyone what happened?  Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.",27
28908,JERRY,"  George, you're thinking too much.",27
28909,GEORGE,"  I know, I know, I can't stop it!",27
28910,ELAINE,"  Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.",27
28911,JERRY,   Pendant?  Those bastards.,27
28912,ELAINE,  Excuse me.,27
28913,JERRY,"  Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office",27
28914,ELAINE,  Really?  Huh.  What a world.  So we can go now?,27
28915,JERRY,"  Uh, no, he's taking the car.",27
28916,ELAINE,"  Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?",27
28917,JERRY,  I don't know.,27
28918,ELAINE,  You don't know?,27
28919,JERRY,  Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.,27
28920,ELAINE,"  Oh great, oh, this is great.  How could you let him take the car?",27
28921,JERRY,"  There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.",27
28922,ELAINE,   Oh look at that.  Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?,27
28923,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah, alright.",27
28924,ELAINE,  I can't believe she's walking around in that.,27
28925,JERRY,  Just don't make a scene.,27
28926,ELAINE,"  Hey, is that real fur?",27
28927,JERRY,  Oh boy.,27
28928,AVA,  It better be or my ex-husband owes me an explanation.,27
28929,GEORGE,"  Yeah, good night.",27
28930,ELAINE,  You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?,27
28931,GEORGE,  Could we talk about this some other time?,27
28932,AVA,  Are you a vegetarian?,27
28933,JERRY,  Here we go.,27
28934,ELAINE,"  Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.",27
28935,AVA,  So you're a hypocrite.,27
28936,GEORGE,"  Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect.  Anyway-",27
28937,AVA,"  Well, talk to me when you stop eating fish.",27
28938,ELAINE,  Fish don't feel any pain.,27
28939,AVA,  How do you know?  Do you communicate with fish?,27
28940,ELAINE,"  Well, they're not kept in little cages.",27
28941,AVA,  Ever seen a goldfish?,27
28942,GEORGE,  Goldfish.,27
28943,ELAINE,"  Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish.  They're not unhappy.",27
28944,AVA,"  Oh yeah, right.  Swim around in a bowl for two weeks and get flushed down the toilet, that's a good life.    Let's go.",27
28945,ELAINE,"  Oh yeah, that's right.  Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!",27
28946,GEORGE,  That's why we're here in America.,27
28947,JERRY,  You're beautiful.,27
28948,ELAINE,  Call Kramer.,27
28949,JERRY,"  Alright.   Excuse me, this is your party, right?",27
28950,STEVE,"  No, I just live here.",27
28951,JERRY,  Can I use your phone?,27
28952,STEVE,  What's in it for me?,27
28953,JERRY,  A bigger bill?,27
28954,STEVE,"  He he, go for it.",27
28955,JERRY,"  Krame?  Sein.  What are you doing?  Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island.  What are your thoughts about taking a ride?  You sure?  Okay, but don't leave me hanging here.  Okay, great.  Let me give you directions.",27
28956,ELAINE,  You sure you don't need any help?,27
28957,JENNY,"  No, not really.",27
28958,JERRY,  I'm sure he'll be here any minute.,27
28959,JENNY,   I want them out of here.,27
28960,ELAINE,  Call him again.,27
28961,JERRY,"  I called, what should I do?  We really appreciate this.",27
28962,JENNY,   It's two o'clock in the morning.,27
28963,JERRY,"   Oh, you got the Civil War book.  I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.",27
28964,ELAINE,  Six hundred and twenty million people died.,27
28965,JERRY,  Thousand.,27
28966,ELAINE,"  Thousand.  Six hundred and twenty thousand.  The horror, the horror.   The wife keeps giving us dirty looks.  Are you sure you gave him the right directions?",27
28967,JERRY,  Yes.    You're sure there's nothing we can do?,27
28968,JENNY,"  No!    I am not going to bed with them in our house, this is ridiculous.",27
28969,JERRY,  You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here.  Mike Wichter.  He sold plastic straws.  You know the ones?  You could bend them.,27
28970,ELAINE,"  Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.",27
28971,JENNY,"  You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming.",27
28972,JERRY,"  Oh, he's coming.",27
28973,JENNY,  Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.,27
28974,JERRY,  That's him.,27
28975,JENNY,  I'm going to bed!,27
28976,ELAINE,  Thanks a lot.,27
28977,JERRY,"  Thanks, great party.",27
28978,KRAMER,"  Hey, how ya doing?",27
28979,STEVE,"  Ah, look who's here.",27
28980,KRAMER,  I'm sorry.,27
28981,JERRY,"  Hey, it's okay.",27
28982,KRAMER,"  I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.",27
28983,ELAINE,  Then how did you find the place?,27
28984,KRAMER,"  Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive.  Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it.  8173.",27
28985,JERRY,"  Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.",27
28986,STEVE,  No problem.,27
28987,JERRY,"  And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.",27
28988,STEVE,"  Hey, I might take you up on that.",27
28989,JERRY,"   Here's my address and number.  And really, thanks again.",27
28990,KRAMER,   You better zip up.  I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.,27
28991,ELAINE,  But it's cold out.,27
28992,KRAMER,"  Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.",27
28993,JERRY,"  George, I've been sick all week.  Elaine was too.  Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes.  Do the math.  Yeah, maybe I will get out.  Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first.  Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something.  Yeah, Selwyn's.  Okay bye.",27
28994,JERRY,  Who is it?,27
28995,VOICE,  Mr. Pocatello.,27
28996,JERRY,  Who?,27
28997,VOICE,  You mean you don't recognize my voice?,27
28998,STEVE,"  Jerry, baby!",27
28999,JERRY,  Do I know you?,27
29000,STEVE,  Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.,27
29001,JERRY,"  I'm sorry, uh-",27
29002,STEVE,"  See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.",27
29003,JERRY,"  Oh, okay.",27
29004,STEVE,"  You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.",27
29005,JERRY,  You certainly are.  What's going on?,27
29006,STEVE,"  I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break.  I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business.",27
29007,JERRY,"  Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.",27
29008,STEVE,"  Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.",27
29009,JERRY,"  No, really, I just got off the phone with him.",27
29010,STEVE,  I understand.,27
29011,JERRY,"  Look, you can hang out here if you want.",27
29012,STEVE,  Don't be so enthusiastic.,27
29013,JERRY,"  No, it's-",27
29014,STEVE,  I'm not gonna steal anything.,27
29015,JERRY,"  No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.",27
29016,STEVE,  I think I can do that.,27
29017,JERRY,"  Really, I'm sorry.  Maybe another time.",27
29018,STEVE,  Yeah.  Let's have lunch.,27
29019,JERRY,"  They guy's in my house right now.  What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.",27
29020,GEORGE,"  Yeah, me either.",27
29021,JERRY,"  Oh, come on.",27
29022,GEORGE,  What come on?  Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?,27
29023,JERRY,  I've never had a job.,27
29024,GEORGE,"  You know the anxiety you feel on a date?  That's what I have every day now.  My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.",27
29025,JERRY,"  That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?",27
29026,GEORGE,"  Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend.  Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk.  I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing.  Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went.  If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day.  I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me.  I want to go back there again.'",27
29027,JERRY,  What are you gonna do?,27
29028,GEORGE,"  I have no choice, I'm quitting.",27
29029,KRAMER,"  The party, Long Island?",27
29030,STEVE,"  Kramer, right?",27
29031,KRAMER,"  Hey, what are you doing here?",27
29032,STEVE,  I'm waiting for my ride.,27
29033,KRAMER,  Where's Jerry?,27
29034,STEVE,"  He split.  Let me ask you something.  Is there anything to drink in here or is that, like, a stupid question?",27
29035,KRAMER,"  Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything.    Well, but I might have something.",27
29036,JERRY,"  Alright, I'm gonna get this.  This looks good.",27
29037,GEORGE,  How much is that?,27
29038,JERRY,  Nine sixty.,27
29039,GEORGE,  Nine sixty?  Give it to me.,27
29040,JERRY,  Why?,27
29041,GEORGE,"  Don't worry, I got it.",27
29042,JERRY,"  What do you mean, you got it?",27
29043,GEORGE,  I got it.,27
29044,JERRY,"  Since when are you treating me to medicine?  What are you doing?  You're stealing this, aren't you?",27
29045,GEORGE,  I'm not stealing it.  They owe me ten dollars.  They stole from me.,27
29046,JERRY,  You're a lunatic.,27
29047,GEORGE,"  I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.",27
29048,JERRY,  What do you say to a person like you?,27
29049,GEORGE,  Just walk.,27
29050,JERRY,  Oh.,27
29051,SECURITY GUARD,  Scuse me.  What do you got there?,27
29052,GEORGE,  What?,27
29053,SECURITY GUARD,  What do you got in your shirt?,27
29054,GEORGE,"  Oh, I was gonna pay for this.",27
29055,SECURITY GUARD,  Come with me.,27
29056,GEORGE,   Where are you taking me?  I was gonna pay for it.,27
29057,CASHIER, um-hmm.,27
29058,SECURITY GUARD,  You don't think I remember you?,27
29059,GEORGE,   What are you talking about?,27
29060,SECURITY GUARD,"  I know who you are, I was watching you.",27
29061,GEORGE,   What are you gonna do?  Are you gonna call the police?,27
29062,JERRY,  Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?,27
29063,KRAMER,"  So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown!  Well I followed the instructions!",27
29064,STEVE,"   Ah, they turned brown!!  Brown!!  So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?",27
29065,KRAMER,  Not really.,27
29066,STEVE,  Maybe we should call one of those escort services.  I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.,27
29067,KRAMER,   555-LOVE.,27
29068,STEVE,"  Hey, you want in on this?",27
29069,KRAMER,"  No, I got a girl in the next building",27

29099,GEORGE,  Where does he come off?,27
29100,JERRY,"  Yeah, I know.  There's no call for that kind of attitude.",27
29101,GEORGE,  One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.,27
29102,JERRY,"  Oh, we all hated him.",27
29103,JERRY, Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.,28
29104,GEORGE, Was the alarm on?,28
29105,JERRY," I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.",28
29106,GEORGE," I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?",28
29107,JERRY, They cross the wires or something.,28
29108,GEORGE, Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.,28
29109,JERRY, They stole my car.,28
29110,KRAMER, Who did?,28

29114,KRAMER, What are they gonna do?,28
29115,JERRY," I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.",28
29116,GEORGE, Maybe you should call your car phone.,28
29117,JERRY," Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.",28
29118,GEORGE," Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.",28

29149,JERRY," Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?",28
29150,CAR THIEF," I didn't cross any wires, the keys were in it.",28
29151,JERRY," Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.",28
29152,CAR THIEF," Jerry, when's the last time you had a tune-up? Because I can't find the--",28
29153,JERRY, Sid left the keys in the car.,28
29154,GEORGE, Who's Sid?,28
29155,JERRY," He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.",28
29156,GEORGE, What do you mean?,28
29157,JERRY, He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.,28
29158,GEORGE," What, do you pay him for that?",28
29159,JERRY," Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.",28
29160,GEORGE, How many people does he do that for?,28
29161,JERRY," The whole block, forty, fifty cars.",28
29162,KRAMER," He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?",28
29163,GEORGE, Could anybody do that?,28
29164,JERRY," Hey Sid, what happened?",28
29165,SID," I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff.",28
29166,JERRY, You left the keys in the car?,28
29167,SID," Well, you know they're making that Woody Allen movie in the block, and all those people and trucks everywhere, when I saw him I must have got a little distracted.",28
29168,KRAMER, You know I'm in that movie?,28
29169,GEORGE, You are?,28
29170,KRAMER," Yeah, I'm an extra.",28
29171,GEORGE, How'd you get that?,28
29172,KRAMER," Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.",28
29173,GEORGE, Right out of the clear blue sky?,28
29174,KRAMER, Clear blue sky!,28
29175,GEORGE," Well, why didn't they ask me?",28
29176,KRAMER, I got a quality.,28

29180,JERRY, This Wednesday?,28
29181,SID," No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday.",28
29182,JERRY, But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.,28
29183,SID," If I meant this Wednesday, I would have said this Wednesday. It's the week after this Wednesday.",28
29184,GEORGE," Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?",28
29185,SID," Whoever wants to move them, why do I care who moves them? They can move themselves if they want.",28
29186,GEORGE, Maybe I could move them until you get back.,28
29187,SID, What's a young man like you want to move cars for? You don't work?,28
29188,GEORGE, I'm in a transition phase right now.,28
29189,SID," Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars. Just don't forget to take the keys out, that's all.",28
29190,JERRY," Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.",28
29191,ELAINE," I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.",28
29192,JERRY," Owen March, I never heard of him.",28
29193,ELAINE," Well, he's not a baseball player.",28
29194,JERRY," Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.",28
29195,ELAINE," Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.",28
29196,JERRY, What's that?,28
29197,ELAINE, He's sixty-six years old.,28
29198,RENTAL CAR AGENT, Next please.,28
29199,ELAINE," Well, go, go.",28
29200,RENTAL CAR AGENT, Can I help you? Name please?,28
29201,JERRY," Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.",28
29202,RENTAL CAR AGENT," Okay, let's see here.",28
29203,JERRY, Sixty-six years old?,28
29204,ELAINE," Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.",28
29205,JERRY," Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?",28
29206,ELAINE," What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?",28
29207,JERRY," Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.",28
29208,RENTAL CAR AGENT," I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.",28
29209,JERRY," I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?",28
29210,RENTAL CAR AGENT," Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.",28
29211,JERRY, But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.,28
29212,RENTAL CAR AGENT, I know why we have reservations.,28
29213,JERRY," I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.",28
29214,RENTAL CAR AGENT," Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor.",28
29215,JERRY," Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?",28
29216,ELAINE, What?,28
29217,JERRY," Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.",28
29218,ELAINE," Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?",28
29219,JERRY, Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.,28
29220,ELAINE," Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.",28
29221,RENTAL CAR AGENT," I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's nothing we can do.",28
29222,JERRY," Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.",28
29223,RENTAL CAR AGENT, But we do have a compact if you would like that.,28
29224,JERRY, Fine.,28
29225,RENTAL CAR AGENT, Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort for you Mr. Seinfeld. Would you like insurance?,28
29226,JERRY," Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.",28
29227,RENTAL CAR AGENT, Please fill this out.,28
29228,ELAINE," What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?",28
29229,JERRY," Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.",28
29230,ELAINE," I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.",28
29231,ELAINE, I just don't enjoy being with him.,28
29232,JERRY, Well that's what's important.,28
29233,ELAINE," I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?",28
29234,JERRY, How many times you been out with him?,28
29235,ELAINE, Seven?,28
29236,JERRY, Face to face.,28
29237,ELAINE, Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?,28
29238,JERRY," If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.",28
29239,ELAINE, Hmm... How's the pasta over there?,28
29240,KRAMER," Whoa, whoa!!",28
29241,JERRY, What is going on out there?,28
29242,GEORGE," I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!",28
29243,KRAMER," Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?",28
29244,ELAINE, Today?!,28
29245,KRAMER, You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.,28
29246,ELAINE, Yeah.,28
29247,KRAMER," So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.",28
29248,ELAINE, He was laughing?!,28
29249,KRAMER," Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.",28
29250,JERRY, So then what?,28
29251,KRAMER, I got a line in the movie!,28
29252,ELAINE, Get out!,28
29253,JERRY, That's great!,28
29254,GEORGE, You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?,28
29255,KRAMER," Pretty good, huh?",28
29256,GEORGE, You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?,28
29257,KRAMER," Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?",28
29258,JERRY, You mean *a* career.,28
29259,ELAINE, So was Mia Farrow there?,28
29260,KRAMER," Uh, I didn't see him.",28
29261,ELAINE, What's your line?,28
29262,KRAMER," Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?",28
29263,KRAMER," So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, ""Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.""",28
29264,GEORGE, Is that how you're gonna say it?,28
29265,KRAMER," No, no, I'm working on it.",28
29266,ELAINE," Do it like this. ""These pretzels are making me thirsty.""",28
29267,JERRY," No. ""These pretzels are making me thirsty.""",28
29268,KRAMER," No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.",28
29269,GEORGE," ""These pretzels are making me thirsty!!""",28
29270,GEORGE, That was no good?,28
29271,KRAMER, I didn't say anything.,28
29272,ELAINE, I'm gonna go break up with Owen.,28
29273,GEORGE, What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living!  Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!,28
29274,JERRY, Oh my god.,28
29275,ELAINE, Call an ambulance.,28
29276,JERRY," Boy, he took it hard.",28
29277,ELAINE, We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.,28
29278,JERRY,"  Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.",28
29279,ELAINE, Tell then to hurry! Hurry!,28
29280,JERRY,  It's an ambulance.  I don't know but he's unconscious.,28
29281,KRAMER," These pretzels are making me thirsty.  Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.",28
29282,JERRY, Kramer.,28
29283,KRAMER, What happened here?,28
29284,ELAINE," I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?",28
29285,JERRY, Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?,28
29286,ELAINE, What extremities?,28
29287,KRAMER, What's an extremity?,28
29288,JERRY," You raise the feet, get blood to the head.",28
29289,KRAMER," You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.",28
29290,ELAINE," Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.",28
29291,JERRY, I don't have a washcloth.,28
29292,ELAINE, Well use a paper towel.,28
29293,JERRY, You can't put a paper towel on his head.,28
29294,KRAMER, What about a big sponge?,28
29295,JERRY, How you gonna hold it on there?,28
29296,KRAMER, Use a belt.,28
29297,ELAINE," No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.",28
29298,JERRY, Should we walk him around?,28
29299,KRAMER," Yeah, I've seen them do that.",28
29300,JERRY," No, no that's for a drug overdose.",28
29301,KRAMER, Maybe that's what he's got.,28
29302,ELAINE," No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.",28
29303,KRAMER, Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.,28
29304,ELAINE, He is not a drug addict!,28
29305,JERRY," Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.",28
29306,ELAINE, A cookie!,28
29307,KRAMER, Can you give him a cookie?,28
29308,ELAINE, How's he gonna chew it?,28
29309,JERRY," We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.",28
29310,ELAINE," Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.",28
29311,KRAMER, I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.,28
29312,ELAINE," You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.",28
29313,JERRY, Cookies don't liquefy.,28
29314,ELAINE," Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.",28
29315,KRAMER, Alright I'll get a blender.,28
29316,JERRY, What blender? I don't have a blender.,28
29317,KRAMER, You got a blender.,28
29318,JERRY, I would know if I had a blender.,28
29319,ELAINE, Where is the ambulance?!,28
29320,JERRY,"  Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.",28
29321,ELAINE, I can't believe what's going on out here.,28
29322,JERRY," This is an emergency, what's taking so long?  Wait a second, maybe that's them.  Hello?",28
29323,VOICE, Paramedics.,28
29324,JERRY," Come on up. Okay, they're here.",28
29325,ELAINE, He seems to be breathing.,28
29326,JERRY," Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.",28
29327,ELAINE, I know.,28
29328,JERRY," Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?",28
29329,ELAINE, Almost.,28
29330,JERRY," Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.",28
29331,ELAINE, It's not an easy thing to bring up.,28
29332,JERRY," Yeah, that's true.",28
29333,ELAINE," Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.",28
29334,JERRY, Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.,28
29335,ELAINE," He does, how'd you know that?",28
29336,JERRY, I could tell.,28
29337,ELAINE," What happened, what took you so long?!",28
29338,PARAMEDIC," We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldn't move, the whole intersection is gridlocked, I've never seen anything like it. So finally we make the turn and this guy who's running around triple-parking cars slammed into us with a blue Escort.",28
29339,JERRY, Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!,28
29340,GEORGE, Oh man.,28
29341,JERRY, What happened to the car?,28
29342,GEORGE," Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there!  Who's he?",28
29343,ELAINE, This guy I'm seeing.,28
29344,GEORGE, What happened?,28
29345,JERRY, We don't know!,28
29346,PARAMEDIC, Who put cookies in his mouth?,28
29347,PARAMEDIC, You're not supposed to do that.,28
29348,JERRY, So how'd you hit the car?,28
29349,GEORGE," I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.",28
29350,JERRY," It's not even my car, it's a rental.",28
29351,KRAMER," What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.",28
29352,GEORGE, Woody mentioned me? What did he say?,28
29353,KRAMER," He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'",28
29354,GEORGE, Should I apologize to Woody?,28
29355,KRAMER," Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.",28
29356,SID, Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have mentioned that.,28
29357,GEORGE, Well I know how to drive.,28
29358,SID, Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me.,28
29359,JERRY, Can I get anybody anything?,28
29360,SID, Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is who's putting your pants on?,28
29361,GEORGE," I put my pants on, Sid.",28
29362,SID," I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those cars.",28
29363,GEORGE, Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.,28
29364,SID, Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs surgery on his foot. Now he'll be walking around with a limp because you can't park a few cars.,28
29365,GEORGE, Maybe I could call my father.,28
29366,KRAMER," Hey, you seen the paper yet?",28
29367,JERRY," Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.",28
29368,KRAMER, Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.,28
29369,JERRY,"  Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.",28
29370,KRAMER," Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.",28
29371,JERRY,  The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.,28
29372,SID, Oh lord.,28
29373,JERRY,  The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.,28
29374,ELAINE," Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'",28
29375,JERRY, Can he communicate?,28
29376,ELAINE," Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.",28
29377,JERRY," Alright, she's free.  Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.",28
29378,ELAINE," So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.",28
29379,JERRY, What community? There's a community?,28
29380,ELAINE, Of course there's a community.,28
29381,JERRY," All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.",28
29382,RENTAL CAR AGENT, Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred and sixty-six dollars.,28
29383,JERRY," Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...",28
29384,RENTAL CAR AGENT," Yes, now, uh, in your report you said that you were not the driver of the car at the time of the accident.",28
29385,JERRY," That is right, somebody else was driving.",28
29386,RENTAL CAR AGENT," Alright, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving the car.",28
29387,JERRY," Uh huh, what's that?",28
29388,RENTAL CAR AGENT, You're not covered for other drivers.,28
29389,JERRY, Other drivers?,28
29390,RENTAL CAR AGENT, Um hm.,28
29391,JERRY," Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?",28
29392,RENTAL CAR AGENT, Not that particular one.,28
29393,JERRY," Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.",28
29394,RENTAL CAR AGENT," Sir, if you had read the rental agreement--",28
29395,JERRY," Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?",28
29396,RENTAL CAR AGENT," Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that.",28
29397,JERRY, These pretzels are making me thirsty.,28
29398,ELAINE," Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh?  Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean.  Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.",28
29399,ELAINE," Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?",28
29400,JERRY, An overdose of odor? Good question.,28
29401,GEORGE, Do I smell?,28
29402,ELAINE," No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.",28
29403,JERRY, Ahh.,28
29404,GEORGE, He's alright?,28
29405,ELAINE," Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.",28
29406,JERRY, Let me get that.,28
29407,GEORGE," No no no, I got it.",28
29408,JERRY, Please.,28
29409,GEORGE," No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,",28
29410,JERRY,"  Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.",28
29411,JERRY, What are you doing here?,28
29412,KRAMER, I got fired from the movie.,28
29413,GEORGE," Get out of here, why?",28
29414,KRAMER," Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.",28
29415,ELAINE, Aww.,28
29416,KRAMER," Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.",28
29417,JERRY," Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.",28
29418,JERRY," I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going ""I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?",29
29419,JERRY," Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.",29
29420,GEORGE, Like you do.,29
29421,JERRY, Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?,29
29422,GEORGE, What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?,29
29423,JERRY, I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?,29
29424,GEORGE, Why did France give that to us anyway?,29
29425,JERRY, It was a gift.,29
29426,GEORGE, So countries just exchange gifts like that?,29
29427,JERRY, If they like each other.,29
29428,GEORGE, There's Elaine.,29
29429,JERRY, See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.,29
29430,GEORGE, Really? They work here in the office?,29
29431,JERRY, Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.,29
29432,GEORGE, Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.,29
29433,JERRY, You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.,29
29434,GEORGE, Really?,29
29435,JERRY, Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.,29
29436,GEORGE," ""Off the wagon""?",29
29437,JERRY, I think it's off the wagon.,29
29438,GEORGE," I think it's ""on the wagon"".",29
29439,ELAINE," Jerry, George, what are you doing here?",29
29440,JERRY, What am I doing here? Ba-boom ,29
29441,ELAINE, *gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! ,29
29442,JERRY, Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.,29
29443,ELAINE, Where did you find it?,29
29444,JERRY, Under the sofa cushion.,29
29445,ELAINE, And you stopped by just to give it to me?,29
29446,JERRY, It's your Christmas present.,29
29447,ELAINE, I though I'd never find it.,29
29448,GEORGE, Well today's your lucky day.,29
29449,ELAINE, No. Today's *your* lucky day.,29
29450,GEORGE, It will be my first one.,29
29451,ELAINE, You want to work here?,29
29452,GEORGE, Huh?,29
29453,ELAINE," Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.",29
29454,DICK, Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy?,29
29455,JERRY," ""The guy?""",29
29456,ELAINE,  Dick.,29
29457,GEORGE, How can you just get it?,29
29458,ELAINE," My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.",29
29459,JERRY, Cranberry juice?,29
29460,ELAINE, And vodka.,29
29461,DICK, I got the cranberry juice.,29
29462,DICK, So... you're Jerry.,29
29463,JERRY, So... I'm Jerry. ,29
29464,MR. LIPPMAN,  So have you ever done this kind of work before?,29
29465,GEORGE," Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.",29
29466,MR. LIPPMAN, How do you read?,29
29467,GEORGE, I like Mike Lubika.,29
29468,MR. LIPPMAN, Mike Lubika?,29
29469,GEORGE, He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...,29
29470,MR. LIPPMAN," No, no, no. I mean authors.",29
29471,GEORGE, Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.,29
29472,MR. LIPPMAN, Name a couple.,29
29473,GEORGE," Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.",29
29474,MR. LIPPMAN, Art Vandelay?,29
29475,GEORGE," He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.",29
29476,MR. LIPPMAN, What has he written?,29
29477,GEORGE, Venetian Blinds.,29
29478,DICK,  I've got new for you. I'm funnier than you are.,29
29479,JERRY, Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.,29
29480,ELAINE, Where's my drink?,29
29481,JERRY," There.  So, how did it go?",29
29482,GEORGE, I think he was impressed.,29
29483,ELAINE," No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.",29
29484,JERRY," Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.",29
29485,ELAINE, Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.,29
29486,JERRY," I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.",29
29487,ELAINE, One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.,29
29488,GEORGE, Told you.,29
29489,JERRY, I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.,29
29490,GEORGE, Do I really have to buy her something?,29
29491,JERRY, Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?,29
29492,GEORGE, What is that? Is that cashmere?,29
29493,JERRY, Yeah. She would love cashmere.,29
29494,GEORGE, Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.,29
29495,JERRY, Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.,29
29496,GEORGE," Wow. Excuse me, Miss?",29
29497,SALES WOMAN, Yes?,29
29498,GEORGE, How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?,29
29499,SALES WOMAN,"  Oh, here. This is why.",29
29500,GEORGE, What? I don't see anything.,29
29501,SALES WOMAN, See this red dot?,29
29502,GEORGE, Oh yeah.,29
29503,JERRY, Oh it's damaged. ,29
29504,GEORGE,  Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?,29
29505,SALES WOMAN, There's no exchanges on this.,29
29506,GEORGE, You think she would care about the red dot?,29
29507,JERRY, It's hard to say.,29
29508,GEORGE, I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?,29
29509,JERRY, Well I can see it.,29
29510,GEORGE," Yeah, but you know where it is.",29
29511,JERRY, Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?,29
29512,GEORGE, Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?,29
29513,JERRY, It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.,29
29514,GEORGE, Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?,29
29515,JERRY, You want me to take an overview?,29
29516,GEORGE, Please.,29
29517,JERRY, I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.,29
29518,JERRY, Yeah so?,29
29519,ELAINE, He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.,29
29520,JERRY," Oh boy, can you smell it?",29
29521,ELAINE, No. I can't smell it.,29
29522,JERRY, Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.,29
29523,ELAINE, You don't always smell someone from a drink.,29
29524,JERRY, Yes you do.,29
29525,ELAINE, What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?,29
29526,JERRY, Yes you would.,29
29527,JERRY, I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?,29
29528,KRAMER, Okay.,29
29529,JERRY, Would you take a drink and let us smell you?,29
29530,KRAMER, You can smell me without the drink.,29
29531,ELAINE, I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.,29
29532,KRAMER," Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?",29
29533,JERRY, I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.,29
29534,KRAMER, All right.,29
29535,JERRY, I don't smell anything.,29
29536,ELAINE, Maybe we're too close to the bottle.,29
29537,JERRY, Yeah.,29
29538,GEORGE,  It's George.,29
29539,JERRY, Come on up.,29
29540,KRAMER," That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.",29
29541,GEORGE, Hello everybody.,29
29542,KRAMER," Hey.  I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.",29
29543,GEORGE,  Thank you.,29
29544,ELAINE, Hey what's that?,29
29545,GEORGE, It's an early Christmas present.,29
29546,ELAINE, Christmas present? For who?,29
29547,GEORGE, For you.,29
29548,ELAINE, *gasp*  Get out of here.,29
29549,KRAMER," Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret.  h-e-double n...",29
29550,JERRY, Kramer. Yeah that'll do.,29
29551,ELAINE,"  Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?",29
29552,GEORGE, Of course it's cashmere.,29
29553,ELAINE," Oh, I love cashmere.",29
29554,GEORGE, Well who doesn't.,29
29555,ELAINE," My, George this must have cost a fortune.",29
29556,GEORGE," Ahh, money.",29
29557,ELAINE," Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?",29
29558,JERRY, I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.,29
29559,ELAINE," George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.",29
29560,GEORGE," Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.",29
29561,KRAMER, What's that red dot on your sweater?,29
29562,ELAINE, What?,29
29563,GEORGE, Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.,29
29564,ELAINE, Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.,29
29565,GEORGE, What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?,29
29566,JERRY,"  Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.",29
29567,ELAINE, What don't you know?,29
29568,JERRY, I don't know.,29
29569,ELAINE, Well do you see it or don't you?,29
29570,JERRY, Ahem. Say that again?,29
29571,ELAINE, Do you see it or don't you?,29
29572,JERRY, Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.,29
29573,JERRY, Now what did you ask me again.,29
29574,ELAINE, You're still here. You're a dynamo.,29
29575,GEORGE, I can't believe I get paid for this.,29
29576,ELAINE, I'll see you tomorrow.,29
29577,GEORGE, How you doing?,29
29578,CLEANING WOMAN, Hello.,29
29579,JERRY," You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?",29
29580,GEORGE," Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.",29
29581,JERRY," Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.",29
29582,GEORGE, Why is that?,29
29583,JERRY, It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.,29
29584,GEORGE," So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... ",29
29585,JERRY, Convulsing?,29
29586,GEORGE, Convulsing?,29
29587,JERRY," I don't know, I'm trying to help you.",29
29588,GEORGE, Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.,29
29589,JERRY, You don't drink.,29
29590,GEORGE, I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.,29
29591,JERRY, So you started drinking.,29
29592,GEORGE," So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.",29
29593,JERRY, So how was it?,29
29594,GEORGE," Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.",29
29595,JERRY, Good thing the cleaning lady was there.,29
29596,ELAINE, Dick was fired.,29
29597,JERRY," You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.",29
29598,ELAINE, You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?,29
29599,JERRY, What are you saying?,29
29600,ELAINE, I'm not saying anything.,29
29601,JERRY, You're saying something.,29
29602,ELAINE, What could I be saying?,29
29603,JERRY, Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.,29
29604,ELAINE, If I was saying something I would have said it.,29
29605,JERRY, Well why don't you say it?,29
29606,ELAINE, I said it.,29
29607,JERRY, What did you say?,29
29608,ELAINE, Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.,29
29609,JERRY, Yeah?,29
29610,GEORGE,  It's George.,29
29611,JERRY, Come on up.,29
29612,ELAINE," Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper?  Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.",29
29613,JERRY, No I didn't.,29
29614,ELAINE," Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.",29
29615,JERRY, I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.,29
29616,ELAINE, How much did he save?,29
29617,JERRY," Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question  of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.",29
29618,GEORGE," I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.",29
29619,JERRY, Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.,29
29620,GEORGE, Did you tell her anything?,29
29621,JERRY, No.,29
29622,GEORGE, Do you swear?,29
29623,JERRY, I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.,29
29624,GEORGE, Oh you told her didn't you.,29
29625,JERRY, No.,29
29626,ELAINE," Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?",29
29627,GEORGE, What? Did I what?,29
29628,ELAINE, You did didn't you.,29
29629,GEORGE," Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season  and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.",29
29630,ELAINE, Well Jerry told me that you did.,29
29631,GEORGE, You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.,29
29632,JERRY, I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.,29
29633,GEORGE," Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time.  I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.",29
29634,GEORGE, This is for you.,29
29635,CLEANING WOMAN," Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me.",29
29636,GEORGE," As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.",29
29637,CLEANING WOMAN," Okay, okay, can I open it now?",29
29638,GEORGE, Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.,29
29639,CLEANING WOMAN, Oh! Is that cashmere?,29
29640,GEORGE, Of course it's cashemere.,29
29641,CLEANING WOMAN, A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!,29
29642,GEORGE, Just a little something for Christmas.,29
29643,CLEANING WOMAN," When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, ""what do you call this most beautiful fabric?"", and he said ""they call it cashmere"". I repeated the words ""cashmere, cashmere"". I asked if I could have it, and he said ""No. Get away from me."" Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.",29
29644,GEORGE," I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.",29
29645,CLEANING WOMAN," Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.",29
29646,GEORGE, Take it off. You're going to ruin it.,29
29647,CLEANING WOMAN,  What's this?,29
29648,JERRY," I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.",29
29649,DICK, The only stench is comming from you.,29
29650,AUDIENCE, Oooooh.,29
29651,JERRY," Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.",29
29652,DICK, It's off the wagon.,29
29653,JERRY, In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?,29
29654,DICK, I don't know.,29
29655,JERRY, On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?,29
29656,DICK, You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.,29
29657,JERRY, They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?,29
29658,DICK, What the hell do you know about wagons?,29
29659,JERRY, I know enough not to get on them.,29
29660,MR. LIPPMAN, I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?,29
29661,GEORGE, Who said that?,29
29662,MR. LIPPMAN, She did.,29
29663,GEORGE," Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.",29
29664,MR. LIPPMAN, You're fired.,29
29665,GEORGE, Well you didn't have to say it like that.,29
29666,MR. LIPPMAN, I want you out of here by the end of the day.,29
29667,GEORGE, What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?,29
29668,MR. LIPPMAN," Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this.",29
29669,ELAINE, You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.,29
29670,GEORGE, You never had sex in the office before?,29
29671,ELAINE, No. I once made out with someone but that was it.,29
29672,GEORGE, Alright so you made out with someone.,29
29673,ELAINE, Well that's not sex.,29
29674,GEORGE, Kissing is sex.,29
29675,ELAINE, Kissing is not sex.,29
29676,JERRY, George?,29
29677,GEORGE, Jerry.,29
29678,ELAINE," Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?",29
29679,GEORGE, No.,29
29680,JERRY, George?,29
29681,GEORGE, Over here.,29
29682,ELAINE, What are you doing here?,29
29683,JERRY, I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.,29
29684,ELAINE, Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?,29
29685,JERRY, I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.,29
29686,ELAINE," So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.",29
29687,JERRY, Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.,29
29688,DICK, Merry Christmas.,29
29689,ELAINE, Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.,29
29690,GEORGE," Hide, hide under the desk.",29
29691,ELAINE," Ow, ow move over.",29
29692,JERRY, Get off of me.,29
29693,ELAINE, I've got no room.,29
29694,DICK, Is that cashmere?,29
29695,GEORGE, Of course it's cashmere.,29
29696,DICK,  What's this?,29
29697,JERRY," But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.",29
29698,DICK, You mean on the wagon.,29
29699,JERRY, Don't get smart.,29
29700,KRAMER," All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.",30
29701,ELAINE, Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?,30
29702,KRAMER," Well, yeah...",30
29703,ELAINE," Ok, what time is your job interview George?",30

29705,JERRY," Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.",30
29706,GEORGE, Why not?,30
29707,JERRY," That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.",30
29708,GEORGE," What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.",30
29709,ELAINE," All right, I'm gonna go.",30
29710,JERRY, What time is the lesbian wedding?,30

29713,ELAINE," Yeah, they flip a coin.",30
29714,GEORGE," What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.",30
29715,JERRY, I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train ,30
29716,GEORGE," I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking",30
29717,KRAMER," Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.",30
29718,JERRY," Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?",30

29723,GEORGE, How many tickets are you paying today?,30
29724,KRAMER," Well, let's see",30
29725,GEORGE, No doors?,30
29726,KRAMER," I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.",30
29727,GEORGE," I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.",30
29728,VIOLIN PLAYER, Thank you.,30
29729,GEORGE, That guy is not blind.,30
29730,JERRY," So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?",30
29731,GEORGE, I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.,30
29732,JERRY, Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.,30
29733,GEORGE, That's amazing.,30
29734,JERRY, So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.,30

29745,WOMAN," Well, you're reading the classifieds.",30
29746,GEORGE," Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.",30
29747,WOMAN, You didn't look like someone who needed a job.,30
29748,GEORGE," Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.",30

29753,WOMAN," So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?",30
29754,GEORGE, They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.,30
29755,WOMAN, Really?,30
29756,GEORGE," Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.",30
29757,WOMAN, I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.,30
29758,ELAINE, It's ironic.,30
29759,ELAINE," This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.",30
29760,WOMAN," No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?",30
29761,ELAINE, Oh...,30
29762,WOMAN," Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?",30
29763,ELAINE, A wedding.,30

29780,GEORGE," Yeah, well....",30
29781,WOMAN, Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.,30
29782,GEORGE," Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.",30
29783,GEORGE," I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!",30
29784,JERRY," O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?",30
29785,NAKED MAN," Naked, dressed. I don't see any difference.",30
29786,JERRY, You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.,30
29787,NAKED MAN, You got something against naked body?,30
29788,JERRY," I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?",30
29789,NAKED MAN, Who's got time for squat thrusts?,30
29790,JERRY," All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.",30
29791,NAKED MAN, I like a good breakfast.,30
29792,JERRY," I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.",30
29793,NAKED MAN, I'm not ashamed of my body.,30
29794,JERRY," That's your problem, you should be.",30
29795,JERRY," Don't get up, please, allow me.",30

29804,GUY, His father was a mudda'?,30
29805,KRAMER, His mudda' was a mudda'.,30
29806,GUY, His mudda' was a mudda'?,30

29821,WOMAN," Oh, don't worry. I do.",30
29822,GEORGE," You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.",30
29823,WOMAN, Like what?,30
29824,GEORGE," Like a ""Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame""",30
29825,GEORGE, What's going on?,30
29826,WOMAN," It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.",30

29849,MAN AT THE COUNTER,"  Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna!",30
29850,GEORGE," How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?",30
29851,ELAINE, George?,30
29852,JERRY," Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?",30
29853,GEORGE," You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?",30
29854,JERRY," Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.",30
29855,GEORGE," Give me your key, I gotta get it.",30

29859,ELAINE," Here, pay. ",30
29860,KRAMER," Wait, wait, wait...",30
29861,GEORGE, ...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!,31
29862,GEORGE," We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?",31

29867,JERRY," All right, I'm sorry. What about her?",31
29868,GEORGE," What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?",31
29869,JERRY," I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.",31
29870,GEORGE," No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...",31
29871,GEORGE, How do I get the hand?,31
29872,JERRY, We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.,31
29873,GEORGE," She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...",31
29874,JERRY," Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...",31
29875,GEORGE," Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.",31
29876,KRAMER," Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!",31
29877,GEORGE," With all due respect, I don't think so...",31

29884,GEORGE," What the Hell is a ""Polar Bear""?",31
29885,KRAMER," Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....",31

29898,ELAINE," *No*, we would have heard it.",31
29899,JERRY," What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?",31
29900,GEORGE," I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.",31
29901,JERRY," [quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!",31
29902,JERRY, Is this okay? Can I do this? ,31
29903,STEVE, Something I said? [no response] It's John... Mollika.,31
29904,ELAINE," Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi...",31
29905,STEVE, What're you doing down here?,31
29906,ELAINE," Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.",31
29907,MOLLIKA, Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke up.,31
29908,ELAINE, We did. We're just hanging out.,31
29909,MOLLIKA, REally. ... You really look great.,31
29910,ELAINE," Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?",31
29911,MOLLIKA," Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs. I don't know what to do for the guy.",31
29912,ELAINE, Have you thought about an intervention?,31
29913,MOLLIKA, What's that?,31
29914,ELAINE," You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.",31
29915,MOLLIKA, He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.,31
29916,GEORGE, What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?,31
29917,JERRY," I dunno, it was an impulse.",31
29918,GEORGE, What kind of a sick impulse does that??,31
29919,JERRY, How could I know she would start to laugh?,31
29920,ELAINE, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!,31
29921,JERRY, Can we just go in already?,31
29922,GEORGE, What are we gonna tell her?,31
29923,ELAINE, I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.,31
29924,GEORGE," No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...",31
29925,ELAINE," [To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.",31
29926,JERRY, What about?,31
29927,GEORGE," Hey, hey! We're discussing something!",31
29928,JERRY," I know, but I'm distracted now.",31
29929,GEORGE, What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.,31
29930,ELAINE, When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.,31
29931,JERRY," Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?",31
29932,ELAINE, He's good.,31
29933,GEORGE," Uh, can we cut to the chase?",31
29934,JERRY," ""Cut to the chase""?",31
29935,GEORGE, Yeah...,31
29936,JERRY," What're you, ""Joe Hollywood""?",31
29937,GEORGE, A lot of people say it.,31
29938,JERRY, I would lose that.,31
29939,GEORGE, [Accusingly] What's *that*?,31
29940,JERRY," ""Lose that""? That's not a Hollywood expression!",31
29941,GEORGE, [Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.,31
29942,ELAINE, Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.,31
29943,JERRY," Really, an intervention ...",31
29944,GEORGE," Y'know people, we got a situation over here!",31
29945,ELAINE," Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.",31
29946,JERRY, Me? Why me?,31
29947,ELAINE, 'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.,31
29948,JERRY, Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...,31
29949,GEORGE," All right, OK, I'm goin' in.",31
29950,JERRY, We've got to talk about this ,31
29951,ELAINE, All right.,31
29952,GEORGE," Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.",31
29953,NOEL, No..,31
29954,GEORGE," Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel",31
29955,JERRY, You play a *Hell* of a piano.,31
29956,ELAINE," Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved.",31
29957,NOEL, Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. I was *humiliated...,31
29958,ELAINE," Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.",31
29959,NOEL," Well then, what was she laughing at?",31
29960,JERRY, Pez?,31
29961,NOEL," Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her?",31
29962,GEORGE," Me, uh, uh, no, ...",31
29963,JERRY, Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.,31
29964,ELAINE, Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.,31
29965,JERRY, Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.,31
29966,NOEL, I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life. [exits],31
29967,ELAINE, I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.,31
29968,GEORGE, If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful ,31
29969,GEORGE," All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.",31
29970,NOEL, I don't feel like it tonight.,31
29971,JERRY, We'll be outside,31
29972,ELAINE, Yeah,31
29973,JERRY," It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?",31
29974,NOEL, I just crack my knuckles.,31
29975,GEORGE, We'll have a good time,31
29976,NOEL, I don't feel like it,31
29977,GEORGE," Ah, come on",31
29978,NOEL, I said I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT!,31
29979,GEORGE," Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqué. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]",31
29980,JERRY, You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.,31
29981,ELAINE, What? How?,31
29982,JERRY, A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.,31
29983,ELAINE, So? What happened?,31
29984,JERRY," What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.",31
29985,ELAINE, Shut up!,31
29986,JERRY, All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.,31
29987,ELAINE, Whar about Kramer?,31
29988,JERRY, He's the same!,31
29989,JERRY," Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?",31
29990,KRAMER,"  Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?",31
29991,JERRY," Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.",31
29992,KRAMER, Can I get in on that?,31
29993,JERRY, What do you think? It's like a poker game?,31
29994,KRAMER, Is Elaine going?,31
29995,JERRY, Yeah,31
29996,KRAMER," Well, I knew him as well as she did.",31
29997,JERRY," Yeah, but John invited her.",31
29998,KRAMER," So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?",31
29999,JERRY," No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.",31
30000,GEORGE, It's George,31
30001,JERRY, Stop smelling your arm.,31
30002,KRAMER, You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach,31
30003,JERRY," Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, ""That's not a bad idea.""",31
30004,KRAMER, Tell me about it!,31
30005,JERRY," Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.",31
30006,GEORGE, Well it's over. It's definitely over.,31
30007,JERRY, She broke up with you?,31
30008,GEORGE," No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.",31
30009,JERRY, What was on the list?,31
30010,GEORGE," Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,",31
30011,JERRY," Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,",31
30012,GEORGE," Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said ""no, maybe we could get together for lunch."" You know what that means.",31
30013,JERRY, What's wrong with lunch?,31
30014,GEORGE, Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.,31
30015,KRAMER, I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?,31
30016,GEORGE, I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.,31
30017,KRAMER, Break up with her,31
30018,GEORGE, What?,31
30019,KRAMER, You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.,31
30020,JERRY, A preemptive breakup.,31
30021,GEORGE, A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.,31
30022,GEORGE," So, I am have to going to break up with you.",31
30023,NOEL, You're breaking up with me?,31
30024,GEORGE," I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.",31
30025,NOEL, Wow.,31
30026,GEORGE, Shocked?,31
30027,NOEL, I really am.,31
30028,GEORGE, Never expected this did you?,31
30029,NOEL, I thought everything was fine.,31
30030,GEORGE," Well, live and learn.",31
30031,NOEL, I don't understand. You're breaking up with me. Didn't we have fun doing the crossword puzzles?,31
30032,GEORGE, Kind of.,31
30033,NOEL, I'm very confused.,31
30034,GEORGE," Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.",31
30035,NOEL," I thought,...",31
30036,GEORGE," Now, stop it ...",31
30037,NOEL," What do you want, I can make you happy.",31
30038,GEORGE, When you're playing the piano do you think about me?,31
30039,NOEL, I don't know.,31
30040,GEORGE, This is what I'm talking about.,31
30041,NOEL," OK, I'll think about you.",31
30042,GEORGE, All the time.,31
30043,NOEL," All the time? ... OK, All the time.",31
30044,GEORGE, I can't hear you.,31

30046,GEORGE," See, It's not so hard.",31
30047,KRAMER," Go ahead smell, smell",31

30049,KRAMER, Do you recognize it? ... The beach.,31
30050,STEVE, What are you talking about?,31
30051,KRAMER," Oh, I'm talking about the beach.",31
30052,STEVE, What about it?,31
30053,KRAMER," You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.",31
30054,STEVE, That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.,31
30055,KRAMER," Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?",31
30056,STEVE, Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.,31
30057,KRAMER, So you don't think it's a good idea?,31
30058,GUY, The membranes get dried and it just starts bleeding. Since I was a kid so I have to stick tissue up there,31
30059,ELAINE,"  Uh, you have to work like that?",31
30060,GUY, Nobody minds Nobody has ever said anything to me.,31
30061,OTHER GUY, Are there any ice cubes?,31

30063,OTHER GUY, I looked. There aren't any ice cubes.,31
30064,JERRY, Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.,31
30065,OTHER GUY, I can't drink this. It's warm! ,31
30066,GUY, Shouldn't we rehearse this a little bit before Richie comes?,31
30067,STEVE, What's the plan?,31
30068,JERRY, Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.,31
30069,OTHER GUY," Well, if he's not going to talk I'm not going to talk either.",31

30092,JERRY," No, we're having an intervention",31
30093,OLD GUY, An intervention? Who's intervening?,31
30094,JERRY, There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.,31
30095,OLD GUY," Sure, we used to do that when one of our polar bears stopped coming. We would go to his house and say, ""What you don't want to be a polar bear anymore? It's too cold for you?""",31
30096,GUY, It's him.,31
30097,ROBERTA, What should we do?,31

30101,JERRY," Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.",31

30103,ELAINE," Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.",31
30104,GUY, Is it because I have a tissue in my nose?,31
30105,ELAINE, You're getting warm.,31

30112,JERRY," Well, you're looking well.",31
30113,GEORGE," Jerry, let me tell you something, ""A man without hand is not a man."" I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.",31
30114,STEVE, Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.,31
30115,GEORGE,  This man is a genius. Genius!,31
30116,STEVE, You think so?,31
30117,GEORGE," I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you",31
30118,OLD MAN, The male kangaroo doesn't have a pouch only the female has it. The male has pouch envy.,31
30119,ELAINE, ,31
30120,ELAINE, ,31
30121,NOEL, That laugh. That's the laugh. That's it. You're the one.,31
30122,ELAINE," No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.",31
30123,NOEL, You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during my recital?.,31
30124,JERRY, I didn't know she would laugh.,31
30125,NOEL," You lied to me George, you lied to me.",31
30126,GEORGE," No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?",31
30127,NOEL, I ... am breaking up ... with you!,31
30128,GEORGE, You can't break up with me. I've got hand.,31
30129,NOEL, And you're going to need it.,31
30130,JERRY, Hey Richie,31
30131,RICHIE, So what's going on?,31
30132,JERRY," It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.",31
30133,GEORGE, I can't do these puzzles.,31
30134,JERRY, So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table,31
30135,GEORGE, Ah ah Pez dispenser.,31
30136,JERRY," He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them",31
30137,GEORGE, Well they're hard to load.,31
30138,JERRY, Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.,31
30139,GEORGE, Poor kid.,31
30140,JERRY, So as he's telling the story he starts crying.,31
30141,GEORGE, What did you do?,31
30142,JERRY, What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.,31
30143,GEORGE, Wow,31
30144,JERRY, Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.,31
30145,GEORGE, What's a three letter word for candy?,31
30146,JERRY, I can't do those things.,31
30147,JERRY,"The thing I don’t understand about the suicide person is the people who try and commit suicide for some reason they don’t die and that’s it. They stop trying. Why? Why don’t they just keep trying? What has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact it’s worse because now they’ve found out one more thing you stink at. Okay, that’s why these people don’t succeed in life to begin with. Because they give up too easy. I saw, pills don’t work, try a rope. Car won’t start in the garage, get a tune up. You know what I mean? There’s nothing more rewarding than reaching a goal you have set for yourself.",32
30148,JERRY, Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?,32
30149,ELAINE, Na.,32
30150,JERRY, What are you doing? We’re going out for dinner in ten minutes.,32
30151,ELAINE, Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?,32
30152,JERRY, Yeah.,32
30153,GEORGE, It’s George.,32
30154,JERRY, Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You’ve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?,32
30155,ELAINE, I don’t know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?,32
30156,JERRY, I think I’ll take out the garbage.,32
30157,ELAINE," Hey, have you ever fasted?",32
30158,JERRY," Well, once I didn’t have dinner until, like 9",32
30159,GEORGE," Yeah, right.",32

30167,GEORGE, It’s an incredible deal. I don’t know why you don’t come with me.,32
30168,JERRY," Nah, I don’t go for these non-refundable deals. I can’t commit to a woman. I’m not going to commit to an airline.",32

30174,JERRY, How much do they cost?,32
30175,GINA, The junior?,32
30176,GEORGE," No, no the full size.",32
30177,JERRY," No, no the junior.",32
30178,GEORGE," You didn’t say ""junior"".",32
30179,GINA, I haven’t had one of those since I was a little girl.,32
30180,JERRY, Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here!  How ya’ doing?,32
30181,MARTIN, Good enough.,32

30186,ELAINE," Oh, that creepy guy?",32
30187,JERRY," Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?",32
30188,GEORGE, He didn’t seem too pleased.,32
30189,ELAINE, Maybe I’ll get a steak with french fried onion wings.,32
30190,GEORGE," hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.",32
30191,JERRY, What’s so amazing? You’ve seen him before.,32
30192,GEORGE, I haven’t seen him for months.,32
30193,JERRY, What was the dream?,32
30194,GEORGE, I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.,32
30195,JERRY, I think I’ve played there.,32
30196,GEORGE, I’ve had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.,32
30197,JERRY, You’re a little paranormal,32
30198,ELAINE," Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.",32
30199,GEORGE, Really?,32
30200,ELAINE," Uh uh, you should go some time.",32
30201,GEORGE, I’d love to go. Make an appointment.,32
30202,JERRY," Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?",32
30203,GEORGE, I just got fired.,32
30204,JERRY," Alright, come on, lets get out of here.",32
30205,ELAINE, I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.,32
30206,JERRY, I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.,32
30207,ELAINE, Really?,32
30208,JERRY," Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.",32
30209,JERRY, Who is it? Who is it?,32
30210,GINA, It’s Gina.,32
30211,JERRY, Who?,32
30212,GINA, Martine’s girl friend.,32
30213,JERRY, Martine?,32
30214,GINA, You next door neighbour.,32
30215,JERRY," Oh, Martin!",32
30216,GEORGE, It’s Martine. I think he’s dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.,32
30217,JERRY, What?,32
30218,GINA, Come on.,32
30219,JERRY, In my pajamas? I better get my robe.,32
30220,GINA, We don’t have enough time.,32
30221,JERRY, It’ll take two seconds.,32
30222,GINA, There is no time.,32
30223,JERRY, We don’t have two seconds?,32
30224,GINA, All right. Go ahead.,32
30225,JERRY," Nah, forget it.",32
30226,GINA," No, go ahead.",32
30227,JERRY, Nah. I’ll just wear the pajamas.,32
30228,GINA, Will you just get it.,32
30229,JERRY, Are you sure?,32
30230,GINA, Forget it. Come on.,32
30231,JERRY," Nah, I’ll go get the robe.",32
30232,JERRY, That’s not too bad. It’s not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.,32
30233,GINA, You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.,32
30234,JERRY, Really? It’s over?,32
30235,GINA," I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a man’s hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.",32
30236,JERRY," Oh boy, did he say anything about me?",32
30237,GINA, He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drake’s Coffee Cake.,32
30238,JERRY, He said that?,32
30239,GINA, He was screaming about it all night. How it’s too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.,32
30240,JERRY, I’m sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.,32
30241,GINA, I wasn’t.,32
30242,JERRY, You weren’t?,32
30243,GINA," No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?",32
30244,JERRY, Of course.,32
30245,GINA, Tell me everything.,32
30246,JERRY," Are you sure he can’t hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.",32
30247,GINA, I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.,32
30248,JERRY," I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they’re going to look at a thing like this.",32
30249,GINA, I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.,32
30250,JERRY," No, I just wanted to see what time it was.",32
30251,GINA, Are you afraid of him?,32
30252,JERRY, No.,32
30253,GINA, Then kiss me.,32
30254,JERRY, Here?,32
30255,GINA," Yes, right here.",32
30256,JERRY, Is this the proper venue?,32
30257,GINA, You don’t want to?,32
30258,JERRY," No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.",32
30259,GINA, Then kiss me right in front of him.,32
30260,JERRY, I can’t. What if he wakes up?,32
30261,GINA, A man is lying here unconscious and you’re afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?,32
30262,JERRY," A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy’s got a coma going like this … you don’t want to mess with it.",32
30263,KRAMER, Hey.,32
30264,JERRY, Hey.,32
30265,KRAMER, Did you hear about Martin?,32
30266,JERRY," Yeah, I heard.",32
30267,KRAMER, I can’t believe he’s in a coma.,32
30268,KRAMER, He’s got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?,32
30269,JERRY, Who told you about Martin?,32
30270,KRAMER, Newman! He’s good friends with him.,32
30271,JERR," Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.",32
30272,KRAMER," He’s got all of my attachments, you know.",32
30273,JERRY," Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?",32
30274,KRAMER," What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?",32
30275,JERRY, You know I don’t get that whole suicide machine. There’s no tall buildings where these people live? They can’t wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?,32
30276,KRAMER, So what’s going on between you and Gina?,32
30277,JERRY," Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.",32
30278,KRAMER," Uh, uh.",32
30279,JERRY, So we’re in the room and she’s trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.,32
30280,KRAMER," Uh, uh, you see that’s the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?",32
30281,JERRY, Nothing.,32
30282,KRAMER," Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don’t have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?",32
30283,JERRY, I didn’t know what the coma etiquette was.,32
30284,KRAMER," There is no coma etiquette. You see that’s the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn’t matter what you do around it.",32
30285,JERRY," So you’re saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it’s all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.",32
30286,KRAMER," I’d give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can’t get out of it in 24 hours, it’s a land rush.",32
30287,JERRY," So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he’s thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there’s nothing left?",32
30288,KRAMER, NOTHING LEFT! That’s why I’m trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody’s going to grab it.,32
30289,RULA, Martin’s spirit came to you as a warning.,32
30290,ELAINE, Why would he come to George?,32
30291,RULA, Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE.,32
30292,GEORGE, I knew it. I always felt different.,32
30293,RULA, You are. Some coffee cake?,32
30294,GEORGE, Drakes?,32
30295,RULA, Yes.,32
30296,GEORGE, Did you buy this for me?,32
30297,RULA," No, why?",32
30298,GEORGE," Ha, because I love Drake’s Coffee Cake.",32
30299,RULA, Maybe I did.,32
30300,ELAINE, Take it away.,32
30301,GEORGE, She hasn’t eaten in two days.,32
30302,RULA, Who’s Pauline?,32
30303,GEORGE, Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.,32
30304,RULA, Do you think about her?,32
30305,GEORGE, When I hear her name mentioned.,32
30306,RULA, Cut these with your left hand.,32
30307,GEORGE," There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.",32
30308,RULA," I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.",32
30309,GEORGE," Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?",32
30310,RULA, Not in this life.,32
30311,ELAINE, Should you be smoking?,32
30312,RULA, Does it bother you?,32
30313,ELAINE, You’re pregnant.,32
30314,GEORGE, Elaine.,32
30315,RULA, I smoked when I had Faisy.,32
30316,RULA, Ah oh.,32
30317,GEORGE, Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?,32
30318,RULA, I don’t know about this trip George.,32
30319,GEORGE, You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?,32
30320,ELAINE, It’s really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.,32
30321,GEORGE," Elaine, she’s a psychic. She knows how the kid’s going to be.",32
30322,GEORGE, Should I not go on this trip?,32
30323,RULA," George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me.",32
30324,ELAINE," Now listen. I just don’t know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.",32
30325,GEORGE," Elaine, what are you doing?",32
30326,ELAINE, It’s disgusting.,32
30327,RULA, I DON’T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave.,32
30328,ELAINE," Oh fine, I don’t like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.",32
30329,RULA, Get the hell out.,32
30330,GEORGE, A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?,32
30331,RULA, Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.,32
30332,GEORGE, If you don’t say anything I will assume it’s a plane crash.,32
30333,RULA, Get out.,32
30334,GEORGE, Not a plane crash.  Is it a plane crash?,32
30335,GINA, I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.,32
30336,JERRY, You can say what you want about me but I’ll be damned if I’m going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.,32
30337,GINA, It is too small for someone with such a big mouth . Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?,32
30338,JERRY," No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.",32
30339,GINA, Who are these Stooges you speak of?,32
30340,JERRY, They’re a comedy team.,32
30341,GINA, Tell me about them. Everything.,32
30342,JERRY," Well, they’re three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.",32
30343,GINA, You will show me The Stooges?,32
30344,JERRY, I will show you The Stooges.,32
30345,GINA, When?,32
30346,JERRY," Well, I don’t really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.",32
30347,GINA," Come, you walk me to a cab.",32
30348,JERRY," Well, uh, I uh, I don’t want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it’s not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.",32
30349,GINA, You’re still afraid. You are not a man.,32
30350,JERRY, Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?,32
30351,GINA, Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?,32
30352,JERRY," Yeah, all right. All right.",32
30353,KRAMER, You should just eat fruit.,32
30354,NEWMAN, I can’t eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.,32
30355,KRAMER, ???,32
30356,NEWMAN, Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.,32
30357,JERRY, Hello Newman.,32
30358,JERRY, Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.,32
30359,GEORGE," People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didn’t hurt me.",32
30360,ELAINE,  Did you see that wall move?,32
30361,JERRY," Boy, it’s a good thing we came.",32
30362,GEORGE, Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe there’s native unrest.,32
30363,ELAINE," Hi, I haven’t eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.",32
30364,NURSE, We’ll call you.,32
30365,JERRY," George, I want you to promise me something. If I’m ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.",32
30366,GEORGE, How come?,32
30367,JERRY, Looters.,32
30368,ELAINE, How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?,32
30369,JERRY, She’s really hungry.,32
30370,KRAMER, Hey.,32
30371,ELAINE, Kramer,32
30372,KRAMER," Well, Newman’s upstairs visiting Martin.",32
30373,GEORGE, Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?,32
30374,KRAMER, You’re not going?,32
30375,GEORGE, No.,32
30376,KRAMER, Why not?,32
30377,GEORGE, The psychic said something terrible will happen.,32
30378,KRAMER, I dig.,32
30379,KRAMER," I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, she’s going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, she’s going to kill me.",32
30380,NEWMAN," He can’t hear you, you idiot. Why don’t you just buy another one.",32
30381,KRAMER, Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?,32
30382,NEWMAN, I have a carpet sweeper you can use.,32
30383,KRAMER, I don’t want a carpet sweeper. They don’t do anything.,32
30384,NEWMAN, It gets my rug clean.,32
30385,KRAMER, The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.,32
30386,NEWMAN," Well, you should take a look at my rug then.",32
30387,KRAMER, I wouldn’t set foot in your house.,32
30388,JERRY, Hello.,32
30389,NEWMAN, Hello Jerry.,32
30390,JERRY, How’s he doing?,32
30391,KRAMER, He looks happy to me.,32
30392,NEWMAN, I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.,32
30393,JERRY, Why wouldn’t he?,32
30394,NEWMAN, No reason.,32
30395,JERRY," He’ll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.",32
30396,NEWMAN, I’ll bring him up to date.,32
30397,JERRY, How up to date?,32
30398,NEWMAN," Oh, all the way up.",32
30399,JERRY, And nothing could change your mind?,32
30400,NEWMAN," Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.",32
30401,KRAMER," Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. He’s not going.",32
30402,NEWMAN," I don’t care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..",32
30403,JERRY, Drake’s Coffee Cake,32
30404,NEWMAN," Wow, where did you get that?",32
30405,JERRY, From my house. I got a whole box of them.,32
30406,NEWMAN," Boy, that’s the full size.",32
30407,JERRY, That’s your big boy.,32
30408,NEWMAN, Can I have a bite?,32
30409,JERRY, I don’t give out bites. I got another one. But I’m saving it for later.,32
30410,NEWMAN, Just one bite?,32
30411,JERRY," I don’t think so. You know they, they’re so fragile.",32
30412,NEWMAN, All right! All right. I won’t say anything.,32
30413,JERRY, You swear?,32
30414,NEWMAN, I swear.,32
30415,JERRY, On your mother’s life?,32
30416,NEWMAN, On my mother’s life.,32
30417,KRAMER, oh oh oh oh oh,32
30418,NEWMAN," Oooh,",32
30419,ELAINE," And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.",32
30420,GEORGE," …sweetheart, no come here, … sweetheart",32
30421,RULA," pew, pew, pew, pew ",32
30422,GEORGE, how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.,32
30423,RULA, The nurse said she would be right back. They’re supposed to take me into the delivery room.,32
30424,GEORGE," Oh, that’s great. That’s great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I don’t even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldn’t get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..",32
30425,RULA," Oh, where’s the nurse",32
30426,GEORGE, I don’t know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why don’t you get a nurse for mommy? … Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.,32
30427,RULA, Don’t take that trip.,32
30428,GEORGE," Yeah, why? Why?",32
30429,RULA,"  EEEY, beegit, beegit beegit.",32
30430,GEORGE, Because? Because?,32
30431,ELAINE, Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this! … Drake’s Coffee Cake? … Give me that.,32
30432,NEWMAN," Jerry, you better stop her or I’ll tell.",32
30433,JERRY, Elaine! No! No!,32
30434,MARTIN," Ooooh, ahhhh,",32
30435,GEORGE, Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?,32
30436,NEWMAN," He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.",32
30437,KRAMER, I want my vacuum cleaner!,32
30438,JERRY, Hey!,32
30439,NEWMAN, It was disgusting.,32
30440,JERRY, What are you doing? We’re going out to dinner in ten minutes.,32
30441,GEORGE, I never assisted in a birth before. It’s really quite disgusting.,32
30442,JERRY, What did she name the kid?,32
30443,GEORGE, You wouldn’t believe it. Rasputin.,32
30444,KRAMER, Heey!,32
30445,GEORGE, Hey.,32
30446,JERRY, Hey.,32
30447,GEORGE, when did you get back?,32
30448,KRAMER, A couple of hours ago.,32
30449,GEORGE, So how was it?,32
30450,KRAMER," George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.",32
30451,JERRY, osh.,32
30452,KRAMER, They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.,32
30453,JERRY, Woah. ,32
30454,KRAMER, Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.,32
30455,JERRY, Wow! ,32
30456,KRAMER, I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson,32
30457,JERRY, Oh! ,32
30458,KRAMER, We played Backgammon in the nude.,32
30459,JERRY, Oh! ,32
30460,KRAMER, She’s a sweet kid.,32
30461,JERRY, Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!,32
30462,KRAMER," Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. That’s probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.",32
30463,GEORGE," Yeah, you gotta’ watch for the jellyfish.",32
30464,KRAMER, Yeah.,32
30465,KRAMER, What’s this?,32
30466,JERRY," Oh, it’s an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.",32
30467,KRAMER, They moved in together?,32
30468,JERRY," Yeah, it’s some place down in the village.",32
30469,KRAMER, Phew.,32
30470,JERRY, Yeah.,32
30471,ELAINE, It’s Elaine.,32
30472,JERRY, All right we’re coming down.,32
30473,KRAMER," Hey, where ya’ going?",32
30474,JERRY," We’re taking Elaine to dinner. She’s got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?",32
30475,KRAMER," Um, I’d like to but a bunch of us from the islands, we’ll be getting together.",32
30476,GEORGE, Elle McPherson going to be there?,32
30477,KRAMER, OH! I got to call her back.,32
30478,GEORGE," Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.",33
30479,JERRY," Oh, yes you will.",33
30480,GEORGE," No, I won't.",33
30481,JERRY," Yeah, maybe you won't.",33
30482,GEORGE," I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.",33
30483,JERRY, Are my nostrils getting bigger?,33
30484,GEORGE," No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, ""Hi. I'm",33
30485,CYNTHIA," There's just no men out there, you know?",33
30486,ELAINE, I know.,33
30487,CYNTHIA, I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves to one person.,33
30488,ELAINE, I hate the good ones.,33
30489,CYNTHIA, Is Jerry one of the good ones?,33
30490,ELAINE," That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.",33
30491,CYNTHIA," Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about not being one of the good ones that they're always going, ""Well I'm not good enough for you, what are you doing with me?"" and eventually I just go, ""You're right.""",33
30492,ELAINE," You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.",33
30493,CYNTHIA," No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.",33
30494,GEORGE, I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.,33
30495,JERRY," Oh, so there's still hope.",33
30496,GEORGE," I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.",33
30497,JERRY," Oh, so hopelessness is the key.",33
30498,GEORGE, It's my only hope.,33
30499,CYNTHIA," See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother. I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that.",33
30500,ELAINE," Well, at least you're not bitter.",33
30501,CYNTHIA, Who says I'm not bitter?,33
30502,ELAINE, Aren't you too young to be bitter?,33
30503,CYNTHIA," No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.",33
30504,ELAINE," Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.",33
30505,CYNTHIA," Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.",33
30506,JERRY," Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.",33
30507,ELAINE, So what'd you do last night?,33
30508,JERRY," Went out with George, you?",33
30509,ELAINE, Went out with Cynthia.,33
30510,JERRY, How was it? What'd you talk about?,33
30511,ELAINE," Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?",33
30512,JERRY," We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.",33
30513,ELAINE," I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.",33
30514,JERRY, George too.,33
30515,JERRY," Yeah, right.",33
30516,ELAINE," Yeah, right.",33
30517,JERRY, I've never fixed anybody up.,33
30518,ELAINE," Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.",33
30519,JERRY, Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?,33
30520,ELAINE," I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?",33
30521,JERRY, Well you implied it.,33
30522,ELAINE, I didn't say it.,33
30523,JERRY," Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?",33
30524,ELAINE, Who is he?,33
30525,JERRY, He's George!,33
30526,ELAINE, She's Cynthia!,33
30527,JERRY, So what?,33
30528,ELAINE," What, you don't think she's beautiful?",33
30529,JERRY," I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?",33
30530,ELAINE, You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.,33
30531,JERRY, I went out with you.,33
30532,ELAINE," That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.",33
30533,JERRY," Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.",33
30534,ELAINE, He can really do that?,33
30535,JERRY," Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.",33
30536,ELAINE," What, are you into this?",33
30537,JERRY," Yeah, come on, it's a good match.",33
30538,ELAINE," No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?",33
30539,JERRY, Naturally.,33
30540,ELAINE," Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?",33
30541,JERRY, Everything.,33
30542,ELAINE, What if it worked out?,33
30543,JERRY , Yeah right.,33
30544,GEORGE, Out of the question. Out of the question!,33
30545,JERRY, Why?,33
30546,GEORGE," No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?",33
30547,JERRY, She's good looking.,33
30548,GEORGE, How good looking?,33
30549,JERRY, Very good looking.,33
30550,GEORGE, Really good looking?,33
30551,JERRY, Really very good looking.,33
30552,GEORGE, Would you take her out?,33
30553,JERRY," Yes, I would take her out.",33
30554,GEORGE," Oh, you hesitated.",33
30555,JERRY, What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!,33
30556,GEORGE," No, something's off here, you hesitated.",33
30557,JERRY," I'm telling you, she's good looking.",33
30558,GEORGE," What about the body, what kind of body?",33
30559,JERRY," Good body, nice body.",33
30560,GEORGE, How nice?,33
30561,JERRY, Nice.,33
30562,GEORGE, Just nice?,33
30563,JERRY, Pretty nice.,33
30564,GEORGE, Really good?,33
30565,JERRY, Really very nice and good.,33
30566,GEORGE, What about personality?,33
30567,JERRY, Good personality. Funny. Bright.,33
30568,GEORGE, Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.,33
30569,JERRY, How could she be smarter than you?,33
30570,GEORGE," Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?",33
30571,CYNTHIA," First of all, what does he do?",33
30572,ELAINE," He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-",33
30573,CYNTHIA, He's not working?! How come he's not working?,33
30574,ELAINE," Well, um, he, he got fired.",33
30575,CYNTHIA, Why did he get fired?,33
30576,ELAINE," Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.",33
30577,CYNTHIA, Excuse me?,33
30578,ELAINE," Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.",33
30579,CYNTHIA, Is he nuts?,33
30580,ELAINE," No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.",33
30581,CYNTHIA, What does he look like?,33
30582,ELAINE, Pardon?,33
30583,CYNTHIA, What does he look like?,33
30584,ELAINE," Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.",33
30585,CYNTHIA," Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?",33
30586,ELAINE," Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.",33
30587,CYNTHIA, He's bald?,33
30588,ELAINE," No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.",33
30589,CYNTHIA, So he will be bald.,33
30590,ELAINE, Yup.,33
30591,GEORGE, What kind of hair?,33
30592,JERRY," You know, long dark hair.",33
30593,GEORGE, Flowing?,33
30594,JERRY, Flowing?,33
30595,GEORGE," Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.",33
30596,JERRY," 'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?",33
30597,GEORGE," Yeah, that's right.",33
30598,JERRY, Just clarifying.,33
30599,GEORGE, Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?,33
30600,JERRY, Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?,33
30601,GEORGE, I'd like to be able to get it out.,33
30602,JERRY, I think you'll get it out.,33
30603,GEORGE," What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.",33
30604,JERRY, She's got a fine cheek.,33
30605,GEORGE, Is there a pinkish hue?,33
30606,JERRY, A pinkish hue?,33
30607,GEORGE," Yes, a rosy glow.",33
30608,JERRY," There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.",33
30609,GEORGE," Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.",33
30610,JERRY, I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.,33
30611,CYNTHIA, Has he ever been married?,33
30612,ELAINE, No.,33
30613,CYNTHIA, Has he been close?,33
30614,ELAINE, He once spent a weekend with a woman.,33
30615,CYNTHIA, He didn't really try to poison his boss?,33
30616,ELAINE," Yeah, he did.",33
30617,GEORGE," We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?",33
30618,JERRY, I think it's tamber.,33
30619,GEORGE," Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?",33
30620,JERRY, I didn't notice the voice.,33
30621,GEORGE, It's mellifluous!,33
30622,JERRY," So, Saturday night.",33
30623,GEORGE," She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.",33
30624,ELAINE, Hi.,33
30625,GEORGE, Hey! Saturday night!,33
30626,ELAINE, I know!,33
30627,GEORGE," So, what did she say?",33
30628,ELAINE, She said you're getting together Saturday night!,33
30629,GEORGE, That's it?,33
30630,ELAINE, Yeah!,33
30631,GEORGE, She didn't mention anything about the conversation?,33
30632,ELAINE, No.,33
30633,GEORGE," Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?",33
30634,ELAINE, What?,33
30635,JERRY, She could have mentioned the conversation.,33
30636,GEORGE," Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.",33
30637,KRAMER, Hey.,33
30638,JERRY, Hey.,33
30639,KRAMER," You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?",33
30640,JERRY," Oh, the guy from Jersey?",33
30641,KRAMER," Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.",33
30642,GEORGE, What are you gonna do with all of them?,33
30643,KRAMER," Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.",33
30644,JERRY," No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.",33
30645,KRAMER," Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.",33
30646,ELAINE," Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.",33
30647,GEORGE, I'll take one. It's possible.,33
30648,JERRY," So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?",33
30649,ELAINE, I think they went out to dinner.,33
30650,JERRY," Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?",33
30651,GEORGE," Yeah, it's me, I just got home.",33
30652,JERRY," Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.",33
30653,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.",33
30654,JERRY," Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.",33
30655,ELAINE, Remember our pact. Full disclosure.,33
30656,JERRY," Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.",33
30657,GEORGE," Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.",33
30658,JERRY," You can tell me, I'll vault it.",33
30659,GEORGE, It's in the vault?,33
30660,JERRY, I'm locking the vault. What?,33
30661,GEORGE, We had sex.,33
30662,JERRY," Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?",33
30663,GEORGE, I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.,33
30664,JERRY, At your apartment?,33
30665,GEORGE, Yeah.,33
30666,JERRY, She didn't stay over?,33
30667,GEORGE," No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.",33
30668,ELAINE, Oh my god.,33
30669,CYNTHIA, He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.,33
30670,ELAINE, So? How was it?,33
30671,CYNTHIA, How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.,33
30672,ELAINE," Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.",33
30673,CYNTHIA," Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.",33
30674,ELAINE," Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello?",33
30675,JERRY," So, what did she have to say?",33
30676,ELAINE, What did he have to say?,33
30677,JERRY, He said they had a good time.,33
30678,ELAINE, Her too.,33
30679,JERRY," Oh, good.",33
30680,ELAINE, Anything else?,33
30681,JERRY, Nope. You?,33
30682,ELAINE, Nope.,33
30683,JERRY, You sure?,33
30684,ELAINE, Yup. You?,33
30685,JERRY, Yeah.,33
30686,ELAINE," Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.",33
30687,JERRY, Yeah. Okay then.,33
30688,ELAINE, Alright. Goodnight.,33
30689,JERRY, Goodnight.,33
30690,GEORGE," I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.",33
30691,JERRY," Well, I'm gonna do something about this.",33
30692,GEORGE, What are you gonna do?,33
30693,JERRY," Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.",33
30694,GEORGE," I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.",33
30695,JERRY, I'm gonna call her.,33
30696,GEORGE," No, don't call her.",33
30697,JERRY," No, I'm calling her.",33
30698,GEORGE," No, Jerry, don't call.",33
30699,JERRY," No, forget it, I'm gonna call.",33
30700,GEORGE, I don't want you to call.,33
30701,JERRY," Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.",33
30702,GEORGE, Give me the phone!,33
30703,JERRY," George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?",33
30704,GEORGE," Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!",33
30705,KRAMER," Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!",33
30706,JERRY, I'll just call her when you leave!,33
30707,GEORGE," You can't do that, it's none of your business!",33
30708,JERRY, It is so my business!,33
30709,KRAMER, Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!,33
30710,GEORGE, But tell him to give me the--,33
30711,KRAMER," Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?",33
30712,GEORGE, No.,33
30713,JERRY," Yeah, but--",33
30714,KRAMER," Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.",33
30715,JERRY, But Kramer--,33
30716,KRAMER," Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.",33
30717,KRAMER," Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.",33
30718,GEORGE, What?,33
30719,KRAMER, Right.,33
30720,GEORGE, Defective?!,33
30721,KRAMER, Defective.,33
30722,GEORGE,  How could you give me a defective condom?!,33
30723,KRAMER, I didn't even know they were defective.,33
30724,KRAMER, Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.,33
30725,GEORGE, What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!,33
30726,JERRY," Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!",33
30727,CYNTHIA, I missed my period.,33
30728,ELAINE, Oh my god.,33
30729,CYNTHIA," I am very worried, I am never late.",33
30730,ELAINE," But he used a condom, right?",33
30731,CYNTHIA," I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.",33
30732,ELAINE, Oh no.,33
30733,CYNTHIA, What?,33
30734,ELAINE, Was it blue?,33
30735,CYNTHIA, Yeah. How'd you know?,33
30736,ELAINE, Just a hunch.,33
30737,JERRY, Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!,33
30738,JERRY," Oh, hi. Soda?",33
30739,ELAINE, No thanks.,33
30740,JERRY, So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?,33
30741,ELAINE, Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.,33
30742,JERRY," Oh, I know her. I know her type.",33
30743,ELAINE, Her type? What type?,33
30744,JERRY," The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!",33
30745,ELAINE," You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!",33
30746,JERRY," I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.",33
30747,ELAINE, She's not bitter!,33
30748,JERRY," Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!",33
30749,ELAINE," Twisted? God, I did you a favor.",33
30750,JERRY," I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?",33
30751,ELAINE, Are you calling me a liar?,33
30752,JERRY," I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?",33
30753,ELAINE, Are you?,33
30754,JERRY, Get your finger out of my face.,33
30755,ELAINE," You get yours out, I was here first!",33
30756,JERRY, I don't care.,33
30757,ELAINE, Get it out!,33
30758,KRAMER," Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.",33
30759,ELAINE, I knew those condoms were defective!,33
30760,JERRY, How did you know they were defective?!,33
30761,ELAINE, Because! Because she missed her period!,33
30762,GEORGE, She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!,33
30763,CYNTHIA," So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.",33
30764,ELAINE, Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.,33
30765,CYNTHIA," I said to him, ""I really appreciate this, but I just got my period."" And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--",33
30766,ELAINE, Hi!,33
30767,GEORGE," Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.",33
30768,ELAINE, What happened?,33
30769,JERRY, Acting.,33
30770,ELAINE, Very mature.,33

30812,GEORGE, I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff,34
30813,JERRY, So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.,34
30814,GEORGE, ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension,34
30815,JERRY," Hey, should we say something to him?",34
30816,GEORGE," Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.",34

30828,KEITH, I love that bit about Jimmy Olson,34
30829,JERRY, Thank you.,34
30830,GEORGE," You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...",34
30831,KEITH,  Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?,34
30832,JERRY, I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.,34
30833,GEORGE," But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.",34
30834,KEITH," You know, I live on the East Side.",34
30835,JERRY," I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.",34
30836,KEITH, or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee,34
30837,JERRY, Oh. that would be great.,34
30838,GEORGE," Uh, it's only a matter of time.",34
30839,KEITH, Who's this chucker?,34
30840,JERRY, It's been three days and he hasn't called.,34
30841,ELAINE, Well maybe you should call him.,34
30842,JERRY, I can't ... I can't,34
30843,ELAINE, Why not?,34
30844,JERRY, I don't know. I just feel he should call me.,34
30845,ELAINE, What's the difference?,34
30846,JERRY," You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.",34
30847,ELAINE," Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.",34
30848,JERRY, I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?,34
30849,ELAINE, I'm sorry honey.,34
30850,JERRY," I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.",34
30851,ELAINE," No,",34
30852,JERRY, Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?,34
30853,ELAINE, I know.,34
30854,JERRY," What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.",34
30855,ELAINE, Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.,34
30856,JERRY," Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!",34
30857,ELAINE, You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?,34
30858,JERRY," Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?",34
30859,ELAINE, Why don't you just go ahead and call him?,34
30860,JERRY," I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?",34
30861,ELAINE, Just ask him if he wants a to get together.,34
30862,JERRY, For what dinner?,34
30863,ELAINE, Dinner's good.,34
30864,JERRY, Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?,34
30865,ELAINE," Jerry, He's A GUY!",34
30866,JERRY, ... this is all .. very confusing.,34
30867,MRS. SOKOL, You know you only have two more weeks before your benefits run out.,34

30869,MRS. SOKOL, So where have you been looking for work?,34

30927,JERRY, Hellooo Newman.,34
30928,KRAMER, I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.,34
30929,NEWMAN, I despise him.,34
30930,ELAINE, Why?,34
30931,NEWMAN, Why? I'll tell you why...,34
30932,KRAMER, Let me tell it ..,34
30933,NEWMAN," No, you can't tell it ..",34
30934,KRAMER, You always tell it ..,34
30935,NEWMAN," All right, tell it.",34
30936,KRAMER, Ja ja ja - just tell it,34
30937,NEWMAN," June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.",34
30938,KRAMER," Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, "" Nice game pretty boy."". Keith continued past us up the ramp.",34
30939,NEWMAN," A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.",34
30940,ELAINE, What was it?,34
30941,KRAMER," He spit on us.... and I screamed out, ""I'm hit!""",34
30942,NEWMAN, Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.,34
30943,ELAINE, Wow! What a story.,34
30944,JERRY, Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.,34
30945,JERRY," Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.",34
30946,NEWMAN, Well that's the way it happened.,34
30947,JERRY, What happened to your head when you got hit?,34
30948,KRAMER," Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left",34
30949,JERRY, Again,34
30950,KRAMER, Back and to the left,34
30951,JERRY, Back and to the left Back and to the left,34
30952,ELAINE," So, what are you saying?",34
30953,JERRY, I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.,34
30954,ELAINE, So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.,34
30955,JERRY, But that is not what they would have you believe.,34
30956,NEWMAN, I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. ,34
30957,KRAMER," Wait, wait, ",34
30958,JERRY, The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.,34
30959,GEORGE,  Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?,34
30960,JERRY, No. What happened to you?,34
30961,GEORGE," Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer ""Vandelay Industries"".",34
30962,JERRY, I'm Vandelay Industries?,34
30963,GEORGE, Right.,34
30964,JERRY, And what is that?,34
30965,GEORGE, You're in latex,34
30966,JERRY, Latex? And what do I do with latex?,34
30967,GEORGE, Ya manufacture it.,34
30968,ELAINE, Here in this little apartment?,34
30969,JERRY, And what do I say about you?,34
30970,GEORGE, You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.,34
30971,JERRY, I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?,34
30972,GEORGE, Right.,34
30973,JERRY, I don't think so. Why would I do that?,34
30974,GEORGE, Because I asked you to.,34
30975,JERRY," If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.",34
30976,JERRY, Yeah.,34
30977,KRAMER, It's Keith.,34
30978,JERRY, All right we're coming down.,34

30981,GEORGE, Where are you goin?,34
30982,ELAINE, He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?,34
30983,JERRY, That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.,34
30984,GEORGE, What the hell are you two talking about? ,34
30985,JERRY," Well that was really fun, thanks.",34
30986,KEITH," Yeah, it really was.",34
30987,JERRY, Should I shake his hand?,34
30988,JERRY," Well, ...",34
30989,KEITH," UH, do you want to catch a movie this weekend? Have you seen JFK?",34
30990,JERRY," No, I haven't.",34

30993,JERRY," Damn, I was too overanxious, he must have noticed that.",34

31309,JERRY,"Do you think that the people at the airport that run the stores have any idea what the prices are every place else in the world? Or do you think they just feel they have their own little country out there and they can charge anything they want? You're hungry? Tuna sandwich is nine dollars. You don't like it; go back to your own country. I think the whole airport airline complex is a huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches. I think that profit is what's supporting the whole air travel industry. I mean think about it; the terminals, the airplanes, it's all just a distraction so that you don't notice the beating that you're taking on the tuna.",36

31328,JERRY, So you have no car?,36
31329,GEORGE, No.,36
31330,JERRY, So what good are you?,36
31331,JERRY," I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.",36
31332,GEORGE, How do you know?,36
31333,JERRY," He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.",36
31334,GEORGE, We should take his limo.,36
31335,JERRY," Yeah, right.",36
31336,GEORGE," Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.",36
31337,JERRY, He's definitely in Chicago.,36
31338,GEORGE, Well the guy's just standing there.,36
31339,JERRY, How would we do it?,36
31340,GEORGE," We just go up to him, we say, ""We're O'Brien.""",36
31341,JERRY, Maybe he knows O'Brien?,36
31342,GEORGE," No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.",36
31343,JERRY, What if we get caught?,36
31344,GEORGE, What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.,36
31345,JERRY, Who's gonna be O'Brien?,36
31346,GEORGE, I'll be O'Brien.,36
31347,JERRY, Who am I?,36
31348,GEORGE, You're you.,36
31349,JERRY, Just me?,36
31350,GEORGE, Yeah.,36
31351,JERRY, Okay.,36
31352,GEORGE," What, you don't want to be you?",36
31353,JERRY," Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?",36
31354,GEORGE, Like who?,36
31355,JERRY, Dylan Murphy.,36
31356,JERRY," What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?",36
31357,GEORGE, Well I like Dylan.,36
31358,JERRY, You could be Colin.,36
31359,GEORGE, Colin O'Brien.,36
31360,JERRY, I'm Dylan Murphy.,36
31361,GEORGE, I'm Colin O'Brien.,36
31362,GEORGE, Are we really doing this?,36
31363,JERRY," Come on,",36
31364,MAN,"  Hey, do you have the time?",36
31365,GEORGE, Clock over there.  O'Brien.,36
31366,CHAUFFEUR, Yes sir.,36
31367,GEORGE, Sorry we're late.,36
31368,CHAUFFEUR, Here let me take that for you.,36
31369,GEORGE, Oh thank you.,36
31370,CHAUFFEUR, I'll get the car and I'll bring it around front.,36
31371,GEORGE, Thank you very much. Dylan?,36
31372,JERRY, Colin?,36
31373,GEORGE, This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.,36
31374,JERRY, What for?,36
31375,GEORGE," I dunno, I'm in a limo.  Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!",36
31376,JERRY, She happy for you?,36
31377,GEORGE, Can he hear us?,36
31378,JERRY, No. Why?,36
31379,GEORGE, I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.,36
31380,JERRY, He can't hear us.,36
31381,GEORGE," Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.",36
31382,JERRY, Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?,36
31383,GEORGE," We'll ask him.  My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?",36
31384,CHAUFFEUR," Madison Square Garden, of course. I have the four passes.",36
31385,GEORGE," Of course, the uh, the four passes.  Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!",36
31386,JERRY, What?,36
31387,GEORGE, We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!,36
31388,JERRY, We're going to the Knick game!,36
31389,GEORGE, Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!,36
31390,JERRY, I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!,36
31391,GEORGE," You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?",36
31392,JERRY, Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.,36
31393,GEORGE," If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'",36
31394,JERRY," Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye.  'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.",36
31395,CHAUFFEUR, I know.,36
31396,GEORGE, Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?,36
31397,JERRY, Maybe it's a shortcut.,36
31398,GEORGE," We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.",36
31399,JERRY,"  'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?",36
31400,CHAUFFEUR, Pick up the other members of your party.,36
31401,GEORGE," Right. The other members of our party.  Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.",36
31402,JERRY," It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.",36
31403,GEORGE, It was a good jig.,36
31404,JERRY," It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.",36
31405,GEORGE, There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.,36
31406,JERRY," First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.",36
31407,GEORGE, Well you should have been O'Brien.,36
31408,JERRY, I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?,36
31409,GEORGE," Yes, you have to be Murphy.",36
31410,JERRY," It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.",36
31411,GEORGE, You're Murphy!,36
31412,JERRY, I'm Seinfeld!,36
31413,GEORGE," You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.",36
31414,JERRY, We're doing sixty miles an hour!,36
31415,GEORGE," So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.",36
31416,JERRY," Who are you, Mannix?",36
31417,GEORGE, We're slowing down. Are those the people?,36
31418,JERRY," Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.",36
31419,WOMAN,  Mr. O'Brien?,36
31420,JERRY," No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.",36
31421,EVA,"  Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather excited to meet him face to face, finally. We're faithful readers of his newsletter.",36
31422,JERRY, Newsletter?,36
31423,TIM," And of course, his great book, ""The Game"".",36
31424,JERRY," Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?",36
31425,EVA, No.,36
31426,JERRY, Never seen a picture of him?,36
31427,EVA, Never.,36
31428,JERRY, Not even on the book jacket?,36
31429,EVA, There was no picture on the book jacket.,36
31430,JERRY,"  Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.",36
31431,GEORGE, Hello. I'm O'Brien.,36
31432,KRAMER, Hey!,36
31433,ELAINE, Hey!,36
31434,KRAMER," What, you took a cab?",36
31435,ELAINE, Yeah? So?,36
31436,KRAMER, How much do you make?,36
31437,ELAINE, I'm not telling you.,36
31438,KRAMER, C'mon.,36
31439,ELAINE, No!,36
31440,KRAMER, I'll tell you how much I make.,36
31441,ELAINE," I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.",36
31442,KRAMER, You ever seen Michael Jordan?,36
31443,ELAINE, Just in those commercials.,36
31444,KRAMER, Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.,36
31445,ELAINE, What's that?,36
31446,KRAMER," Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.",36
31447,ELAINE, Huh?,36
31448,KRAMER, Yeah.,36
31449,JERRY,  I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.,36
31450,TIM, You think someone's been tipped off?,36
31451,GEORGE," So, um, you've read ""The Big Game"", have you?",36
31452,EVA,  Yes I've read it and I've memorized it.,36
31453,GEORGE," Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of ""The Big Game"".",36
31454,EVA," Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The way you analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left me breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man.",36
31455,GEORGE," Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.",36
31456,TIM," Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.",36
31457,GEORGE," Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.",36
31458,JERRY, He tends to exaggerate.,36
31459,GEORGE," Okay, I mean it's serious but--",36
31460,EVA, We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.,36
31461,GEORGE," Uh, my speech?",36
31462,EVA," Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it over?",36
31463,JERRY, Well you might as well look it over.,36
31464,KRAMER," So what's going on, how did all this happen?",36
31465,ELAINE, Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.,36
31466,KRAMER, Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.,36
31467,ELAINE, He did.,36
31468,KRAMER, Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?,36
31469,ELAINE, I don't know.,36
31470,KRAMER, That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?,36
31471,ELAINE," Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.",36
31472,KRAMER, O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?,36
31473,GEORGE, ...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.,36
31474,JERRY," You're not going to open with that, are you?",36
31475,EVA, What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?,36
31476,GEORGE, I said so many things.,36
31477,GEORGE, They're shooting! They're shooting!,36
31478,TIM,"  Alright, get down!",36
31479,GEORGE," That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.",36
31480,EVA, But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything.,36
31481,TIM," Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.",36
31482,JERRY, Nice looking Lugar.,36
31483,JODI," I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio.",36
31484,KRAMER," Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?",36
31485,DAN, Elaine?,36
31486,ELAINE," Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?",36
31487,DAN, Good.,36
31488,ELAINE," Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.",36
31489,DAN," Oh, Kramer?",36
31490,ELAINE, What's going on?,36
31491,DAN," Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come.",36
31492,ELAINE," Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.",36
31493,DAN," Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door.",36
31494,ELAINE," Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.",36
31495,DAN," Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like.",36
31496,KRAMER, Who?,36
31497,DAN, The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien.,36
31498,JERRY, What's taking him so long out there?,36
31499,GEORGE, Didja see the way she was looking at me?,36
31500,JERRY," She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!",36
31501,GEORGE," I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.",36
31502,JERRY," Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?",36
31503,GEORGE, I don't know.,36
31504,JERRY, Let's just make a run for it.,36
31505,GEORGE," I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.",36
31506,JERRY, How'd that happen?,36
31507,GEORGE, I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.,36
31508,JERRY," I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.",36
31509,GEORGE," For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.",36
31510,GEORGE," 9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--",36
31511,GEORGE," --Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.",36
31512,TIM, We'll be ready in a minute.,36
31513,GEORGE," Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.",36
31514,TIM," With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.",36
31515,GEORGE," Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?",36
31516,TIM, You are.,36
31517,GEORGE, And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?,36
31518,TIM, You are.,36
31519,GEORGE, Good. I think you forgot something.,36
31520,TIM, I'm sorry.,36
31521,GEORGE, Good. Now get out.,36
31522,GEORGE," Okay, what are we gonna do?",36
31523,JERRY, I don't know.,36
31524,GEORGE," Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.",36
31525,JERRY, Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.,36
31526,KRAMER," I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.",36
31527,ELAINE, I'm sure he was just joking around.,36
31528,KRAMER," Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!",36
31529,ELAINE, What is it?,36
31530,KRAMER," Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!",36
31531,ELAINE, Jerry's a nazi?!,36
31532,KRAMER, I can't believe I didn't see it.,36
31533,ELAINE," Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.",36
31534,KRAMER, You don't think so.,36
31535,ELAINE," No, he's just neat.",36
31536,TIM, You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.,36
31537,GEORGE, Me??,36
31538,TIM, And you really don't look like a Murphy.,36
31539,JERRY, I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.,36
31540,GEORGE, He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.,36
31541,TIM, Where are you from?,36
31542,JERRY," Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.",36
31543,TIM, Sounds more like Scottish.,36
31544,JERRY, We were right on the border.,36
31545,KRAMER, Maybe he's with the company.,36
31546,ELAINE, What?,36
31547,KRAMER, The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.,36
31548,ELAINE, What about his comedy act?,36
31549,KRAMER," That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.",36
31550,ELAINE, What about George?,36
31551,KRAMER," What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!",36
31552,ELAINE, I'll bet they were even in on it.,36
31553,KRAMER," Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you.  I'm not gonna.",36
31554,ELAINE," Kramer, you're hurting me!",36
31555,GEORGE," Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.",36
31556,ELAINE, Get off of me!!,36
31557,KRAMER, O'Brien.,36
31558,ALL FOUR MEN, Let's get him!!,36
31559,GEORGE, What do I do?! What do I do?!,36
31560,JERRY, Get in the car! Get in the car!,36
31561,KRAMER,"  O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?",36
31562,TIM, Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?,36
31563,JERRY," No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.",36
31564,ELAINE, It could be very confusing.,36
31565,KRAMER, Yeah? Eva?,36
31566,EVA, It's for me.  Hello?  It's O'Brien.,36
31567,KRAMER, O'Brien? Well that's weird.,36
31568,EVA,  Who are you?,36
31569,JODI," A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.",36
31570,JODI," They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance.",36
31571,EVA, Get out!!,36
31572,ELAINE," Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!",36
31573,DAN, Elaine?,36
31574,ELAINE, Hey!,36
31575,GEORGE, I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!,36
31576,ELAINE," You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?",37
31577,JERRY, It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.,37
31578,JERRY, Oh look at this guy.,37
31579,ELAINE, What's goin' on?,37
31580,JERRY," Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.",37
31581,ELAINE, Did you get a thank you wave?,37
31582,JERRY," No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?",37
31583,JERRY, Give me that wave!,37
31584,ELAINE," Jerry, are you free on Friday?",37
31585,JERRY," Yeah, I'm free, why?",37
31586,ELAINE," Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.",37
31587,JERRY," Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!",37
31588,ELAINE, You gotta follow that car!,37
31589,JERRY, What?,37
31590,ELAINE, You can't let him get away with that!,37
31591,JERRY," Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.",37
31592,ELAINE," What are you, yellow?",37
31593,JERRY, I'm not yella. ,37
31594,ELAINE," Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.",37
31595,JERRY," Wait, he stopped, he's parking.",37
31596,ELAINE, What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?,37
31597,JERRY," Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.",37
31598,JERRY, So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.,37
31599,GEORGE, Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.,37
31600,JERRY," You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.",37
31601,JERRY," He, he, he. ",37
31602,GEORGE, I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?,37
31603,JERRY, Let's not even analyze it.,37
31604,GEORGE, So you didn't turn her in?,37
31605,JERRY, I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.,37
31606,GEORGE, Gonna see her again?,37
31607,JERRY, Friday night.,37
31608,JERRY, Yep.,37
31609,ELAINE, It's me!,37
31610,JERRY, Come on up.,37
31611,JERRY," By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.",37
31612,GEORGE," Hey, hey, hey! I dig.",37
31613,JERRY," Oh, you dig?",37
31614,GEORGE, Yes! I see enormous potential here.,37
31615,JERRY, Why?,37
31616,GEORGE, Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.,37
31617,JERRY, I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.,37
31618,GEORGE, I don't think so.,37
31619,JERRY," Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!",37
31620,JERRY," On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!",37
31621,JERRY," What am I drinking, milk?",37
31622,ELAINE, Hey!,37
31623,JERRY, Hi.,37
31624,ELAINE, Sweater.,37
31625,JERRY, Thank you.,37
31626,ELAINE, So? What happened?,37
31627,JERRY, With that?,37
31628,ELAINE, With the car!,37
31629,JERRY, What car?,37
31630,ELAINE, The hit and run!,37
31631,JERRY," Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.",37
31632,ELAINE, Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?,37
31633,JERRY, Over the bridge. ,37
31634,GEORGE," Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.",37
31635,JERRY," Yeah, Queens.",37
31636,ELAINE, So? Then what?,37
31637,JERRY," So he gets out of the car, I say, ""Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!"" So he says to me, ""What are ya gonna do about it?""",37
31638,JERRY," So I said to him, ""Whatever's necessary.""",37
31639,ELAINE, I am speechless. I am without speech.,37
31640,GEORGE, Tell her about the shoving.,37
31641,JERRY, What?,37
31642,ELAINE, What shoving?!,37
31643,JERRY," Oh, it was nothing.",37
31644,GEORGE, No! Tell her.,37
31645,ELAINE, You know karate??,37
31646,JERRY, I know a little.,37
31647,ELAINE," Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?",37
31648,JERRY, He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.,37
31649,KRAMER, Hey! ,37
31650,ELAINE, Did you tell Kramer?,37
31651,JERRY," Ah, nah! ",37
31652,KRAMER, What? What? What? Tell me.,37
31653,ELAINE," Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.",37
31654,KRAMER," Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. ",37
31655,KRAMER, They should be sent to Australia.,37
31656,JERRY, Australia?,37
31657,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.",37
31658,JERRY, But not anymore.,37
31659,KRAMER, No.,37
31660,ELAINE," Hey Kramer, Kramer!",37
31661,KRAMER, Yeah?,37
31662,ELAINE, What happened to you right here? ,37
31663,KRAMER, I don't know!,37
31664,KRAMER," You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.",37
31665,ELAINE," Well, that is, that is strange.",37
31666,KRAMER, Yep. ,37
31667,ELAINE," Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?",37
31668,JERRY," Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.",37
31669,ELAINE, But last night you said you were free! ,37
31670,JERRY, We just met.,37
31671,KRAMER, Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.,37
31672,ELAINE," But I, I can't go alone!",37
31673,JERRY, Ask George to go with you.,37
31674,ELAINE," George, come on! I'll pay for you.",37
31675,GEORGE, You'll pay? I'm there.,37
31676,JERRY, Why do you even need anybody?,37
31677,ELAINE," Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. ",37
31678,ROBIN, You went out with a bullfighter?,37
31679,ELAINE," Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.",37
31680,MICHAEL, Wow.,37
31681,ROBIN, What was his name?,37
31682,ELAINE," His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.",37
31683,GEORGE, Pass the salt please.,37
31684,ROBIN, Where did you meet him?,37
31685,ELAINE," Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.",37
31686,GEORGE, Bread.,37
31687,ELAINE, I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.,37
31688,GEORGE, God bless you.,37
31689,ROBIN, Thank you.,37
31690,GEORGE," I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. ",37
31691,WOMAN, You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.,37
31692,JERRY," Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.",37
31693,WOMAN, Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?,37
31694,JERRY, Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.,37
31695,WOMAN, Come here. ,37
31696,ROBIN, He was only joking Michael.,37
31697,MICHAEL, You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?,37
31698,GEORGE," No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.",37
31699,ROBIN, He was only joking Michael! Sorry.,37
31700,MICHAEL, All right! Take his side!,37
31701,ROBIN, I am not taking his side.,37
31702,MICHAEL, Well who's side are you taking?!,37
31703,ROBIN, Well I'm not taking your side!,37
31704,JERRY," Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.",37
31705,GEORGE, I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?,37
31706,JERRY," The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.",37
31707,ELAINE, It's me.,37
31708,JERRY, Come on up.,37
31709,GEORGE," Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this",37
31710,JERRY," No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.",37
31711,GEORGE," Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.",37
31712,JERRY, What if she's having an off night?,37
31713,ELAINE, Hi!,37
31714,JERRY, Hi.,37
31715,ELAINE, Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!,37
31716,GEORGE," Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.",37
31717,GEORGE," Ah, shut up.",37
31718,ELAINE, What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.,37
31719,JERRY, A stupid what?,37
31720,ELAINE, Whatever.,37
31721,JERRY," You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.",37
31722,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.",37
31723,GEORGE, Who?,37
31724,ELAINE, Robin!,37
31725,GEORGE, Why?!,37
31726,ELAINE," Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.",37
31727,JERRY, Entertainment Tonight's on.,37
31728,GEORGE, Where's the remote phone?,37
31729,JERRY, Bedroom.,37
31730,ELAINE," Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?",37
31731,JERRY, What's it like out?,37
31732,ELAINE, Chilly out.,37
31733,JERRY, Can I take a sweater?,37
31734,ELAINE," Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.",37
31735,JERRY, Scarf?,37
31736,ELAINE," Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.",37
31737,JERRY, What's the matter? What's going on?,37
31738,KRAMER, What happened?!,37
31739,ELAINE, What?,37
31740,KRAMER, I think I hit my head again!,37
31741,JERRY, What is wrong?!,37
31742,ELAINE," Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?",37
31743,KRAMER, Yeah.,37
31744,ELAINE, That is it!,37
31745,KRAMER, What?,37
31746,ELAINE," That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!",37
31747,KRAMER, Mary Hart!,37
31748,GEORGE, God.,37
31749,ELAINE, What?,37
31750,GEORGE," Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.",37
31751,JERRY, Get together?,37
31752,GEORGE, Maybe she just wants to talk to me?,37
31753,ELAINE, Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.,37
31754,GEORGE," Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.",37
31755,ELAINE, Are you actually considering this?,37
31756,GEORGE," I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!",37
31757,ELAINE," Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.",37
31758,JERRY, Yeah.,37
31759,KRAMER," Hey, you know who owns that car?",37
31760,JERRY, What car?,37
31761,KRAMER, The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.,37
31762,JERRY, Yeah who?,37
31763,KRAMER," That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.",37
31764,JERRY," The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.",37
31765,ELAINE, Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.,37
31766,KRAMER," Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?",37
31767,JERRY, The blond with the blue sweatpants!,37
31768,GEORGE," Well, who is she?",37
31769,JERRY, I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.,37
31770,GEORGE," Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.",37
31771,JERRY," Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!",37
31772,GEORGE, You can't compromise your principles!,37
31773,JERRY, How am I going to live with myself?!,37
31774,GEORGE, Can't live!,37
31775,JERRY," I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!",37
31776,GEORGE, This country needs more people like you!,37
31777,JERRY," Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.",37
31778,GEORGE, I believe strongly in that as you know.,37
31779,JERRY, There should be more people like us.,37
31780,GEORGE, That's why the world's in the shape it's in.,37
31781,JERRY, You're telling me.,37
31782,JERRY," Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.",37
31783,BECKY, Well God bless you.,37
31784,JERRY, Thank you very much.,37
31785,GEORGE, Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?,37
31786,ROBIN," Oh no, what's wrong?",37
31787,GEORGE, What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!,37
31788,ROBIN," You didn't commit adultery, I did.",37
31789,GEORGE, Oh yeah.,37
31790,ROBIN," If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else.",37
31791,GEORGE," Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.",37
31792,ROBIN, Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'.,37
31793,GEORGE," Well, that's a given.",37
31794,ROBIN," In three years with Michael, not one 'God bless you'.",37
31795,GEORGE, Must be hell living in that house.,37
31796,MICHAEL," Hi, it's Michael.",37
31797,ELAINE," Hi, Michael!",37
31798,MICHAEL, Is Robin there?,37
31799,ELAINE," Robin? No, why?",37
31800,MICHAEL," Uh, she said she was going to be with you.",37
31801,ELAINE," No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.",37
31802,MICHAEL," If she's not with you, then where is she?",37
31803,ELAINE," Well I, I don't know.",37
31804,MICHAEL, Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!,37
31805,ELAINE," No, no, come on Michael!",37
31806,MICHAEL," He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break his joints, and reattach them!",37
31807,ELAINE, You're soo good lookin'.,37
31808,ANGELA," Now you listen to me, suck face! You tell anybody, anything, and I will carve my initials in your brain tissue!",37
31809,JERRY, Let me rephra-,37
31810,ANGELA," I'll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and I'll have a party on your head!",37
31811,JERRY," Hi Elaine, this is Angela.",37
31812,ANGELA, I'll pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth!,37
31813,JERRY, Well I think I get the gist of it.,37
31814,ANGELA, So you don't say anything to anybody about me hitting that car!,37
31815,JERRY, What car?,37
31816,ANGELA, Good. I'm glad we understand each other.,37
31817,JERRY, It's not complicated.,37
31818,ELAINE, Very nice meeting you!,37
31819,ELAINE, Come on up.,37
31820,ELAINE," Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.",37
31821,JERRY, Alright Elaine.,37
31822,ELAINE," No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!",37
31823,JERRY, It was just a couple of blocks.,37
31824,ELAINE," Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!",37
31825,GEORGE, Hey.,37
31826,ELAINE," Oh, did you check you machine?",37
31827,GEORGE," No, why, what's happening?",37
31828,ELAINE," Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.",37
31829,GEORGE," Yeah, okay.",37
31830,ELAINE, And I said I hadn't seen her.,37
31831,GEORGE, What?!,37
31832,ELAINE," No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.",37
31833,GEORGE, He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!,37
31834,ELAINE, He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.,37
31835,GEORGE, What? Why couldn't you think of something?!,37
31836,ELAINE," Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!",37
31837,GEORGE, You lie! How hard is it to lie?!,37
31838,JERRY, It's not that hard.,37
31839,ELAINE, Well who told you to sleep with her George?!,37
31840,GEORGE, It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!,37
31841,ELAINE, Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!,37
31842,GEORGE, Oh don't-,37
31843,JERRY, Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?,37
31844,GEORGE, She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.,37
31845,JERRY," A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?",37
31846,ELAINE," Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.",37
31847,JERRY," Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!",37
31848,JERRY," Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.",37
31849,BECKY," Well, I already got an estimate. It's $875.",37
31850,JERRY, $875?,37
31851,BECKY, That's right.,37
31852,JERRY," Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.",37
31853,JERRY," Um, who do I make it out to?",37
31854,BECKY, Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.,37
31855,JERRY," So, what are you doing this weekend?",37
31856,BECKY," You have got some nerve! You smash up my car, you don't admit it, and now you want to ask me out on a date?",37
31857,JERRY, I didn't do it!,37
31858,BECKY, Yeah righ-,37
31859,JERRY, You are soo good lookin'.,37
31860,BECKY, Thank you.,37
31861,GEORGE," Jerry, let's go! You ready?",37
31862,JERRY, You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!,37
31863,GEORGE," Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.",37
31864,JERRY, Alright!,37
31865,GEORGE, Come on let's get out of here.,37
31866,KRAMER, How could you?,37
31867,JERRY, What?!,37
31868,KRAMER, Man! I never thought you were capable of this!,37
31869,JERRY, What did I do?,37
31870,KRAMER," I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.",37
31871,JERRY, I-,37
31872,KRAMER, I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.,37
31873,JERRY, I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!,37
31874,KRAMER," Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?",37
31875,JERRY," No, never.",37
31876,KRAMER, Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.,37
31877,JERRY, You got a date with Becky Gelke?!,37
31878,KRAMER," Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.",37
31879,GEORGE," Jerry, can we get out of here?!",37
31880,KRAMER," As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.",37
31881,JERRY," Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.",37
31882,NINA,"  Kramer, would you hold still? I can’t do this if you keep moving.",38
31883,KRAMER, You sure you don’t want me to take my clothes off?  I’ll do it!,38
31884,NINA," No, that’s the last thing in the world I want you to do.",38
31885,KRAMER," Well, why don’t you take your clothes off?",38
31886,NINA, I don’t know... I don’t think Jerry would like that.,38
31887,KRAMER,"  Well, it’d be our little secret.",38
31888,GEORGE,  Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!,38
31889,JERRY, I like the button fly.,38
31890,GEORGE,  What?,38
31891,JERRY, That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. It’s like a mink trap down there.  What are you doing today?,38
31892,GEORGE, Nothing.,38
31893,JERRY," I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?",38
31894,GEORGE, I don’t get art.,38
31895,JERRY, There’s nothing to get.,38
31896,GEORGE," Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.",38
31897,JERRY, She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.,38
31898,GEORGE, What for?,38
31899,JERRY, She sees something in him.,38
31900,GEORGE," So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.",38
31901,KRAMER," Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown.  Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.",38
31902,NINA, Tell me about Elaine.,38
31903,KRAMER," She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.",38
31904,NINA," But, they're still friends.",38
31905,KRAMER," Oh yeah, they're like this .",38
31906,NINA, Don't you think that's strange?,38
31907,KRAMER," Why, what's the difference?",38
31908,NINA," Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?",38
31909,KRAMER," Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.",38
31910,GEORGE," You know, I'm a little nervous.",38
31911,JERRY, Why?,38
31912,GEORGE," Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.",38
31913,JERRY, I don't know how long this is gonna last.,38
31914,GEORGE, Really? I thought you liked her.,38
31915,JERRY, I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. ,38
31916,GEORGE," You know, it's a miracle you're not married.  Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?",38
31917,JERRY," Hi, Nina.  This is my friend George.",38
31918,NINA," How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. ",38
31919,JERRY,"  Hey, look at this guy!",38
31920,KRAMER, Yeah!,38
31921,JERRY,  I brought George up to see some of your paintings.,38
31922,NINA," Oh, are you interested?",38
31923,GEORGE,"  Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.",38
31924,KRAMER," George, you gonna buy a painting?",38
31925,GEORGE,"  Yeah, sure.",38
31926,NINA, Are you an art-lover?,38
31927,GEORGE, I am an art-adorer! I adore art.,38
31928,NINA," Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like. ",38
31929,JERRY, May I? ,38
31930,NINA,"  Get outta here!  Here, play with this. ",38
31931,JERRY, What's this?,38
31932,NINA," My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout.",38
31933,JERRY,"  Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.",38
31934,NINA," Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?",38
31935,KRAMER,  Yeah.,38
31936,JERRY," They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!",38
31937,GEORGE," Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?",38
31938,NINA," Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.",38
31939,GEORGE," All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!",38
31940,NINA,  You like that one?,38
31941,GEORGE, Look at where we are!  He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going!  We're not in the first row?,38
31942,USHER," No, no, these are your seats.",38
31943,GEORGE, She said first row! Right behind the dugout!,38
31944,ELAINE," Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.",38
31945,GEORGE, I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!,38
31946,ELAINE, Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.,38
31947,GEORGE," Oh, there's better,  right there, that's better.",38
31948,KRAMER," Right.  Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? What a great day!",38
31949,ELAINE, I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.,38
31950,GEORGE,  You're supposed to do that?,38
31951,ELAINE,  Yeah.  What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?,38
31952,GEORGE, I'd rather go to a hanging.,38
31953,ELAINE," Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. ",38
31954,KRAMER,"  YOU BETTER CATCH IT,",38
31955,MAN, George?,38
31956,GEORGE, Yeah?,38
31957,MAN," Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father.",38

31959,ELAINE, Hi!,38
31960,KRAMER,"  HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!",38
31961,GEORGE, --and this is Kramer.,38
31962,KRAMER," Oh, hey.",38
31963,WEST, So how are the seats?,38
31964,GEORGE, Okay.,38
31965,ELAINE," Great, great.",38
31966,KRAMER, Yeah.,38
31967,WEST," George, I heard you bought one of Nina's paintings.",38
31968,GEORGE," Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs.  Not, uh, too expensive, is it?",38
31969,WEST," Well, if you have a lot of money.",38
31970,WEST,"  Well, enjoy the game.  I think you better take off that Orioles cap.",38
31971,ELAINE,  Yeah. I better!,38
31972,WEST," No, no, no. Seriously. You're in the owner's box, and I don't think it's a good idea.",38
31973,ELAINE, You're not serious.,38
31974,WEST," Yes, yes, yes, I am!",38
31975,ELAINE," Well, did he say that?",38
31976,WEST," No, no, but he gave me the seats. I don't think he'd like it if you wore an Orioles cap.",38
31977,ELAINE, Well maybe you should ask him!,38
31978,WEST, I don't have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or not?,38
31979,ELAINE," No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!",38
31980,GEORGE, Just take the cap off.,38
31981,ELAINE," George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!",38
31982,WEST," Look. Either you take the cap off, or you'll have to leave.",38
31983,ELAINE," Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.",38
31984,GEORGE, Just take the cap off!,38
31985,ELAINE, No!,38
31986,KRAMER, Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!,38
31987,GEORGE,  Do you want us to go with you?,38
31988,KRAMER,"  I'll go get your hat, George.",38
31989,ELAINE,  Stay!,38
31990,GEORGE," Okay, we'll go!",38
31991,ELAINE, ...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!,38
31992,JERRY, Is he okay?,38
31993,ELAINE," Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative.  It was quite a day!",38
31994,JERRY, This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!,38
31995,ELAINE, I know! Can you imagine that?,38
31996,JERRY, How you feeling?,38
31997,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.  Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.",38

32004,KRAMER," Yup, yup!",38
32005,ELAINE, Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!,38
32006,ELAINE," Hi, Mr. Lippman.",38
32007,LIPPMAN,How's your father?,38
32008,ELAINE," My, my father?",38
32009,LIPPMAN,"Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?",38

32011,LIPPMAN,Uh-huh.,38
32012,ELAINE, I went to visit him.,38
32013,LIPPMAN,"Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?",38
32014,ELAINE," Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...",38
32015,LIPPMAN,But--but he's feeling better now?,38
32016,ELAINE," Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed  his spirits.",38
32017,LIPPMAN, Boo-eed.,38
32018,ELAINE, What--what did I say?,38
32019,LIPPMAN,"You said ""boyed.""",38
32020,ELAINE, I did?,38
32021,LIPPMAN,Yeah.,38
32022,LIPPMAN,"Well, I got a plane to catch.",38
32023,ELAINE, Oh! Where are you going?,38
32024,LIPPMAN,Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention.  Can I have my sports section?,38
32025,ELAINE, Ah. ...Yeah.,38
32026,LIPPMAN,I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports section.,38
32027,ELAINE," There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...",38
32028,LIPPMAN,"Right, right.  What, what are you doing?",38
32029,ELAINE," Wha-- oh!  Oh, god!  That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH!  Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... ",38
32030,LIPPMAN,Gotta go.,38
32031,ELAINE," Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty!  I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!",38
32032,MRS.ARM,"I sense great vulcrability. A land child crying out for love, an innocent orphan in the post-modern world.",38
32033,MR. ARM,I see a parasite.,38
32034,MRS.ARM,"A sexually-depraved miscrient, who is seeking to gratify only his most basic and immediate urges.",38
32035,NINA, She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.,38
32036,JERRY, It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game.  How can you defend that?,38
32037,MRS.ARM,"He is struggled, he is man-struggled. He lifts my spirit!",38
32038,MR. ARM,"He is a loathsome, offensive brute, yet I can't look away.",38
32039,JERRY," Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.",38
32040,NINA," Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!",38
32041,JERRY," Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!",38
32042,NINA," Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500!",38
32043,MRS.ARM,He transcends time and space.,38
32044,MR. ARM,He sickens me.,38
32045,MRS.ARM,I love it.,38
32046,MR. ARM,Me too.,38
32047,GEORGE, Five-hundred dollars?! What?,38
32048,JERRY, That's what she told me!,38
32049,GEORGE, I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!,38
32050,JERRY, That's what it costs!,38
32051,GEORGE, Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!,38
32052,JERRY, I wasn't thinking! I don't know.,38
32053,GEORGE, You weren't thinking.,38
32054,JERRY," Well, she framed it and everything.",38
32055,GEORGE," Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this!  I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines!  Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?",38
32056,JERRY, Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!,38
32057,GEORGE," I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.",38
32058,KRAMER,  This was in front of your door.,38
32059,GEORGE," Hey, Kramer.",38
32060,KRAMER," Hi, Mike.",38
32061,JERRY,"  Wow, a letter from Nina!",38

32064,GEORGE, What?,38
32065,JERRY," This is amazing, you can't believe this!",38
32066,GEORGE, What's it say?,38
32067,JERRY, Listen to this,38
32068,GEORGE, WOW!,38
32069,KRAMER,  She's deep.,38
32070,JERRY,"  ""...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-""",38
32071,KRAMER," You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!",38
32072,JERRY, No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!,38
32073,KRAMER,  Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!,38
32074,JERRY, Should I?,38
32075,KRAMER,"  YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD!  Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!",38
32076,JERRY," ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.",38

32078,GEORGE,  It's George.,38
32079,JERRY," Come on up.  Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.",38
32080,NINA, What's the appeal of the posse?,38
32081,JERRY," The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.",38
32082,NINA," Hello, George.",38
32083,GEORGE," Hey, Nina!  I owe you some money, don't I?",38
32084,NINA," Well, I really love that piece.",38
32085,GEORGE," Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.",38
32086,NINA," No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!",38
32087,GEORGE, This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.,38
32088,NINA," Honestly, George, the money's not important.",38
32089,GEORGE, Who said anything about money? ,38
32090,JERRY, Yeah?,38
32091,ELAINE,  It's Elaine.,38
32092,JERRY, Come on up.,38
32093,NINA, Elaine?,38
32094,JERRY, ...Yeah.,38
32095,NINA,"  This person does not believe in telephones, does she?",38
32096,JERRY," She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in.  He likes the pop-in, too.",38
32097,GEORGE, I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.,38

32109,ELAINE," No, he wants to torture me.",38
32110,ELAINE,  Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! ,38
32111,JERRY,  I'm a great clicker!  Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.,38
32112,ELAINE, You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.,38

32121,JERRY,"  Wait a second... wait a second!!  The letter, that's the letter!",38
32122,ELAINE, What letter?,38
32123,JERRY," This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!",38
32124,JERRY," ""...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!""",38
32125,GEORGE, This is incredible!,38
32126,JERRY," I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!",38
32127,GEORGE, Maybe I won't send her that check.,38
32128,ELAINE," You know, it's not really that terrible.",38
32129,JERRY, What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself!  I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!,38
32130,LIPPMAN,"...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap off?  But didn't she know they were the owner's seats?  Aw, that's unbelievable.  Yeah. Okay. Alright Lenny, thanks again. Take care.  That was Lenny West, my accountant, who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees too; it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they throw him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter. She's an artist, by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives 'em to some friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore cap!  You're from Baltimore, right?",38
32131,ELAINE," Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.",38
32132,LIPPMAN,"Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?",38
32133,ELAINE," Well, uh, fan. My father--",38
32134,LIPPMAN,"Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!",38
32135,ELAINE, Really?,38
32136,LIPPMAN,Yeah.,38
32137,ELAINE, So... impudent.,38
32138,LIPPMAN,"Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. I'm inviting Frank and Marsha. 'Wantcha to come.",38
32139,ELAINE,"  Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--",38
32140,LIPPMAN,"Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the game.",38
32141,ELAINE,  Okay.,38
32142,LIPPMAN,Good.  Oh--and Elaine. You know the Baltimore cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little fun with him.,38
32143,ELAINE, That will be fun.,38
32144,JERRY, How's it coming?,38
32145,NINA," Good, good.",38
32146,JERRY, Seen any good movies lately?,38
32147,NINA, No... not really. You?,38
32148,JERRY," No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?",38
32149,NINA," Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.",38
32150,JERRY," I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?",38
32151,NINA, I don't know... maybe.,38
32152,JERRY," I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it.  I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- ",38
32153,MR. ARM,"Well, we've made our decision. We want ""The Kramer.""",38
32154,GEORGE, Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? ,38
32155,JERRY," Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!",38
32156,GEORGE, So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?,38
32157,JERRY," Yeah.  And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?",38
32158,GEORGE," Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.",38
32159,TVVOICE," Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the Yankee dugout.",38
32160,GEORGE," Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.",38
32161,TVVOICE," Well, we're not going to show it, we don't want to encourage that kind of behavior. Say, it's a young lady, and boy she's really going at it with the security guard. She's a fiesty one. And now they're getting the other security guard to come down. How do you like that Seegers? Boy, she's someting.  And a ball to left field...""",38
32162,KRAMER," ...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden.  This steak is excellent, by the way.",38

32165,MR. ARM,"Yes, yes. Go on. You hopped a steamship to Sweden?",38
32166,KRAMER," Yeah.  And, it was a big one.",38
32167,KRAMER," Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.",39
32168,JERRY, What are you talking about?,39
32169,KRAMER," Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?",39
32170,JERRY, Yeah.,39
32171,KRAMER," Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.",39
32172,JERRY," Oh yeah, I know.",39
32173,KRAMER," Well, where is it?",39
32174,JERRY, What's the difference?,39
32175,KRAMER," Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.",39
32176,JERRY," You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?",39
32177,KRAMER, What happened to the car?,39
32178,JERRY," If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?",39
32179,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.",39
32180,JERRY," You have to know, you must know.",39
32181,KRAMER, I must know.,39
32182,JERRY," Well, I'm not telling you.",39
32183,KRAMER," Oh, come on.",39
32184,JERRY, Nope. I don't think so.,39
32185,KRAMER," Well, please?",39
32186,JERRY," Not today, pal.",39
32187,KRAMER," Okay, I beg you.",39
32188,JERRY, Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.,39
32189,KRAMER," Okay, please! Please tell me!",39
32190,JERRY," Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.",39
32191,KRAMER," Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.",39
32192,JERRY, I loaned the car to George.,39
32193,KRAMER," Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?",39
32194,JERRY," George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!",39
32195,KRAMER, Alright.,39
32196,JERRY, Huh?,39
32197,KRAMER," Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?",39
32198,JERRY, Will you stop it already?!,39
32199,KRAMER," You know, why didn't they ask me to go?",39
32200,JERRY, I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!,39
32201,KRAMER," What, they don't like me?",39
32202,JERRY, *I* don't like you!,39
32203,KRAMER," If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.",39
32204,GEORGE, I really think it looks good.,39
32205,ELAINE," Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?",39
32206,GEORGE, All bald people look good in hats.,39
32207,ELAINE," You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.",39
32208,GEORGE, What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.,39
32209,ELAINE," Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?",39
32210,GEORGE," No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.",39
32211,ELAINE, Are you sure you like these sunglasses?,39
32212,KRAMER, Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.,39
32213,JERRY, Why not?,39
32214,KRAMER," Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems.  Oh, is this for the fight?",39
32215,JERRY, Yep.  Starts in thirty-five minutes.,39
32216,KRAMER," Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?",39
32217,JERRY," No, I like Mike.",39
32218,KRAMER," Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.",39
32219,JERRY, Oh yeah? What did you talk about?,39
32220,KRAMER, Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.,39
32221,JERRY, Oh yeah? What did he say?,39
32222,KRAMER," You have to know everything, don't you?",39
32223,JERRY," No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?",39
32224,KRAMER, Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?,39
32225,JERRY," Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.",39
32226,KRAMER, Beg me.,39
32227,JERRY," Please, don't make me beg.",39
32228,KRAMER," No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.",39
32229,JERRY," Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.",39
32230,KRAMER," No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...",39
32231,JERRY, Kramer!,39
32232,KRAMER," Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.",39
32233,JERRY, Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.,39
32234,KRAMER, Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.,39
32235,JERRY," I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!",39
32236,KRAMER, He thinks you're a phony.,39
32237,JERRY, He what?,39
32238,KRAMER," I told you, he thinks you're a phony.",39
32239,JERRY, A phony? He called me a phony?,39
32240,KRAMER, A big phone. A big one.,39
32241,JERRY, Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!,39
32242,KRAMER, You begged me.,39
32243,GEORGE, Do you hear that?,39
32244,ELAINE, Of course I hear that.,39
32245,GEORGE, You had to move the mirror?,39
32246,ELAINE, I wanted to check out my sunglasses.,39
32247,GEORGE," I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.",39
32248,ELAINE," Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.",39
32249,GEORGE, I can't drive?,39
32250,ELAINE, Yeah.,39
32251,GEORGE," Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.",39
32252,ELAINE," No, I really don't.",39
32253,GEORGE, And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.,39
32254,ELAINE, I'm sure you could.,39
32255,GEORGE, What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?,39
32256,ELAINE, I don't know.,39
32257,GEORGE," Alright, start looking for spaces.",39
32258,ELAINE," Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.",39
32259,GEORGE," Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.",39
32260,ELAINE," Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.",39
32261,GEORGE, I can't park in a garage.,39
32262,ELAINE, Why?,39
32263,GEORGE," I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.",39
32264,ELAINE, I'll pay for it.,39
32265,GEORGE," You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free?  What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.",39
32266,ELAINE,"  Oh George, there's a space right there!",39
32267,GEORGE,"  Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?",39
32268,ELAINE, You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.,39
32269,GEORGE," Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking.  How I wish you could make a living parallel parking.  It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.",39
32270,ELAINE, Will you just park it already?,39
32271,GEORGE," There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on.  Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!",39
32272,ELAINE," George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.",39
32273,GEORGE," No no no, he's not getting away with this.",39
32274,ELAINE, George?,39
32275,GEORGE," Hey, what are you doing?",39
32276,MIKE, I think I'm parking my car.,39
32277,GEORGE," You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.",39
32278,MIKE," I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.",39
32279,GEORGE," Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?",39
32280,MIKE," Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in.",39
32281,GEORGE, I was in the middle of a conversation.,39
32282,MIKE," Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?",39
32283,GEORGE, The point is I was here first.,39
32284,MIKE, I was closer to this space than you were.,39
32285,GEORGE, But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!,39
32286,MIKE, I can if I have room!,39
32287,GEORGE, Are you gonna move the car?,39
32288,MIKE," No, I'm not gonna move the car.",39
32289,GEORGE, Jerk!,39
32290,MIKE," Oh, you're not?",39
32291,GEORGE, Do you believe this guy?,39
32292,ELAINE," Come on, we'll put it in a garage.",39
32293,GEORGE," I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.",39
32294,ELAINE," What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.",39
32295,GEORGE, Are you coming back down?,39
32296,ELAINE," Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.",39
32297,GEORGE," Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?",39
32298,ELAINE," Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.",39
32299,GEORGE," Oh, come on, you're good at this.",39
32300,ELAINE, What am I gonna say?,39
32301,GEORGE," I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.",39
32302,ELAINE," Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?",39
32303,JERRY," Yeah, under the counter. What happened?",39
32304,ELAINE," Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home.  You wouldn't believe it. ",39
32305,JERRY,  Tell me what happened.,39
32306,ELAINE,"  Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.",39
32307,JERRY, He is?,39
32308,ELAINE," Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.",39
32309,JERRY, A gun?!,39
32310,ELAINE," I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.",39
32311,JERRY," My god, are you okay?",39
32312,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.",39
32313,JERRY," Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.",39
32314,ELAINE, Exactly.,39
32315,JERRY, Where's George now?,39
32316,ELAINE," Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.",39
32317,JERRY, What are you talking about?,39
32318,ELAINE," Look out the window, you'll see.",39
32319,JERRY,  Hey Georgie!,39
32320,GEORGE, Hey!,39
32321,JERRY, Are you okay?,39
32322,GEORGE," Yeah, I'm fine.",39
32323,JERRY," Crazy kids, huh?",39
32324,GEORGE, What?,39
32325,ELAINE,  Ow!!  It's my cuticle.,39
32326,MIKE, Is that Jerry? Jerry?!,39
32327,JERRY," Oh, hey Mike.",39
32328,GEORGE," What, you know Jerry?",39
32329,MIKE," Yeah, I know Jerry.",39
32330,GEORGE, How do you know him?,39
32331,MIKE, What's the difference?,39
32332,GEORGE," Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.",39
32333,MIKE," Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!",39
32334,JERRY, I'm coming down.,39
32335,MIKE," Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?",39
32336,GEORGE," What, you know Kramer?!",39
32337,ELAINE, Hi.,39
32338,KRAMER,  Hello.,39
32339,JERRY," Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.",39
32340,KRAMER,"  Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!",39
32341,GEORGE, And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?,39
32342,MIKE, Yeah.,39
32343,GEORGE, Oh great.,39
32344,ELAINE, You know that guy downstairs?,39
32345,JERRY," Yeah, he's a real phony.",39
32346,KRAMER, What's going on?!,39
32347,MIKE," Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!",39
32348,GEORGE, It's my space!,39
32349,KRAMER, I'll be down in a minute.,39
32350,ELAINE, Are you going down?,39
32351,KRAMER, Yeah.,39
32352,ELAINE, Is anything wrong?,39
32353,KRAMER,  Why should anything be wrong?,39
32354,ELAINE,  Be down in a minute.,39
32355,MIKE," Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.",39
32356,GEORGE, I'll die out here.,39
32357,MIKE, Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!,39
32358,JERRY, Hi Mike.  Indiana.,39
32359,MIKE, Hey Krame! You know this guy?,39
32360,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, I know him.",39
32361,MIKE,  You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?,39
32362,JERRY," Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.",39
32363,MIKE,"  Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!",39
32364,GEORGE," Oh, come on.",39
32365,MIKE, Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.,39
32366,GEORGE," Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?",39
32367,MIKE," Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.",39
32368,GEORGE, You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!,39
32369,MIKE, I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!,39
32370,GEORGE, You've got a prayer.,39
32371,KRAMER, I go in front first all the time.,39
32372,JERRY," Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.",39
32373,GEORGE, Did you talk to him?,39
32374,ELAINE," Yeah, it's all taken care of.",39
32375,GEORGE, You told him? What did you tell him?,39
32376,ELAINE," I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.",39
32377,GEORGE," I don't believe it, what did you say?",39
32378,ELAINE, I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.,39
32379,GEORGE, A pack of teenagers?,39
32380,ELAINE," Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.",39
32381,GEORGE," You are a genius, it's as simple as that.",39
32382,ELAINE," What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.",39
32383,KRAMER," By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.",39
32384,ELAINE, What?,39
32385,KRAMER," Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.",39
32386,GEORGE, Oh great.,39
32387,JERRY, I didn't know.,39
32388,ELAINE," Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.",39
32389,GEORGE, Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.,39
32390,MIKE, A flea market? You went to a flea market??,39
32391,GEORGE," Hey, who's talking to you?",39
32392,ELAINE, We just didn't think of you.,39
32393,KRAMER," You said it, sister.",39
32394,GEORGE, What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?,39
32395,GEORGE," Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.",39
32396,JERRY, I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!,39
32397,GEORGE," Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.",39
32398,JERRY, You're right. My fault.,39
32399,ELAINE," Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.",39
32400,GEORGE," Yeah, I'm sorry.",39
32401,KRAMER," I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.",39
32402,GEORGE," What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?",39
32403,JERRY, It was a so-so sorry.,39
32404,TRUCK DRIVER," Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!",39
32405,GEORGE, You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.,39
32406,MIKE, And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?,39
32407,TRUCK DRIVER, Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of ice cream here!,39
32408,ELAINE," You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.",39
32409,JERRY," Wild pack of teenagers, huh?",39
32410,GEORGE, Yeah.,39
32411,JERRY," Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.",39
32412,ELAINE," Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?",39
32413,GEORGE, Uh huh.,39
32414,JERRY," Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,",39
32415,GEORGE," Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.",39
32416,ELAINE, Right.,39
32417,GEORGE, I learned a lot about myself.,39
32418,JERRY, What did you do to my car?!,39
32419,GEORGE," I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.",39
32420,ELAINE," Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.",39
32421,JERRY, I thought you said you were a good driver!,39
32422,GEORGE," No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.",39
32423,JERRY, I think you said driver.,39
32424,GEORGE," Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.",39
32425,MIKE, Will you move it up a little bit?,39
32426,GEORGE," No no no, that's in the right position.",39
32427,MIKE," No no, I was further in.",39
32428,GEORGE," No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.",39
32429,MIKE, Do you mind?,39
32430,GEORGE, Do you?,39
32431,SID," Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion.",39
32432,JERRY, Hey Sid.,39
32433,MIKE, Who are you?,39
32434,SID," Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are?  Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything gets disrupted and disjointed?",39
32435,GEORGE," Sid, it's completely his fault.",39
32436,MIKE," Oh, right.",39
32437,SID, Why don't you start taking the bus?,39
32438,JERRY," Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.",39
32439,GEORGE, Don't do it!,39
32440,JERRY," What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?",39
32441,GEORGE," Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.",39
32442,ELAINE, Why don't you just flip a coin already?,39
32443,GEORGE," No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.",39
32444,ELAINE," You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.",39
32445,GEORGE, So you're against me now?,39
32446,ANGRY MAN," He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose to go in head first.",39
32447,MATTHEW," No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in.",39
32448,ANGRY MAN, No he wasn't.,39
32449,MATTHEW, All that matters is who was there first.,39
32450,ANGRY MAN," Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke.",39
32451,MATTHEW, You just spit on me!,39
32452,ANGRY MAN, Don't you raise your voice to me!,39
32453,MATTHEW, You're not my father.,39
32454,JERRY, Hey Matthew.,39

32460,JERRY," Oh no, nothing.",39

32462,JERRY," No, no, no, no.",39
32463,MATTHEW, We're not going to have any money? We're out of money?,39
32464,JERRY," No, of course not, of course not!",39
32465,MATTHEW, Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the store. He's going out of business. We don't have any money?,39
32466,MARYEDITH, Jerry?! What's the matter with you?,39
32467,JERRY, I didn't--,39

32480,MARYEDITH," Come on, Matthew!",39
32481,KRAMER, I thought she was pregnant.,39
32482,JERRY,"  Hey, do you think I'm phony?",39
32483,ELAINE, What?,39
32484,JERRY, Mike thinks I'm a phony.,39
32485,ELAINE, He thinks you're a phony?,39
32486,JERRY," Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.",39
32487,ELAINE," Oh, you have to say something.",39
32488,JERRY," I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.",39
32489,ELAINE, You gotta open the vault.,39
32490,JERRY, Open my vault?,39
32491,ELAINE, Open your vault.,39
32492,JERRY," Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.",39
32493,ELAINE, You have no choice.,39
32494,JERRY, Oy ga-vault.,39
32495,KRAMER, When can you park head first?,39

32503,KRAMER, What about Sundays and holidays?,39
32504,GEORGE, Oh please.,39
32505,SHEILA, What's going on here?,39
32506,GEORGE," Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.",39
32507,SHEILA, I really hate people who do that. I hope you don't let him get away with it.,39
32508,GEORGE," Well, thank you for your support.",39
32509,SHEILA," Hey, that's a great hat.",39
32510,GEORGE, Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.,39
32511,NEWMAN," Hey George, nice hat.",39
32512,GEORGE," Yeah, thanks.",39
32513,NEWMAN, Can I try it on?,39
32514,GEORGE," No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.",39
32515,NEWMAN, Well sure it would.,39
32516,GEORGE," No! Get out of here, Newman.",39
32517,NEWMAN," Come on, let me try it on.",39
32518,GEORGE," No, Newman, stop it.",39
32519,SHEILA, Let him try it on.,39
32520,GEORGE, I don't want him to!,39

32522,GEORGE," You wanna see?!  There! There it is!  Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!",39
32523,NEWMAN," Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.",39
32524,GEORGE," Alright, just keep the hat!",39
32525,JERRY," Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?",39
32526,ELAINE, It depends on who's going.  Are you going?,39
32527,KRAMER, I'm not going if he's going.,39
32528,NEWMAN, Me either.,39
32529,GEORGE, I'm not going if he's going.,39
32530,MIKE, Well I'm going.,39
32531,JERRY, Well if he's going then I'm not going.,39
32532,NEWMAN, But it's your house.,39
32533,JERRY, I still don't have to go.,39
32534,ELAINE, Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.,39
32535,MIKE, Why won't you go if I go?,39
32536,JERRY, Why? I'll tell you why.,39
32537,KRAMER," No. Don't, Jerry.",39
32538,JERRY, Like you didn't call me a phony?,39
32539,MIKE," What?  Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang.",39
32540,JERRY, Use it in a sentence.,39
32541,MIKE," Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony.  Why'd you tell him?!?",39
32542,KRAMER, He begged me.,39
32543,MIKE, He begged you?!,39
32544,JERRY," Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?",39
32545,GEORGE," Officer, could I just explain something to you?",39
32546,GEORGE," Officer, he can't pull in head first.",39
32547,MIKE," Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was													sitting there.",39
32548,GEORGE," Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!",39
32549,MIKE," Well, you're gonna have to go to work!",39
32550,GEORGE, I don't have a job!,39
32551,MIKE, Neither do I!,39
32552,REFEREE, Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. *ding*,39
32553,JERRY," Kramer, what are you doing here!?",40
32554,KRAMER," Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"" and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.",40
32555,JERRY, You scared me!,40
32556,KRAMER, It's just me.,40
32557,JERRY, That's enough!,40
32558,KRAMER, Forgot the popper... ,40
32559,JERRY , C'mon...c'mon...,40
32560,JERRY, Kramer! What are you doing?!,40
32561,KRAMER, What does it look like I'm doing? What?,40
32562,JERRY," Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!",40
32563,KRAMER," Alright, alright...",40
32564,JERRY, C'mon!,40
32565,KRAMER, Sorry.,40
32566,JERRY, Move it! Move it! Get going!,40
32567,KRAMER, My drain's all clogged up! ,40
32568,JERRY , Is that my towel?,40
32569,GIRLFRIEND, I'm really happy the movie was sold out.,40
32570,JERRY," Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?",40
32571,GIRLFRIEND," I'm from Witchita, so...",40
32572,JERRY, Oh. I see. There he is! ,40
32573,GIRLFRIEND," Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry!",40
32574,JERRY, The murderers! ,40
32575,GIRLFRIEND, That was close!,40
32576,JERRY, Did you see the look on that guy's face?,40
32577,GIRLFRIEND, You were so fast with those keys. ,40
32578,JERRY, Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!,40
32579,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.",40
32580,JERRY," All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.",40
32581,KRAMER, What?,40
32582,JERRY," What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.",40
32583,KRAMER," Oh, come on!",40
32584,JERRY," No, come on!",40
32585,KRAMER," What, what, I thought you went to the movies!",40
32586,JERRY, It was sold out!,40
32587,KRAMER, Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?,40
32588,JERRY, That's the point.,40
32589,KRAMER, What point?,40
32590,JERRY," Just, look, just give the keys.",40
32591,KRAMER, Just give me another chance!,40
32592,JERRY, Don't ask me!,40
32593,KRAMER, I'm asking you!,40
32594,JERRY, I'm telling you.,40
32595,KRAMER, You're joking.,40
32596,JERRY, I'm serious!,40
32597,KRAMER, It's not going to happen again!,40
32598,JERRY," Yes it will, now give me those keys!",40
32599,KRAMER ," O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. ",40
32600,JERRY, So put 'em in a safe place.,40
32601,ELAINE, I will.,40
32602,JERRY, Where?,40
32603,ELAINE," I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?",40
32604,JERRY," I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.",40
32605,ELAINE," Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.",40
32606,JERRY, I can't.,40
32607,ELAINE , Is that Kramer? ,40
32608,JERRY, Who's there?,40
32609,KRAMER ," Uh, Kramer.  Oh, hi...uh...you got the...",40
32610,ELAINE," Oh, I'm not, uh...",40
32611,KRAMER," No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke ""the covenant of the keys.""",40
32612,ELAINE," Jerry, give him the keys back.",40
32613,JERRY, Elaine...,40
32614,KRAMER," I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float.  And I thank you.",40
32615,JERRY, Take the keys.,40
32616,KRAMER, I don't want the keys! ,40
32617,JERRY, O.K.!,40
32618,KRAMER," Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.",40
32619,JERRY, Your spare set?,40
32620,KRAMER, That's right.,40
32621,JERRY, You want 'em back?,40
32622,KRAMER," Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.",40
32623,GEORGE," Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.",40
32624,KRAMER," Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!",40
32625,GEORGE," Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.",40
32626,KRAMER," Well, you can get 'em back.",40
32627,GEORGE, I suppose I could.,40
32628,KRAMER," Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.",40
32629,GEORGE, Me?,40
32630,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.",40
32631,GEORGE," Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. ",40
32632,WAITRESS," Hi, are you ready to order? ",40
32633,KRAMER , Do you ever yearn?,40
32634,GEORGE, Yearn? Do I yearn?,40
32635,KRAMER, I yearn.,40
32636,GEORGE, You yearn.,40
32637,KRAMER," Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?",40
32638,GEORGE," Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.",40
32639,KRAMER , Look at you.,40
32640,GEORGE," Aw, Kramer, don't start...",40
32641,KRAMER , You're wasting your life.,40
32642,GEORGE," I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!",40
32643,KRAMER," O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?",40
32644,GEORGE, No.,40
32645,KRAMER, You got money?,40
32646,GEORGE, No.,40
32647,KRAMER, Do you have a woman?,40
32648,GEORGE, No.,40
32649,KRAMER, Do you have any prospects?,40
32650,GEORGE, No.,40
32651,KRAMER, You got anything on the horizon?,40
32652,GEORGE, Uh...no.,40
32653,KRAMER, Do you have any action at all?,40
32654,GEORGE, No.,40
32655,KRAMER, Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?,40
32656,GEORGE, I like to get the Daily News!,40
32657,KRAMER," George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.",40
32658,GEORGE, Why?,40
32659,KRAMER," I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.",40
32660,GEORGE," Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.",40
32661,KRAMER," No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.",40
32662,GEORGE," ""These pretzels are making me thirsty""? That was one line! You got fired!",40
32663,KRAMER," I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?",40
32664,GEORGE," Uh, no, I'm not.",40
32665,KRAMER," Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. ",40
32666,GEORGE," You're not really gonna go to California, are you?",40
32667,KRAMER ," Up here, I'm already gone. ",40
32668,GEORGE," Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.",40
32669,ELAINE, Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?,40
32670,GEORGE," I don't know. He said he wants to be my ""key brother.""",40
32671,ELAINE, That's ridiculous.,40
32672,GEORGE , That's Kramer.,40
32673,ELAINE, I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.,40
32674,GEORGE, What for?,40
32675,ELAINE, 'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.,40
32676,GEORGE, Jerry? Why?,40
32677,ELAINE, 'Cause he gave me his.,40
32678,GEORGE, So what?,40
32679,ELAINE," So, if he has my keys, I should have his.",40
32680,GEORGE," Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.",40
32681,ELAINE, I just said the same thing to you.,40
32682,GEORGE, What?,40
32683,ELAINE, What?,40
32684,GEORGE," Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?",40
32685,ELAINE," Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em.  What are you doing? Would you just put that down?  I gotta get some new friends.",40
32686,JERRY, Did you bring the keys?,40
32687,GEORGE," Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.",40
32688,JERRY, This could be an emergency!,40
32689,GEORGE, You never should have taken away his keys!,40
32690,JERRY," I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. ",40
32691,GEORGE, How'd the Mets do?,40
32692,JERRY, They lost.,40
32693,JERRY, Kramer?,40
32694,NEWMAN ," Hello, boys.",40
32695,JERRY," Hello, Newman.",40
32696,NEWMAN, You lookin' for someone?,40
32697,JERRY," Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!",40
32698,NEWMAN, Coy? I'm not being coy.,40
32699,JERRY , Is he being coy?,40
32700,GEORGE," Yeah, coy.",40
32701,JERRY," You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?",40
32702,NEWMAN , Who?,40
32703,JERRY," Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!",40
32704,NEWMAN," Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.",40
32705,JERRY," Turn around, George.",40
32706,GEORGE, Sure. ,40
32707,NEWMAN, George?,40
32708,JERRY," Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? ",40
32709,NEWMAN, Help! Help!,40
32710,JERRY, Where's Kramer?,40
32711,NEWMAN, HELP! ,40
32712,ELAINE, What's going on?,40
32713,NEWMAN, They're gonna beat me up!,40
32714,GEORGE, No we're not.,40
32715,JERRY, We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.,40
32716,NEWMAN," You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.",40
32717,JERRY, Bad rap?,40
32718,NEWMAN, Yeah. From you.,40
32719,JERRY, Me?,40
32720,NEWMAN, You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.,40
32721,JERRY, L.A.?,40
32722,JERRY," I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?",40
32723,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, I saw it.  I mean, it's complete bullshit.",40
32724,JERRY, Huh?,40
32725,ELAINE, What...?,40
32726,JERRY," No, what'd you say?",40
32727,ELAINE, Nothing. I didn't say anything.,40
32728,JERRY," Oh, you didn't see it.",40
32729,ELAINE," Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.",40
32730,JERRY," I heard you say something, there.",40
32731,ELAINE, I didn't say anything.,40
32732,JERRY," I'm calling Kramer's mother.   I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!",40
32733,GEORGE, Ask her about Kramer.,40
32734,JERRY, She's drunk out of her mind.,40
32735,JERRY ," Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.",40
32736,KRAMER , Hey! You ever been in an accident?,40
32737,BIKER," About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet!  Lean! ",40
32738,JERRY ," Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.",40
32739,GEORGE," Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.",40
32740,JERRY, Don't feel right? What are you talking about?,40
32741,GEORGE," Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?",40
32742,JERRY, What is the big deal?,40
32743,GEORGE," Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.",40
32744,JERRY," First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.",40
32745,GEORGE," Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.",40
32746,JERRY," Well, I want those keys. ",40
32747,GEORGE," Nope, no can do.",40
32748,JERRY," George, give them to me, I want these keys.  I don't want to get physical!",40
32749,GEORGE, Do you wanna fight?,40
32750,JERRY, Do you wanna fight?,40
32751,GEORGE, I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! ,40
32752,KRAMER," And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.",40
32753,KRAMER," Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.",40
32754,KRAMER," Oh, he's cold.",40

32756,KRAMER," Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.",40
32757,KRAMER," What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? ",40
32758,JERRY," Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.",40
32759,GEORGE," You're right, how did I miss that?  Maybe because it's a crock of shit.",40
32760,JERRY, What's that?,40
32761,GEORGE, Nothing.,40
32762,JERRY, I heard something.,40

32765,WOMAN, Goin' on four years.,40
32766,KRAMER," Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.",40
32767,WOMAN," Nothin'?  Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.",40
32768,KRAMER," You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.",40
32769,WOMAN, You want to give it a try?,40
32770,KRAMER, Really?,40
32771,WOMAN, Do you know how to double-clutch?,40
32772,KRAMER, Yeah.,40
32773,WOMAN," Well, come on! ",40
32774,GEORGE," They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!",40
32775,JERRY," Well, this is great.",40
32776,GEORGE," Well, what do they look like?",40
32777,JERRY," They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys.  ""What do they look like.""",40
32778,GEORGE," Well, they're obviously not here.",40
32779,JERRY," Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.",40
32780,GEORGE," Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!",40

32788,GEORGE, Gimme half!,40
32789,JERRY," All right, here!",40
32790,GEORGE, Why didn't she tell us?,40
32791,JERRY , Elaine is writing a sitcom...! ,40

32793,JERRY, What? What?,40
32794,ELAINE, How dare you!,40
32795,GEORGE, We hardly read anything!,40
32796,JERRY, It was funny!,40
32797,ELAINE, Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?,40
32798,JERRY, Well...  From what I saw...,40
32799,ELAINE ," Well, it's just a first draft!",40
32800,JERRY," I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.",40

32811,ELAINE," No, you can't be trusted!",40
32812,GEORGE," Alright, alright, fine. ",40
32813,JERRY , And I don't want you to hold mine!,40
32814,ELAINE, Good! I won't!,40
32815,JERRY, Good! Don't! Are these my keys?,40
32816,ELAINE, These aren't my keys!,40
32817,GEORGE, Whose are these?,40
32818,ELAINE, I don't know!,40
32819,ELAINE, I just thought I could write it.,40
32820,JERRY, Is that something you want to do?,40
32821,ELAINE, I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.,40
32822,JERRY," Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a ""Murphy Brown."" You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.",40
32823,ELAINE," O.K., can I just watch the show?  God, what an asshole.",40
32824,JERRY, What did you say?,40

32832,KRAMER," Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.",40
32833,CANDICE BERGEN," Snell. Well, hello, Mr. Snell.",40
32834,KRAMER, Steven.,40
32835,CANDICE BERGEN, Steven. Are you familiar with this computer system?,40
32836,KRAMER, Oh - I'm familiar with it.,40
32837,CANDICE BERGEN, Steven Snell? I know people...and I have a very good feeling about you. ,40
32838,GEORGE, Kramer was on Murphy Brown?,41

32847,JERRY, I know!,41

32849,JERRY, Sure.,41
32850,GEORGE, Did she show her breasts in that?,41
32851,JERRY, She's not really the naked type.,41
32852,GEORGE, I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.,41
32853,JERRY, He did?,41
32854,GEORGE," Yeah, I turned him down.",41
32855,JERRY, How come you didn't tell me?,41
32856,GEORGE, He asked me to keep it a secret.,41
32857,JERRY, But you can never keep a secret.,41
32858,GEORGE, I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.,41
32859,JERRY," Well, you've come a long way.",41
32860,GEORGE, I've matured.,41
32861,JERRY," Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?",41
32862,GEORGE, A free ticket?,41
32863,JERRY," Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.",41
32864,GEORGE, What about accommodations?,41
32865,JERRY, All taken care of.,41
32866,GEORGE," Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...",41
32867,KRAMER," So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.",41
32868,STUDIO GUARD," Hey, didn't I tell you to get out of here?",41
32869,KRAMER," Uh, did you?",41
32870,STUDIO GUARD," C'mon, let's go.",41
32871,KRAMER," Well, I was just--",41
32872,STUDIO GUARD," Yeah yeah, you were just nothing. C'mon, let's go.",41

32878,KRAMER," Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home.  Go ahead, it's all yours.",41
32879,HELENA, Hello Kramer.,41
32880,KRAMER," Oh, uh, Helena, how are you?",41
32881,HELENA," I haven't worked since 1934, how do you think I am?",41
32882,KRAMER," Well, that's only uh, 58 years.",41
32883,HELENA," It was a Three Stooges short, ""Sappy Pappy."" I played Mr. Sugarman's secretary, remember?",41
32884,KRAMER," Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?",41
32885,HELENA," No, a Curly. The boys played three sailors who find a baby, the baby's been kidnapped and the police think that they did it.",41
32886,KRAMER," Uh huh, right.",41
32887,HELENA," But, but of course they didn't do it, the police had made an awful mistake.",41
32888,KRAMER, Right.,41
32889,HELENA," Moe hits Curly with an axe,",41
32890,KRAMER, Uh huh.,41
32891,HELENA," The Stooges catch the kidnappers,",41
32892,KRAMER, Right.,41
32893,HELENA, But it's too late.,41
32894,KRAMER, Really.,41
32895,HELENA, The baby's dead.,41
32896,KRAMER, Really?,41
32897,HELENA, The boys are sent to Death Row and are executed.,41
32898,KRAMER, Well I don't remember that part.,41
32899,HELENA, I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary.,41
32900,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.",41
32901,HELENA," Yeah, it was sad for a Three Stooges, what with the dead baby and the Stooges being executed and all.",41
32902,KRAMER," Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.",41
32903,HELENA," Would you like to buy me a fat-free frozen yogurt at the store, Kramer?",41
32904,KRAMER," Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?",41
32905,HELENA," Well No! No, don't go out there, Kramer, they'll hurt you, they'll destroy you. You'll never make it in this town, you're too sensitive like me,",41
32906,KRAMER," Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.",41
32907,HELENA, I was engaged to Mickey Rooney! He left me at the altar. Kramer! Kramer!,41
32908,JERRY, What is this?,41
32909,GEORGE, What?,41
32910,JERRY," We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?",41
32911,GEORGE, I happen to dress based on mood.,41
32912,JERRY, Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.,41
32913,GEORGE," Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.",41
32914,JERRY, And what mood is this.,41
32915,GEORGE, This is Morning Mist.,41
32916,LT. COLEMAN," What do you figure, 20? 21?",41
32917,LT. MARTEL, Close enough.,41
32918,LT. COLEMAN, Forensics ought to be able to nail it down.,41
32919,LT. MARTEL, No ID?,41
32920,LT. COLEMAN, No ID.,41
32921,LT. MARTEL, No witnesses?,41
32922,LT. COLEMAN," Just the trees, Johnny. Pretty young thing.",41
32923,LT. MARTEL, She was. Not any more. Somebody saw to that.,41
32924,LT. COLEMAN," Sure did, Johnny. Damn shame too. What do you make of it?",41
32925,LT. MARTEL," I don't know, but I don't like it.",41
32926,JERRY," Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.",41
32927,GEORGE, Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.,41
32928,JERRY, Just go.,41
32929,GEORGE," Heh he, I made it.",41
32930,SECURITY GUARD, Empty your pockets please.,41
32931,SECURITY GUARD, Walk through again please.,41
32932,SECURITY GUARD, Are you sure you don't have any metal on you? Bracelets? Rings? Anklets?,41

32972,KRAMER, Really.,41
32973,CHELSEA," Yeah, they're trying to put together a miniseries for me on Eva Braun. I mean think about it, is that a great idea? We know nothing about Eva Braun, only that she was Hitler's girlfriend.",41
32974,KRAMER, Um-hm.,41
32975,CHELSEA, What was it like having sex with Adolf Hitler? What do you wear in a bunker? What did her parents think of Hitler as a potential son-in-law? I mean it could just go on and on...,41
32976,KRAMER," Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.",41
32977,CHELSEA, Big deal.,41
32978,KRAMER," He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.",41
32979,CHELSEA, Why are you breathing so hard?,41
32980,KRAMER," Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?",41
32981,KRAMER," Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...",41

32989,FRED ," Yeah, its fate, you know, can't avoid your fate.",41
32990,KRAMER, I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.,41

32998,GEORGE, What'd you ask me for?,41
32999,JERRY," Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?",41
33000,GEORGE, Nope.,41
33001,JERRY," 'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?",41
33002,GEORGE ," Hey, a shoe buffing machine!",41
33003,JERRY," I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?",41
33004,GEORGE," You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body													lotion!",41

33012,LUPE, Oh Yes.,41
33013,GEORGE, Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.,41
33014,LUPE," Oh, yes, yes.",41
33015,GEORGE," Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.",41
33016,LUPE," Yes, yes. It's too tight to sleep.",41
33017,GEORGE," Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?",41
33018,LUPE," Oh yees, It's too tight.  Him too?",41

33027,GEORGE," Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.",41
33028,LUPE, Okay.,41
33029,GEORGE," Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.",41
33030,JERRY," Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.",41
33031,GEORGE , Two no-tucks.,41
33032,JERRY," Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.",41
33033,GEORGE, You just said you weren't tucking.,41
33034,JERRY, I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.,41
33035,GEORGE," Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?",41
33036,JERRY," Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?",41
33037,LUPE," Oh, yes, yes. I throw away when we clean the room.",41
33038,JERRY," Oh, okay, thanks.",41
33039,LUPE, Thank you.,41
33040,GEORGE, Thank you.,41

33043,LUPE, Bye.,41
33044,GEORGE, Bye-bye.,41
33045,JERRY," I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.",41
33046,GEORGE," Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.",41
33047,JERRY, They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!,41
33048,GEORGE," Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.",41
33049,JERRY," Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.",41
33050,GEORGE," Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?",41
33051,GEORGE, You shouldn't have tucked.,41
33052,JERRY, I like it tucked.,41
33053,GEORGE, Nobody tucks anymore.,41
33054,OFFICER," Hey, Lieutenant.",41
33055,LT. MARTEL, Yeah.,41
33056,OFFICER, This was found on her person.,41
33057,LT. MARTEL, On her person? What kind of expression is that?,41
33058,OFFICER," I don't know, sir. Police lingo.",41
33059,LT. MARTEL," Oh yeah? What's your name, son.",41
33060,OFFICER, Ross.,41
33061,LT. MARTEL," Ross. Do you see that person there, Ross?",41
33062,OFFICER, Yes sir.,41
33063,LT. MARTEL, She's dead. Have you got that?,41
33064,OFFICER, Yes sir.,41
33065,LT. MARTEL, Good. Now get out of here before you find yourself on transit patrol writing tickets to senior citizens with fake bus passes.,41
33066,OFFICER, Yes sir.,41
33067,LT. MARTEL, I think we just caught a break.,41
33068,GEORGE," This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?",41
33069,JERRY, I don't know.,41
33070,GEORGE, Might meet a celebrity.,41
33071,JERRY, I can't believe she threw out my napkin.,41
33072,GEORGE," What are you worried about, you know it.",41
33073,JERRY, You gonna be alright here?,41
33074,GEORGE," Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.",41
33075,JERRY," Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.",41
33076,GEORGE," Go, go, go, don't worry about it.",41
33077,GEORGE, Hey.  Corbin Bernsen.,41
33078,CORBIN BERNSEN, How ya doing?,41
33079,GEORGE, Big fan! Big fan.,41
33080,CORBIN BERNSEN, Yeah.,41
33081,GEORGE," Hey, you grew a beard, huh?",41
33082,CORBIN BERNSEN," Yeah, yeah. I'm doing a movie during my hiatus.",41
33083,GEORGE," Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.",41
33084,CORBIN BERNSEN, Really.,41
33085,GEORGE," ...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.",41
33086,CORBIN BERNSEN, Yeah yeah yeah. So what happened?,41
33087,GEORGE," Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.",41
33088,CORBIN BERNSEN, So you killed the cat.,41
33089,GEORGE," That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?",41
33090,GEORGE, I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.,41
33091,GEORGE WENDT," Oh, of course not.",41
33092,GEORGE," But really, it's enough with the bar already.",41
33093,GEORGE WENDT," Yeah, well.",41
33094,GEORGE," Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?",41
33095,GEORGE WENDT," Doubt it, I doubt it. Yeah.",41
33096,GEORGE," Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?",41
33097,GEORGE WENDT," Well yeah, they do, heh heh.",41
33098,GEORGE, What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.,41
33099,GEORGE WENDT ," Yeah, you oughta write one of those.",41
33100,GEORGE, Yeah?,41
33101,GEORGE WENDT," Yeah, I'll bring it up with the producers, I gotta... uh...",41
33102,GEORGE," Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!",41
33103,JERRY, How's it going?,41
33104,GEORGE, Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.,41
33105,JERRY, Really?,41
33106,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!",41
33107,JERRY, You got toilet paper on your heel there.,41
33108,CORBIN BERNSEN," Oh yeah, yeah, people are always coming up to me trying to give me a great case for L.A. Law, just a few seconds ago, right here, right outside in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says he's supposed to watch this girl's cat while she's away out of town. Anyway he forgets to feed the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses to get her a new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants Arnie Becker to represent him. Nice guy. Yeah, that'd make a *great* case for L.A. Law. Thanks a lot.",41
33109,HELENA," He's a very handsome man. Passionate, intense, but troubled, strange. I think he may be in love with me. Of course there's nothing abnormal about that, I have many suitors.",41
33110,GEORGE WENDT," It's funny, 'cause even after all these years, we still get people giving us advice, how to improve the show. Actually, a few moments ago I ran into a nut back there, he said, you know, that maybe we should think about, you know, not doing the show in a bar.",41
33111,THE FREAK," So that's when I said, ""Hey, Kramer, dude. You ever killed a man before?"" And he said, ""What do you think, Junior? These hands have been soaking in Ivory liquid?",41
33112,GEORGE WENDT," The guy you talked to, what did he look like?",41
33113,CORBIN BERNSEN, Short little bald guy with glasses.,41
33114,GEORGE WENDT," Yeah, yeah, that's the same guy I talked to.",41
33115,CORBIN BERNSEN," It never ends, does it?",41
33116,JERRY," So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.",41
33117,LT. MARTEL," Issue an arrest warrant, put out an APB. Let's pick up this, uh, Kramer.",41
33118,JERRY, I was terrible.,41
33119,GEORGE," What are you, crazy? You were fine.",41
33120,JERRY," Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...",41
33121,GEORGE, Conveyor belt.,41
33122,JERRY, Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin.,41
33123,GEORGE," I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?",41
33124,JERRY," Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.",41
33125,TV NEWSCASTER," Our top story tonight, there has been a break in the so called 'Smog Stranglings'. Police have just released a photo of the suspect being sought in connection with the slayings. He is known only as ""Kramer"".",41
33126,GEORGE," He's on the lamb, he's on the loose!",42
33127,JERRY," Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!",42
33128,GEORGE," What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?",42
33129,JERRY, Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.,42
33130,GEORGE, Hope he's not the guy.,42
33131,JERRY, Couldn't be the guy...nah.,42
33132,GEORGE," God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger.",42
33133,JERRY, How can you think of food at the time like this?,42
33134,GEORGE, Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.,42
33135,JERRY," I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!",42
33136,GEORGE," I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.",42
33137,JERRY, You should've had some eggs.,42
33138,GEORGE, For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?,42
33139,JERRY, Have you ever heard of egg salad?,42
33140,GEORGE, Why didn't you say something then?,42
33141,JERRY, I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?,42
33142,GEORGE," I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.",42
33143,JERRY," I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.",42
33144,GEORGE," Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.",42
33145,JERRY, I don't have any change. You've got any change?,42
33146,GEORGE," No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.",42
33147,JERRY," Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.",42
33148,GEORGE, I have a ten.,42
33149,JERRY," So, break it.",42
33150,GEORGE, I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.,42
33151,JERRY," So, buy something.",42
33152,GEORGE, What?,42
33153,JERRY," I don't know, some mints or TicTacs.",42
33154,GEORGE, Breath problem?,42
33155,JERRY," No, I just want some change.",42
33156,GEORGE, Tell me.,42
33157,JERRY," Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.",42
33158,GEORGE," You know, I haven't eaten anything.",42
33159,JERRY, I just wanna call the police!,42
33160,GEORGE, Why don't you just call 911?,42
33161,JERRY, But is this an emergency?,42
33162,GEORGE, Of course it is.,42
33163,JERRY, How is this an emergency?,42
33164,GEORGE, Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.,42
33165,JERRY," All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...",42
33166,GEORGE, What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!,42
33167,JERRY," Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?",42
33168,GEORGE," What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?",42
33169,JERRY," Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.",42
33170,GEORGE, Really?,42
33171,JERRY, Sure.,42
33172,GEORGE, You think so?,42
33173,JERRY," Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler.  would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?",42
33174,GEORGE, I don't know.,42
33175,JERRY," We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.",42
33176,GEORGE," Excuse me, where are we?",42
33177,MAN, Earth.,42
33178,JERRY," Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.",42
33179,GEORGE, Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?,42
33180,WOMAN, I don't know.,42
33181,GEORGE, You don't know?,42
33182,WOMAN, I don't know.,42
33183,GEORGE, How come you don't know what street are you on?,42
33184,WOMAN, You don't know.,42
33185,JERRY," George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is?  No...do we know where 170 is?  No...do we know where 134 is?  No. Aha, ok.  He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.",42
33186,GEORGE, Black and white?,42
33187,JERRY, A cop car.,42
33188,GEORGE, Why didn't you just say that?,42
33189,JERRY, I thought it sounded kind of cool.,42
33190,GEORGE," Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.",42
33191,JERRY," Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.",42
33192,GEORGE," I'll bet you, how much?",42
33193,JERRY, Her tip.,42
33194,GEORGE, You've got a bet.,42
33195,JERRY, Ok.,42
33196,GEORGE, How much do you tip a chamber maid?,42
33197,POLICE, Which one of you is Costanza?,42
33198,POLICE, Get in.,42
33199,GEORGE," Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or...",42
33200,GEORGE," Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.",42
33201,JERRY," Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.",42
33202,COP, Cut it up back there.,42
33203,GEORGE, He started it.,42
33204,JERRY, I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?,42
33205,COP, I don't think so.,42
33206,JERRY, But you could?,42
33207,COP," Oh yeah, of course we could. We can do anything we want.",42
33208,COP," Yeah, we do that all the time. You should see the looks on people's faces.",42
33209,GEORGE, You guys ever shot anybody?,42
33210,COPS, No...,42
33211,GEORGE," Hey, can I flip on the siren?",42

33213,GEORGE," I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.",42
33214,COP," Yeah, go ahead.",42
33215,GEORGE," Wohoo, check it out.",42

33217,COP," Yeah, go ahead, hurry up.",42
33218,JERRY, Scared the hell out of that guy.,42
33219,GEORGE," You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always ""waaaa, waaaa"", you know now it ""woo-woo-woo-woo-woo"". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?",42
33220,JERRY," Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...",42
33221,COP, Hey!,42
33222,KRAMER, I'm dizzy.,42

33227,JERRY," What is that, a 12 gauge?",42
33228,COP, Yeah.,42

33230,GEORGE, My favorite.,42
33231,JERRY," Mine too, love the 12 gauge.",42
33232,GEORGE, Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.,42
33233,COP, What do got over there?,42
33234,COP, Looks like a possible 5-19.,42
33235,JERRY, 5-19? What's a 5-19?,42

33249,JERRY, Which flavor?,42
33250,GEORGE, Milano.,42
33251,JERRY, Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?,42
33252,GEORGE, Should I take some?,42
33253,JERRY, I think that's a 5-19.,42
33254,GEORGE, I'm starving...,42
33255,JERRY, They're busting this guy.,42
33256,GEORGE, They're cuffing him.,42
33257,JERRY, I can't believe this.,42

33270,JERRY," No, a dollar, two tops.",42
33271,GUY," Hey, you guys aren't cuffed. What are you, narks?",42
33272,GEORGE, Narks?,42
33273,JERRY," Imagine, us narks?",42
33274,GEORGE," No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer.",42
33275,GUY," Really? Well, that's very nice.",42
33276,GEORGE," Oh, thank you.",42
33277,JERRY," Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.",42
33278,GEORGE," Yeah well, we don't think.",42
33279,JERRY, We're pretty sure.,42
33280,GUY, A dollar a night?,42
33281,JERRY," Yeah, that's a good tip!",42
33282,GUY, That stinks!,42

33289,GEORGE, I don't know why I'm doing this.,42
33290,KRAMER," Jerry, George!",42
33291,LT. MARTEL, You are under arrest in first degree murder and death of Ms Chelsea Lang.,42
33292,REPORTERS, Why did you do it? What possessed you?,42
33293,KRAMER, I don't know...,42
33294,KRAMER," Hey, how are you doing? Jerry! George!",42
33295,JERRY, We're doing fine. How are you?,42
33296,KRAMER," What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player.",42
33297,GEORGE, A player?,42
33298,KRAMER," Yeah, a player...",42
33299,JERRY," Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?",42
33300,KRAMER," What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together.",42
33301,JERRY," Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!",42
33302,KRAMER," So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?",42
33303,JERRY," Well, yeah...sure.",42
33304,POLICE," Kramer, let's go. The Lieutenant wants to see you.",42
33305,KRAMER," Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?",42
33306,KRAMER, Help me!! Help me!,42
33307,KRAMER," I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!",42
33308,LT. MARTEL," Don't you ever swear to my God, Kramer. My God is the god who protects the innocent and punishes the evil scum like you, have you got that?",42
33309,KRAMER, You're making a big mistake.,42
33310,LT. MARTEL," No! You have made the mistake, Kramer. Sickies like you always do. The only difference is that this time you're gonna pay.",42
33311,KRAMER, What?,42
33312,LT. MARTEL," Now you might beat the gas chamber Kramer, but as long as I have got a breath in my body you will never ever see the light of day again.",42
33313,KRAMER," Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!",42
33314,LT. MARTEL," Oh yeah, right. Maybe it was one of your other personalities huh, the wise guy, the little kid, the bellhop, the ball player, maybe the door to door vacuum cleaner salesman, but not you right? No, you wouldn't hurt a fly. You just couldn't help yourself, could you Kramer? You saw life brimming brightly with optimism and verve and you just had to snuff it out.",42
33315,KRAMER," Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...",42
33316,LT. MARTEL," I'm not interested in your explanations, Kramer! Sure, I bet you've got a million of 'em. Maybe your mother didn't love you enough, maybe the teacher didn't call on you in school when you had your little hand raised, maybe the pervert in the park had a present in his pants, huh? Well, I've got another theory you're a weed.",42
33317,KRAMER, No...,42
33318,LT. MARTEL, Society is filled with them. They're choking the life out of the all pretty flowers.,42
33319,LT. MARTEL," You see something even remotely pretty and you have to choke the life out if it, don't you Kramer?",42
33320,LT. MARTEL," You killed all the pretty flowers, didn't you Kramer? You killed the pretty little flowers, didn't you? You dirty, filthy, stinky weed! Didn't you?",42
33321,OFFICER," Lieutenant, it's for you.",42
33322,LT. MARTEL, Martel...yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah.,42
33323,OFFICER," What it is, Lieutenant?",42
33324,LT. MARTEL, Let him go.,42
33325,OFFICER," What, but Lieutenant?",42
33326,LT. MARTEL," You heard me, let him go. They just found another body at the Laurel Canyon. Go on Kramer, get out of my sight.",42
33327,KRAMER," Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?",42
33328,LT. MARTEL, I said beat it!,42
33329,KRAMER, Hahaa!,42
33330,GEORGE, What?,42
33331,JERRY, What happened?,42
33332,KRAMER, Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.,42
33333,JERRY, Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!,42
33334,GEORGE, You're kidding? Somebody else got killed?,42
33335,JERRY, While you were in jail. So you're free.,42
33336,KRAMER," Yes, I'm free.  'cause the murderer struck again!",42
33337,JERRY," So Kramer, what are you going to do?",42
33338,KRAMER," Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.",42
33339,GEORGE," Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?",42
33340,KRAMER," What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?",42
33341,GEORGE, I'd like to hear that.,42
33342,JERRY, Yeah...,42
33343,KRAMER," Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...",42
33344,JERRY," Kramer, she was murdered!",42
33345,KRAMER," Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.",42
33346,GEORGE, As a suspect in a serial killing.,42
33347,KRAMER," Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.",42
33348,GEORGE," What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.",42
33349,JERRY, So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?,42
33350,KRAMER," No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.",42
33351,GEORGE," Taste this, is this a dill?",42
33352,JERRY," No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.",42
33353,KRAMER," Ok, it's forgotten.",42
33354,GEORGE," Tarragon? Oh, you're crazy.",42
33355,JERRY," Well, take it easy.",42
33356,KRAMER," Yeah, ok.",42
33357,GEORGE," Yeah, take care. Stay in touch.",42
33358,KRAMER," Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...",42
33359,JERRY," Oh, no...",42
33360,GEORGE," No, you're crushing my sandwich.",42
33361,JERRY," Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.",42
33362,GEORGE, Mint?,42
33363,JERRY, No thanks.,42
33364,GEORGE," I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.",42
33365,JERRY," It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.",42
33366,GEORGE, Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?,42
33367,JERRY," No, I don't.",42
33368,GEORGE," You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.",42
33369,JERRY," Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.",42
33370,GEORGE," I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.",42
33371,JERRY, How much did you wound up tipping her?,42
33372,GEORGE," Oh my God, I forgot!",42
33373,JERRY," Well, communism didn't work.",42
33374,KRAMER, Hey!,42
33375,KRAMER, Any mustard? This is empty.,42
33376,JERRY," Yeah, there's a new one in there.",42
33377,KRAMER," No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?",42
33378,JERRY, Help yourself.,42
33379,KRAMER," Yeah, all right.",42
33380,GEORGE," Kramer, what are you doing here?",42
33381,KRAMER, Getting something to eat.,42
33382,JERRY," Kramer, here!",42
33383,GEORGE, What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?,43
33384,JERRY, What?,43
33385,GEORGE, I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?,43
33386,JERRY, Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.,43
33387,GEORGE, What?,43
33388,JERRY, That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?,43
33389,GEORGE," All right, so what did they do?",43
33390,JERRY, I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.,43
33391,GEORGE, Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.,43
33392,JERRY," Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .",43
33393,STU," Excuse me, Jerry? I'm Stu Chermak. I'm with NBC.",43
33394,JERRY, Hi.,43
33395,STU, Could we speak for a few moments?,43
33396,JERRY, Sure.,43
33397,JAY," Hi, Jay Crespi.",43
33398,JERRY, Hello.,43
33399,GEORGE," Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I?",43
33400,JAY, That's right.,43
33401,GEORGE, I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.,43
33402,JAY," Mm, I'm not-",43
33403,JERRY, George-,43
33404,GEORGE,"  Huh? All right, fine.",43
33405,STU," First of all, that was a terrific show.",43
33406,JERRY, Oh thank you very much.,43
33407,STU," And basically, I just wanted to let you know that we've been discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested in doing something.",43
33408,JERRY, Really? Wow.,43
33409,STU," So, if you have any idea for like a TV show for yourself, well, we'd just love to talk about it.",43
33410,JERRY, I'd be very interested in something like that.,43
33411,STU," Well, here, uh, why don't you give us a call and maybe we can develop a series.",43
33412,JERRY, Okay. Great. Thanks.,43
33413,STU, It was very nice meeting you.,43
33414,JERRY, Thank you.,43
33415,JAY, Nice meeting you.,43
33416,JERRY, Nice meeting you.,43
33417,GEORGE, What was that all about?,43
33418,JERRY, They said they were interested in me.,43
33419,GEORGE, For what?,43
33420,JERRY," You know, a TV show.",43
33421,GEORGE, Your own show?,43
33422,JERRY," Yeah, I guess so.",43
33423,GEORGE, They want you to do a TV show?,43
33424,JERRY," Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.",43
33425,GEORGE," Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.",43
33426,JERRY, Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?,43
33427,GEORGE, Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.,43
33428,JERRY, But gymnastics is not for everybody.,43
33429,GEORGE," I know, but he's your son.",43
33430,JERRY, So what?,43
33431,GEORGE," All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.",43
33432,JERRY, Yeah and...?,43
33433,GEORGE, And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.,43
33434,JERRY, What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?,43
33435,GEORGE, Why not?,43
33436,JERRY, So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.,43
33437,GEORGE," I know, but antiques are very popular right now.",43
33438,JERRY," No they're not, they used to be.",43
33439,GEORGE," Oh yeah, like you know.",43
33440,JERRY, Oh like you do.,43
33441,KRAMER, ...And you're the manager of the circus.,43
33442,JERRY, A circus?,43
33443,KRAMER," Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.",43
33444,JERRY, I don't think so.,43
33445,KRAMER," Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.",43
33446,JERRY, I don't think the network will go for it.,43
33447,KRAMER, Why not?,43
33448,JERRY," Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.",43
33449,KRAMER," Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a ""can't miss.""",43
33450,NEWMAN,Kramer.,43
33451,JERRY, Hello Newman.,43
33452,NEWMAN, Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.,43
33453,KRAMER, All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? ,43
33454,JERRY," Yeah, sure.",43
33455,NEWMAN," Yeah, sure.",43
33456,JERRY, What's this all about?,43
33457,NEWMAN, We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.,43
33458,JERRY, I didn't know you had a motorctcle.,43
33459,NEWMAN, Well my girlfriend had one.,43
33460,JERRY, You have a girlfriend?,43
33461,NEWMAN, I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.,43
33462,JERRY, I never remember you with a girl.,43
33463,NEWMAN," Nevertheless, ...",43
33464,JERRY, This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.,43
33465,NEWMAN, Don't say anything.,43
33466,JERRY, All right.,43
33467,JERRY, You know you're getting gypped over here.,43
33468,KRAMER," Really, Ah,",43
33469,NEWMAN, We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.,43
33470,KRAMER," Oh, stop saying 'reneging"".",43
33471,NEWMAN, Well you're reneging.,43
33472,KRAMER," I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.",43
33473,NEWMAN, All right give it to me. let go ...,43
33474,KRAMER, You let go - come on ...,43
33475,JERRY, Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!,43
33476,NEWMAN, Thanks buddy. So long he he ...,43
33477,JERRY, Does that thing work?,43
33478,KRAMER, Nah.,43
33479,JERRY, ... I just got a postcard from Elaine?,43
33480,GEORGE, Really?,43
33481,JERRY," Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.",43
33482,GEORGE, I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.,43
33483,GEORGE," So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?",43
33484,JERRY," No, nothing.",43
33485,GEORGE, Why don't they have salsa on the table?,43
33486,JERRY, What do you need salsa for?,43
33487,GEORGE, Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.,43
33488,JERRY," You know why? Because people like to say ""salsa."" ""Excuse me, do you have salsa?"" ""We need more salsa."" ""Where is the salsa? No salsa?""",43
33489,GEORGE," You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa.  ""I wanted seltzer, not salsa.""",43
33490,JERRY," ""Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!""",43
33491,GEORGE," See, this should be a show. This is the show.",43
33492,JERRY, What?,43
33493,GEORGE, This. Just talking.,43
33494,JERRY,"  Yeah, right.",43
33495,GEORGE, I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.,43
33496,JERRY, Just talking? Well what's the show about?,43
33497,GEORGE, It's about nothing.,43
33498,JERRY, No story?,43
33499,GEORGE, No forget the story.,43
33500,JERRY, You've got to have a story.,43
33501,GEORGE," Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.",43
33502,JERRY, And who is on the show? Who are the characters?,43
33503,GEORGE, I could be a character.,43
33504,JERRY, You?,43
33505,GEORGE, Yeah. You could base a character on me.,43
33506,JERRY," So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?",43
33507,GEORGE," Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, ""You know you're a quite a character.""",43
33508,JERRY, And who else is on the show?,43
33509,GEORGE, Elaine could be a character. Kramer..,43
33510,JERRY, Now he's a character.  So everybody I know is a character on the show.,43
33511,GEORGE, Right.,43
33512,JERRY, And it's about nothing?,43
33513,GEORGE, Absolutely nothing.,43
33514,JERRY," So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.",43
33515,GEORGE, We go into NBC.,43
33516,JERRY," ""We""? Since when are you a writer?",43
33517,GEORGE,  Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.,43
33518,JERRY, You want to go with me to NBC?,43
33519,GEORGE, Yeah. I think we really go something here.,43
33520,JERRY, What do we got?,43
33521,GEORGE, An idea.,43
33522,JERRY, What idea?,43
33523,GEORGE, An idea for the show.,43
33524,JERRY, I still don't know what the idea is.,43
33525,GEORGE, It's about nothing.,43
33526,JERRY, Right.,43
33527,GEORGE," Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.",43
33528,JERRY," So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.",43
33529,GEORGE, Exactly.,43
33530,JERRY," They say, ""What's your show about?"" I say, ""Nothing.""",43
33531,GEORGE, There you go.,43
33532,JERRY,  I think you may have something there.,43
33533,JERRY," So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.",43
33534,KRAMER,"  No, I don't think so.",43
33535,JERRY, What do you mean you don't think so?,43
33536,KRAMER, I don't like it.,43
33537,JERRY, I don't understand. What don't you like about it?,43
33538,KRAMER, I don't like the idea of a character based on me.,43
33539,JERRY, Why not?,43
33540,KRAMER, well it just doesn't sit well.,43
33541,JERRY, You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.,43
33542,KRAMER," That's your problem, buddy.",43
33543,JERRY, I don't understand what the big deal is.,43
33544,KRAMER," Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.",43
33545,JERRY, Whatever you want.,43
33546,KRAMER, I get to play Kramer.,43
33547,JERRY, You can't play Kramer.,43
33548,KRAMER, I am Kramer.,43
33549,JERRY, But you can't act.,43
33550,KRAMER, Phew!,43
33551,JERRY," Okay, fine. We'll use Newman.",43
33552,KRAMER, Newman?,43
33553,NEWMAN,Use me for what?,43
33554,JERRY, Nothin' What do you want?,43
33555,NEWMAN,"Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving  home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?",43
33556,KRAMER, Yeah. That's strange.,43
33557,NEWMAN,"A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.",43
33558,KRAMER, That's queer uh?,43
33559,NEWMAN, I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.,43
33560,KRAMER," Yeah, you better think again Mojumbo.",43
33561,NEWMAN,You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?,43
33562,JERRY, Buyer beware.,43
33563,NEWMAN,Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?,43
33564,KRAMER, No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.,43
33565,NEWMAN,"No, but there's karma, Kramer.",43
33566,JERRY, Karma Kramer?,43
33567,NEWMAN,And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. ,43
33568,JERRY,"  Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa.  What's the matter?",43
33569,GEORGE,  Nothing.,43
33570,JERRY, You sure? You look a little pale.,43
33571,GEORGE," No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.",43
33572,JERRY," What, are you nervous?",43
33573,GEORGE," No, not nervous. I'm good, very good.  I can't do this! Can't do this!",43
33574,JERRY, What?,43
33575,GEORGE, I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.,43
33576,JERRY, This was your idea!,43
33577,GEORGE, What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.,43
33578,JERRY, Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.,43
33579,GEORGE," They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.",43
33580,JERRY, I told you not to come.,43
33581,GEORGE, I need some water. I gotta get some water.,43
33582,JERRY, They'll give us water in there.,43
33583,GEORGE, Really? That's pretty good.,43
33584,JERRY," Oh God, it's Joe Devola.",43
33585,GEORGE, Who?,43
33586,JERRY," This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.",43
33587,JERRY, Oh God he saw me.,43
33588,DEVOLA, Hello Jerry.,43
33589,JERRY, Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING?,43
33590,DEVOLA, You're under no obligation to shake my hand.,43
33591,JERRY," Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.",43
33592,DEVOLA, Why shouldn't I look good?,43
33593,JERRY," Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?",43
33594,DEVOLA, You want to hit me?,43
33595,JERRY, What are you doing here?,43
33596,DEVOLA, I dreopped a script off.,43
33597,JERRY," AH, GOOD FOR YOU.",43
33598,JERRY," Well, ...",43
33599,DEVOLA, You don't have to say anything.,43
33600,JERRY," No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.",43
33601,DEVOLA, Why?,43
33602,JERRY, Kramer's party.,43
33603,DEVOLA, Kramer's ... having ... a ... party?,43
33604,JERRY," No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.",43
33605,DEVOLA," Gee, I thought Kramer and I were very close friends.",43
33606,JERRY," No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.",43
33607,JERRY, Give my best to Hinckley.,43
33608,GEORGE, What was that?,43
33609,JERRY," I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...",43
33610,RECEPTIONIST, They're ready for you.,43
33611,GEORGE," Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?",43
33612,JERRY, Relax. Who are they?,43
33613,GEORGE," Yeah, they're not better than me.",43
33614,JERRY, Course not.,43
33615,GEORGE, Who are they?,43
33616,JERRY, They're nobody.,43
33617,GEORGE, What about me?,43
33618,JERRY, What about you?,43
33619,GEORGE, Why them? Why not me?,43
33620,JERRY, Why not you?,43
33621,GEORGE, I'm as good as them.,43
33622,JERRY, Better.,43
33623,GEORGE, You really think so?,43
33624,JERRY, No.,43
33625,STU,"  The bit, the bit I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now that's funny.",43
33626,GEORGE," The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.",43
33627,JERRY," Yeah, it's one of my favorites.",43
33628,RUSSELL," What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know?",43
33629,GEORGE,"  Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, ""La Cocina."" ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.",43
33630,JERRY," Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?",43
33631,GEORGE, Pepe.,43
33632,JERRY," Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.",43
33633,SUSAN," Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?",43
33634,GEORGE," No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.",43
33635,RUSSELL," So, what have you two come up with?",43
33636,JERRY," Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-",43
33637,GEORGE,  May I?,43
33638,JERRY, Go ahead.,43
33639,GEORGE, I think I can sum up the show for you with one word,43
33640,RUSSELL, Nothing?,43
33641,GEORGE,  Nothing.,43
33642,RUSSELL,  What does that mean?,43
33643,GEORGE, The show is about nothing.,43
33644,JERRY,"  Well, it's not about nothing.",43
33645,GEORGE,"  No, it's about nothing.",43
33646,JERRY," Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.",43
33647,RECEPTIONIST," Mr. Dalrymple, your niece is on the phone.",43
33648,RUSSELL, I'll call back.,43
33649,GEORGE, D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?,43
33650,RUSSELL,  Not even close.,43
33651,GEORGE," Is it with a ""y""?",43
33652,RUSSELL, No.,43
33653,SUSAN, What's the premise?,43
33654,JERRY," ..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.",43
33655,GEORGE," Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.",43
33656,RUSSELL, You read? You read on the show?,43
33657,JERRY," Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.",43
33658,RUSSELL," All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?",43
33659,GEORGE," Oh, no. No stories.",43
33660,RUSSELL," No stories? So, what is it?",43
33661,GEORGE,  What'd you do today?,43
33662,RUSSELL, I got up and came to work.,43
33663,GEORGE, There's a show. That's a show.,43
33664,RUSSELL,  How is that a show?,43
33665,JERRY," Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.",43
33666,GEORGE," No, no, no. Nothing happens.",43
33667,JERRY," Well, something happens.",43
33668,RUSSELL," Well, why am I watching it?",43
33669,GEORGE, Because it's on TV.,43
33670,RUSSELL,  Not yet.,43
33671,GEORGE," Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it.  Right?",43
33672,JERRY,  How about this,43
33673,JERRY," I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.",43
33674,GEORGE, . . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.,43
33675,JERRY, Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?,43
33676,GEORGE," Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.",43
33677,JERRY, IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!,43
33678,GEORGE," Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.",43
33679,JERRY," Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.",43
33680,GEORGE, Wait a minute let me call Susan.,43
33681,JERRY," No, no this is more important.",43
33682,GEORGE, She might be leaving to work any minute.,43
33683,JERRY," No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.",43
33684,GEORGE, No.,43
33685,ELAINE, What is it?,43
33686,DR. RESTON, I was just thinking about this patient of mine.,43
33687,ELAINE, What?,43
33688,DR. RESTON, Just wondering if he's taking his medication.,43
33689,ELAINE," Well, come on we're on vacation.",43
33690,JERRY," Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... ",43
33691,KRAMER, Yeah ,43
33692,GEORGE,  It's George.,43
33693,JERRY," And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.",43
33694,KRAMER," Whoa, back up a second.",43
33695,JERRY," Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.",43
33696,KRAMER, Why would you think I would invite him?,43
33697,JERRY," I just a ssumed, ...",43
33698,KRAMER, Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.,43
33699,GEORGE," Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.",43
33700,JERRY, Of course. How are you?,43
33701,SUSAN," Fine, it's good to see you.",43
33702,GEORGE, And this is Kramer.,43
33703,SUSAN, Hello.,43
33704,GEORGE," All right go ahead Susan, tell him.",43
33705,JERRY, Tell me what?,43
33706,SUSAN," Well, I, ",43
33707,JERRY," Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.",43
33708,TEL," Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance service.",43
33709,JERRY," Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.",43
33710,TEL," Uh, I'm sorry we're not allowed to do that.",43
33711,JERRY," Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.",43
33712,TEL, No.,43
33713,JERRY, Well now you know how I feel. ,43
33714,GEORGE," Well, go ahead, tell him.",43
33715,JERRY," Kramer, are you drinking that milk?",43
33716,KRAMER, Yeah.,43
33717,JERRY, What's the expiration date on that?,43
33718,KRAMER, September third.,43
33719,JERRY, The third?,43
33720,GEORGE, and SUSAN,43
33721,KRAMER," Um, Uh, ugh, ...",43
33722,SUSAN, Noooo... ,43
33723,GEORGE, I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.,43
33724,JERRY, I think SHE saw it coming.,43
33725,GEORGE, You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.,43
33726,JERRY, Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.,43
33727,GEORGE," What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.",43
33728,JERRY," Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.",43
33729,GEORGE," Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.",43
33730,JERRY, What happened to you?,43
33731,KRAMER, Devola came after me.,43
33732,JERRY, What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?,43
33733,KRAMER," Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, ""That's what I thin k of your party.""",43
33734,JERRY," Boy, that is some kick.",43
33735,KRAMER," Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.",43
33736,JERRY," Wow, Newman's helmet.",43
33737,GEORGE, Holly.,43
33738,KRAMER, I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.,43
33739,JERRY," Me, why?",43
33740,KRAMER, He doesn't like you.,43
33741,JERRY, What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.,43
33742,KRAMER, Pass the cream.,43
33743,GEORGE, Wait a second. . all right.,43
33744,JERRY,  Where the hell did I put this?,44
33745,KRAMER, What are you looking for?,44
33746,JERRY," The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?",44
33747,KRAMER," No, no, no.",44
33748,JERRY," All right, what is this?",44
33749,KRAMER,  what is what?,44
33750,JERRY," All right, very funny. I get it.",44
33751,KRAMER, You're in a weird mood.,44
33752,JERRY, Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.,44
33753,KRAMER, Fix what?,44
33754,JERRY, Your pants!,44
33755,KRAMER, what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?,44
33756,JERRY, Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?,44
33757,KRAMER," No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?",44
33758,JERRY, Go look at your face in the mirror.,44
33759,KRAMER, Wha-huh-wha-huh...,44
33760,JERRY,  yeah?,44
33761,GEORGE,  It's George.,44
33762,JERRY, Come on up.,44
33763,KRAMER, I don't believe this.,44
33764,JERRY," You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?",44
33765,KRAMER," No, I swear.",44
33766,JERRY, I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.,44
33767,GEORGE,  Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.,44
33768,KRAMER, Me?,44
33769,GEORGE," Yeah, here you go.",44
33770,KRAMER, What's this?,44
33771,GEORGE, A dry-cleaning bill?,44
33772,JERRY, From that woman at NBC?,44
33773,GEORGE, Yeah.,44
33774,KRAMER, A dry-cleaning bill for what?,44
33775,GEORGE, For vomiting on her vest!,44
33776,KRAMER," Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!",44
33777,GEORGE," Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!",44
33778,KRAMER," Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.",44
33779,GEORGE,"  Yeah, your milk.",44
33780,JERRY,  He drank it.,44
33781,KRAMER, I didn't know.,44
33782,JERRY," All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.",44
33783,KRAMER, Yeah.,44
33784,JERRY, How much was it to clean the vest?,44
33785,GEORGE, Eighteen dollars.,44
33786,JERRY, Can you get vomit out of suede?,44
33787,GEORGE, I don't know.,44
33788,KRAMER, Yo-yo Ma!,44
33789,JERRY, What? Yo-yo Ma?,44
33790,KRAMER, What about him?,44
33791,JERRY, You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.,44
33792,GEORGE, What's Yo-yo Ma?,44
33793,JERRY, He's a cellist.  You should see a doctor today.,44
33794,GEORGE," All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.",44
33795,JERRY, I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.,44
33796,GEORGE, I know!,44
33797,JERRY," That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?",44
33798,GEORGE, The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network,44
33799,JERRY," Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!",44
33800,GEORGE," It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.",44
33801,KRAMER, Jeez!,44
33802,GEORGE, Anyway.,44
33803,JERRY,"  What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today.  Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.",44
33804,GEORGE, What?,44
33805,JERRY, NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.,44
33806,GEORGE," They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?",44
33807,JERRY, I don't know about sixty.,44
33808,GEORGE," Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?",44
33809,JERRY," Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?",44
33810,GEORGE, I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.',44
33811,JERRY," Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!",44
33812,GEORGE, Oh!,44
33813,JERRY," You know, I think he wears a piece.",44
33814,GEORGE," Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.",44
33815,JERRY, I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.,44
33816,GEORGE," What, is that the one your parents gave you?",44
33817,JERRY, Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.,44
33818,GEORGE," All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.",44
33819,JERRY, I'll pay for it.,44
33820,GEORGE, It's not the money!,44
33821,JERRY," Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?",44
33822,LEO, Jerry!,44
33823,JERRY, Uncle Leo!,44
33824,LEO, Helloooo!,44
33825,JERRY," Hello there, how're you doing?",44
33826,LEO, Ha ha! How are you?,44
33827,JERRY," Good, good.",44
33828,LEO, How's your mom and dad?,44
33829,JERRY," Good, fine.",44
33830,LEO, What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!,44
33831,JERRY," Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.",44
33832,LEO, You know where I just came from?,44
33833,JERRY,"  Oh, sure. Danny.",44
33834,LEO, He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!,44
33835,JERRY," Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.",44
33836,LEO, The funny thing is,44
33837,JERRY,"  I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.",44
33838,LEO," Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go.",44
33839,JERRY," We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.",44
33840,LEO, Nobody got a gun to your head!,44
33841,JERRY,"  Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh.",44
33842,LEO," Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment, go to your appointment.",44
33843,JERRY," I'm sorry, really.",44
33844,LEO," You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!",44
33845,JERRY," Sorry, really.",44
33846,KRAMER,  Yeah?,44
33847,NEWMAN," Come on, are you ready? Let's go!",44
33848,KRAMER, For what?,44
33849,NEWMAN, What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.,44
33850,KRAMER, what about?,44
33851,NEWMAN, The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.,44
33852,KRAMER," I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.",44
33853,NEWMAN," You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.",44
33854,KRAMER," Well, I can't!",44
33855,NEWMAN," Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!",44
33856,KRAMER, Shut up! I'll get my coat!,44
33857,KRAMER, Don't step on anything.,44
33858,JERRY, You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.,44
33859,GEORGE, I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.,44
33860,JERRY," You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go",44
33861,GEORGE, Look at this.,44
33862,JERRY, Why didn't you shave this morning?,44
33863,GEORGE, 'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.,44
33864,JERRY, Why?,44
33865,GEORGE, Because of the day before. It's a long story.,44
33866,JERRY, Is that Joe Davola?,44
33867,GEORGE, It's not him!,44
33868,JERRY, I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.,44
33869,JERRY, Oh.,44
33870,GEORGE, Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?,44
33871,JERRY," All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.",44
33872,GEORGE, Okay. A little.,44
33873,NEWMAN," Okay, you're all set? You got your story?",44
33874,KRAMER, No.,44
33875,NEWMAN," When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.",44
33876,KRAMER, Uhm...,44
33877,NEWMAN," Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.",44
33878,KRAMER, I never had an air conditioner.,44
33879,NEWMAN, No! That's no reason to kill yourself!,44
33880,KRAMER," Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?",44
33881,NEWMAN," Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.",44
33882,KRAMER," Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.",44
33883,NEWMAN," No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.",44
33884,KRAMER, I was never able to become a banker.,44
33885,NEWMAN, Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.,44
33886,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.",44
33887,NEWMAN, You must be banker.,44
33888,KRAMER, MUST be banker.,44
33889,NEWMAN ," Okay, we'll go with the banker story.",44
33890,GEORGE, The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.,44
33891,RUSSEL, And people really have to care about the characters.,44
33892,GEORGE," Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?",44
33893,JERRY, Wouldn't tune in.,44
33894,GEORGE, Would they tune in?,44
33895,JERRY, No tune.,44
33896,RUSSEL, We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG. You have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down.,44
33897,GEORGE, The show will be like a heart attack!,44
33898,JERRY, Just a huge massive coronary.,44
33899,RUSSEL," So what you said last week about no story, you're a little flexible on that now.",44
33900,GEORGE, Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.,44
33901,JERRY, He couldn't believe it.,44
33902,GEORGE,"  I said, I said",44
33903,JUDGE, And then what happened?,44
33904,RUSSEL, Look. I don't know how you two guys feel but we would really like to be in business with you.,44
33905,GEORGE," Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.",44
33906,JERRY, We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.,44
33907,GEORGE, Yeah!,44
33908,JERRY, Your off-Broadway play.,44
33909,GEORGE," Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.",44
33910,JERRY,"  Hmm, hmm.",44
33911,GEORGE, That's my vow to you.,44
33912,RUSSEL," Well, I got a feeling about you two. And even more than that. I place a great deal of confidence in that lady's judgment.",44
33913,GEORGE, Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.,44
33914,JERRY," Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.",44
33915,RUSSEL,"  So, let's make a pilot.",44
33916,NEWMAN, I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.,44
33917,JUDGE, I don't understand.,44
33918,NEWMAN," You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...",44
33919,KRAMER,  Yo-yo Ma!,44
33920,NEWMAN," So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.",44
33921,JUDGE, So then he didn't kill himself.,44
33922,NEWMAN, No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today,44
33923,GEORGE, See?,44
33924,JERRY, Yeah!,44
33925,GEORGE," I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!",44
33926,JERRY," Now, all we gotta do is write it.",44
33927,GEORGE, Yes! How're we gonna do that?,44
33928,SUSAN, Hey! Congratulations!,44
33929,JERRY, Thanks.,44
33930,GEORGE," Oh, thank you.",44
33931,JERRY," Thank you, thanks.",44
33932,GEORGE," Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.",44
33933,SUSAN, No.,44
33934,JERRY, Phone call? Who knows I'm here?,44
33935,GEORGE, When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.,44
33936,SUSAN," Oh, it was only vomit.",44
33937,GEORGE," Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.",44
33938,SUSAN," Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber",44
33939,GEORGE," No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.",44
33940,SUSAN," Well, it was eighteen dollars.",44
33941,GEORGE," Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.",44
33942,SUSAN, Yeah. Call me.,44
33943,GEORGE," All right, great.",44
33944,SUSAN, Bye.,44
33945,JERRY, Bye thanks.,44
33946,GEORGE,"  Bye, thanks.  I can't believe she took the money.",44
33947,JERRY, Why?,44
33948,GEORGE, I offered to pay. She should've said no.,44
33949,JERRY," She did, you insisted.",44
33950,GEORGE," Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.",44
33951,JERRY, Nah!,44
33952,GEORGE," How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?",44
33953,JERRY," oh, I d-I don't know. I d---",44
33954,GEORGE," Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.",44
33955,JERRY, Okay.,44
33956,GEORGE,"  All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.",44
33957,GEORGE, Thirteen thousand?,44
33958,JERRY, Thirteen thousand.,44
33959,GEORGE, a piece?,44
33960,JERRY," No, for both!",44
33961,GEORGE, That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.,44
33962,JERRY," Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?",44
33963,GEORGE," Well, he does.",44
33964,JERRY, You're nuts!,44
33965,GEORGE, I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?,44
33966,JERRY, He's somebody.,44
33967,GEORGE, What about me?,44
33968,JERRY, You're nobody.,44
33969,GEORGE, Why him? Why not me?,44
33970,JERRY," He's good, you're not.",44
33971,GEORGE, I'm better than him.,44
33972,JERRY," You're worse, much much worse.  That's Davola!",44
33973,GEORGE,  What? Where? Where?,44
33974,JERRY, Outside! I saw him outside!,44
33975,ELAINE, what is it?,44
33976,BOYFRIEND," Oh, it's this patient.",44
33977,ELAINE,  Again?,44
33978,BOYFRIEND, I'm fairly certain. I forgot to leave him an extra prescription for his medication.,44
33979,ELAINE," Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.",44
33980,BOYFRIEND," Nah, you don't understand. He could be dangerous.",44
33981,JERRY, Go outside and see if he's still there.,44
33982,GEORGE," I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.",44
33983,JERRY," Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.",44
33984,GEORGE, Tell the cop.,44
33985,JERRY, Good idea.,44
33986,COP," Yeah, all right. Just let me get a muffin.",44
33987,JERRY, Thanks.,44
33988,JERRY,  He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.,44
33989,GEORGE, I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.,44
33990,JERRY,  What are you doing?,44
33991,COP, What?,44
33992,JERRY," What, are you ordering food now?",44
33993,COP," Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich.",44
33994,JERRY, What happened to the muffin?,44
33995,COP, I got a little hungry.,44
33996,JERRY, All of a sudden you get hungry?,44
33997,COP, Yeah! You got a problem with that?,44
33998,JERRY, No! Enjoy your lunch.,44
33999,GEORGE, I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.,44
34000,JERRY, All of a sudden he gets hungry.,44
34001,GEORGE," You know, a muffin can be very filling.",44
34002,JERRY, I know!,44
34003,NEWMAN,"  Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?",44
34004,KRAMER, What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?,44
34005,NEWMAN, You know what I mean.,44
34006,KRAMER,  I was very upset that day.,44
34007,NEWMAN, And why was that?,44
34008,KRAMER,  Would you let me say it? Let me talk!,44
34009,NEWMAN," All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.",44
34010,KRAMER, All right.,44
34011,NEWMAN, Okay.,44
34012,KRAMER,  I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.,44
34013,NEWMAN, And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.,44
34014,KRAMER,"  Uh, yeah.",44
34015,NEWMAN," It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...",44
34016,JUDGE, Mister Newman.,44
34017,NEWMAN," Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.",44
34018,JUDGE," Uh, continue.",44
34019,NEWMAN," As you were saying, Mister Kramer...",44
34020,KRAMER, What was the question?,44
34021,NEWMAN, You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.,44
34022,KRAMER," Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said",44
34023,NEWMAN," But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?",44
34024,KRAMER, I don't know.,44
34025,NEWMAN, It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?,44
34026,JUDGE," Uh, could you get to the speeding?",44
34027,NEWMAN," Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?",44
34028,KRAMER,  Phone call?,44
34029,NEWMAN," Yes, a phone call!",44
34030,KRAMER, From who?,44
34031,NEWMAN, From me!,44

34034,KRAMER, You called me?,44
34035,NEWMAN," Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?",44
34036,KRAMER, what?,44
34037,NEWMAN, You were going to...,44
34038,JUDGE, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call a---,44
34039,NEWMAN," Yes, the banker!!!",44
34040,KRAMER, What banking?,44
34041,NEWMAN," A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...",44
34042,JUDGE, That's enough already.,44
34043,NEWMAN," Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught.",44
34044,KRAMER, I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo!,44
34045,NEWMAN,  You shut up!  I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.,44
34046,JUDGE, That'll be seventy-five dollars.,44
34047,NEWMAN,  What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!,44
34048,JERRY, Do you see him?,44
34049,GEORGE, I'm not* sure.,44
34050,JERRY," Well, either you see him or you don't.",44

34055,COP, Yeah.,44
34056,JERRY, This is really too much.,44
34057,COP, What is your problem?,44
34058,JERRY," Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.",44
34059,COP," Well, you're just gonna have to wait.",44
34060,KRAMER, Never said anything about the banking.,44
34061,NEWMAN, You're off your rocker.,44
34062,JERRY, Hey you guys!,44
34063,KRAMER, Hey!,44

34075,KRAMER," You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?",44
34076,JERRY, No.,44
34077,NEWMAN, Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?,44
34078,GEORGE, What's the difference? The money is not important.,44
34079,JERRY,"  Hey Newman, is that your red car?",44
34080,NEWMAN, Yeah.,44
34081,JERRY, I think you're getting a ticket.,44
34082,NEWMAN, Deh!,44
34083,KRAMER," Run, run! Go, go, go!",44
34084,NEWMAN," Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.",44
34085,KRAMER, I saw the whole thing!,44
34086,JERRY, Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.,44
34087,GEORGE," Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.",44
34088,JERRY," Oh, like you know what you're talking about!",44

34231,JERRY, Be right back. ,45
34232,JERRY," There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it.  So don't mention it again, okay!",45
34233,KRAMER," Y-Yeah, all right.",45

34238,HELEN, How can anyone not like him.													 													 ,45
34239,MORTY," Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.",45
34240,RECEPTIONIST," Yes, Mr. Seinfeld. Would you please fill this out.",45
34241,MORTY, All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.,45
34242,RECEPTIONIST, I know. It's very long.,45
34243,MORTY, Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa.  My back was fine.,45
34244,HELEN," Well, it's not the sofa.",45
34245,MORTY, You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.,45
34246,HELEN, We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store.,45
34247,MORTY, Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued.  I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.,45
34248,HELEN, Leo says he's the best there is.,45
34249,MORTY," Leo, I'm listening to Leo now!",45
34250,HELEN, Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?,45
34251,MORTY," Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . .  Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.",45
34252,RECEPTIONIST," Julie, you want to take him back?													 													 ",45
34253,JERRY, You what? You passed? How could you do that?,45
34254,GEORGE," ahhhhh  Jerry, my young friend, you're so naïve. You are so, so naïve. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating.  Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business.",45
34255,JERRY," Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show.",45
34256,GEORGE," Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show.",45
34257,JERRY," We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?",45
34258,GEORGE, Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!,45
34259,JERRY," Well, I think you're wrong.",45
34260,GEORGE," Well, we'll just see.",45
34261,JERRY, Yes we will.,45
34262,GEORGE, Yes we will.,45

34265,JERRY, So good for you.,45
34266,GEORGE, So good for you.													 													JERRY,45
34267,GEORGE, What are you repeating everything I'm saying?,45
34268,JERRY, Well George is an idiot.,45
34269,GEORGE, Well George . . . .													 													 ,45
34270,MORTY," All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . . Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.",45
34271,HELEN,  Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you.,45
34272,MORTY, Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes.,45
34273,HELEN, Well the doctor must be busy.,45
34274,MORTY," Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel.",45
34275,NURSE," Hello, Mr. Seinfeld.",45

34277,NURSE, We didn't forget.,45
34278,MORTY, HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.,45
34279,NURSE," Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, please come this way. We need some X-rays.",45
34280,MORTY, Leave all my stuff here?,45

34331,GEORGE," Yeah, I saw it.",45
34332,ELAINE, What?,45
34333,JERRY, It's a tell. You gotta tell.,45
34334,ELAINE, What tell? What's a tell?,45
34335,JERRY," When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.",45
34336,ELAINE," Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?",45
34337,JERRY," Good, going good  And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out.  ",45
34338,ELAINE, How high did I go?,45
34339,GEORGE, You almost did the nose.,45
34340,JERRY, What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. ,45
34341,GEORGE, What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.,45
34342,JERRY,  You're off bread.   So what happened is it over?,45
34343,ELAINE, No not quite.,45
34344,JERRY, Why not?,45
34345,ELAINE," Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.",45
34346,GEORGE," What do you mean - ""Not letting you?""",45
34347,ELAINE," He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.",45
34348,JERRY, Svengali.,45
34349,ELAINE, What did I say?,45
34350,JERRY, Svenjolly.,45
34351,ELAINE, Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly.,45
34352,JERRY, George?,45
34353,GEORGE, Svenjolly. ,45
34354,ELAINE, I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.,45
34355,JERRY," Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.",45
34356,KRAMER, You know I can't find a match anywhere.,45
34357,GEORGE, You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing  somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.,45
34358,ELAINE," No, it's not going to work with this guy.",45
34359,GEORGE," No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life.",45
34360,ELAINE, I don't think so.,45
34361,JERRY, Nice try.,45
34362,GEORGE, Took a shot.,45

34367,NURSE, Are you sure?,45

34369,DR. DEMBROW," Mr. Seinfeld, I'm Dr. Dembrow, I've been going over your X-rays.",45

34379,DR. DEMBROW," All right, fine. ",45
34380,HELEN, The least you could have done was heard your diagnosis.,45
34381,MORTY, I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.,45
34382,HELEN, You came all the way from Florida to see him.,45
34383,MORTY, I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.													 													 ,45
34384,ELAINE, I'm sorry but there's somebody else.,45
34385,DR. RESTON, Umm hm.,45
34386,ELAINE," Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.",45
34387,DR. RESTON, Tell me about him.,45
34388,ELAINE," Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.",45
34389,DR. RESTON," Yes, well I assumed he's a guy.",45
34390,ELAINE, Right...,45

34402,DR. RESTON," Elaine, I'm concerned about you.",45
34403,ELAINE," Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.",45
34404,DR. RESTON, Elaine. Have you been urinating a lot again?,45
34405,ELAINE, . . . no.,45
34406,DR. RESTON," And how often have you been seeing, um . . .? I'm sorry what is his name?",45

34410,DR. RESTON, Are you afraid to tell me his name?,45
34411,ELAINE," No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.",45
34412,DR. RESTON, It doesn't matter if you don't see how. I see how.,45
34413,ELAINE," Uh, his name, um, I don't  - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.",45
34414,DR. RESTON, Kramer. Is that his first name or his last name?,45

34416,DR. RESTON," Elaine, I want you to do me a favor.",45
34417,ELAINE, What?,45
34418,DR. RESTON, I want you to tell this young man to give me a call. It's very important that I speak to him.,45
34419,ELAINE," Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that.",45

34423,ELAINE," Okay, okay.  Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call.													 													 ",45
34424,JERRY, So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?,45
34425,MORTY, I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.,45
34426,HELEN, Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?,45
34427,MORTY, What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?,45
34428,HELEN, You could've taken it with you.,45
34429,MORTY," Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.",45
34430,LEO, Hello...,45
34431,JERRY, Hi Uncle Leo.,45
34432,LEO, I just talked to Dr. Dembrow's son. He said they almost had to call the police.,45
34433,MORTY, What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.,45
34434,LEO, You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.,45
34435,MORTY," All right, Leo.",45
34436,LEO, And you walked out without paying.,45
34437,MORTY, How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.,45
34438,LEO," Well, I hope you send him a check.",45
34439,MORTY, What for?,45
34440,LEO, What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.,45
34441,MORTY," That's the second time you said ""personal favor"". Why do you keep saying that?",45
34442,LEO, I said it once.,45
34443,MORTY, Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.,45
34444,HELEN," Leo, where did you get that watch?",45
34445,LEO, You know where I got this?  I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?,45
34446,HELEN," Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.",45
34447,JERRY," Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .",45
34448,HELEN, Let me see that.,45
34449,JERRY, Could we continue this another time.,45
34450,JERRY,"JERRY: It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. ""It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad."" But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, ""I refuse to put any thought into this at all."" Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?",46
34451,MORTY,"  I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman.  He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.",46
34452,JERRY," Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.",46
34453,HELEN,  She's very attractive.,46
34454,JERRY, She's okay.,46
34455,HELEN, Just okay?,46
34456,JERRY, She's nice.,46
34457,HELEN, She's better than nice.,46
34458,JERRY, She's all right.,46
34459,HELEN, She's beautiful.,46
34460,JERRY, She's not beautiful.,46
34461,HELEN, I think she's beautiful.,46
34462,JERRY, So you ask her out.,46
34463,HELEN, I'm not gonna ask her out.,46
34464,JERRY, Why not?,46
34465,HELEN," If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.",46
34466,JERRY, She's pretty. She's not beautiful.,46
34467,HELEN, I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.,46
34468,JERRY, I think that's a little extreme.,46
34469,LEO,  She's awright.,46
34470,MORTY,"  Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.",46
34471,GEORGE, He said what?,46
34472,SUSAN," ""The hell with them.""",46
34473,GEORGE," ""The hell with them?""",46
34474,SUSAN, Those were his exact words.,46
34475,GEORGE,  Oh boy.,46
34476,SUSAN," He said, ""We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?""",46
34477,GEORGE,  He was pretty emphatic?,46
34478,SUSAN, Pounded on his desk.,46
34479,GEORGE, Pounded?,46
34480,SUSAN,  I told you to take the offer.,46
34481,GEORGE,"  Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.",46
34482,SUSAN, You said it was insulting.,46

34608,GEORGE," Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.",46
34609,CYNTHIA,"  Russell, where's the TV Guide.",46

34624,LEO," Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it.",46
34625,JERRY," Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!",46

34777,GEORGE, You're kidding.,46
34778,JERRY," He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.",46
34779,GEORGE," Man, would I like to see the look on his face.",46
34780,MORTY, You believe this?,46

34783,HELEN, You're kidding.,46
34784,MORTY, Who needs this?,46
34785,MORTY," Leo, let's go.",46
34786,JERRY," ...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, ""Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now."" ""This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration."" You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration,  ""Here's fifty-six people that know me."" Cop goes. ""Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check.""",46
34787,JERRY," Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone?  You wanted the machine.  You know, and you're always kind of thrown off,  you go ""Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you.""",47
34788,JERRY, Well this is it.,47
34789,NAOMI," Oh, this is nice. Thanks again for the Chinese food.",47
34790,JERRY," Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.",47
34791,NAOMI," Yeah, me too.",47
34792,JERRY," No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.",47
34793,NAOMI,"  - Nnnhhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha . Oh, you know what? I think Naked Gun is on. Oh I've seen it. I laughed through that whole thing. You wanna watch?",47
34794,JERRY," No, I mean, I don't think so.",47
34795,NAOMI, I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you were happy go lucky.,47
34796,JERRY," No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.",47
34797,NAOMI, Ahahahahahahahahaha.,47
34798,JERRY, That's not funny Naomi.,47
34799,NAOMI, Ah hahahaha. ,47
34800,JERRY," I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.",47
34801,GEORGE,"  Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.",47
34802,GEORGE,"  All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?",47
34803,GEORGE,"  A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...",47
34804,JERRY, This thing has never worked right. ,47
34805,NAOMI," You think I, laugh like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?",47
34806,JERRY," Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. ""I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa "" Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ...  it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.",47
34807,JERRY, How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?,47
34808,GEORGE, Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?,47
34809,JERRY, Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!,47
34810,GEORGE," Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.",47
34811,JERRY," Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.",47
34812,GEORGE," What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.",47
34813,JERRY," Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.",47
34814,GEORGE, Wh-Well maybe you should ask Elaine.,47
34815,JERRY," Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.",47
34816,GEORGE," Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.",47
34817,JERRY," Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?",47
34818,KRAMER, Hmm.,47
34819,JERRY," Ah, Kramer.",47
34820,KRAMER," Hello boys,  top of the morning to ya. What do you say?													What do ya be?",47
34821,JERRY, Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.,47
34822,KRAMER," So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?",47
34823,KRAMER, Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.,47
34824,JERRY, Westchester? Isn't that a private club?,47
34825,KRAMER," Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.",47
34826,JERRY, and GEORGE,47
34827,KRAMER," Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend.  Ffoooo ",47

34846,ELAINE, What's that?,47
34847,JERRY," Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.",47

34864,JERRY, I love Yoo Hoo.,47
34865,MEL," Yes, it's a fine product. Anyway I saw you on the Tonight Show a couple weeks ago. I was watching the show with my son Donald. He's got this rare immune deficiency in his blood ... the damnedest thing. Doctors say he has to live in a plastic bubble. Can you imagine that? A bubble.",47
34866,JERRY, A bubble?,47
34867,ELAINE, A bubble?,47
34868,MEL," Yes, a bubble!",47
34869,MEL, Do you mind? May I?,47
34870,ELAINE," Oh, sure.",47
34871,MEL," Ah, It'd break your heart seein' him in there. It's like a prisoner. No friends - just his mother and me. And I'm out there six days a week haulin' Yoo Hoo. We have sacrificed everything. All for the sake of our little ... bubble boy.",47
34872,MEL,"  Excuse me, I ah ...",47
34873,ELAINE, Oh right here ,47
34874,MEL," Excuse me, anyway we were watching ya on TV.",47

34904,SUSAN, Oh.,47
34905,GEORGE, What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?,47
34906,JERRY," That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.  It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.",47
34907,SUSAN," Well, where does he live?",47

34914,GEORGE,  hu hu.,47

34933,JERRY, What's he doing? What is his hurry?,47
34934,ELAINE, Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.,47
34935,JERRY, I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.													I-I never heard the end of it,47

34956,SUSAN, We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!,47

34976,SUSAN, What's the matter?,47

35008,GEORGE," Can you uh, go in the bubble?",47

35128,ELAINE, How could this have happened?,47
35129,KRAMER,"  ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ...",47
35130,NAOMI," Oh, my god, the cabin?",47
35131,JERRY, What are you two doin' here?,47

35136,GEORGE, No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.,48
35137,JERRY," ""We're""? What do you mean, ""We're""?",48
35138,GEORGE, Susan wants me to be there.,48
35139,JERRY, You're meetin' the father for the first time?,48
35140,GEORGE,  Yeah.,48
35141,JERRY,"  Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.",48
35142,GEORGE, I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!,48
35143,JERRY,"  I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it",48
35144,GEORGE," Yeah, I know what happened.",48
35145,JERRY," No, but wait, wait",48
35146,GEORGE,  I know.,48
35147,JERRY,"  ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars!  It's very comical..",48
35148,GEORGE," Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.",48
35149,JERRY,"  No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.",48
35150,GEORGE,"  I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..",48
35151,JERRY,"  C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.",48
35152,GEORGE, We could build a cabin like  that.,48
35153,JERRY,"  Well, maybe not us, but two men could.",48
35154,GEORGE,"  Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?",48
35155,JERRY," What, you got a problem with the pen now?",48
35156,GEORGE," Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.",48
35157,JERRY," Alright, let's just get to work.  NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.",48
35158,GEORGE,"  So, you're gonna sit there?",48
35159,JERRY,"  Just - just park yourself.  Alright. Act I, Scene A.",48
35160,GEORGE,  Drink?,48
35161,JERRY," No, no thank you.",48
35162,GEORGE,"  Alright, here we go.",48
35163,JERRY," Act I, Scene A..",48
35164,GEORGE, Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?,48
35165,JERRY,"  Yes.  Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold.  Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes.  Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it.  I'll be off in a minute!  Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks!  Are you thinking of ideas?  Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes.  So we're on for later?",48
35166,ELAINE," Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here..  Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go.  Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?",48
35167,JERRY," Okay, let's go. ",48
35168,GEORGE," Alright, here we go. You got it?",48
35169,JERRY, Yeah.,48
35170,GEORGE, Here we go.,48
35171,JERRY," Okay, how about this",48
35172,GEORGE,"  It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?",48
35173,ELAINE," Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?",48
35174,SANDRA, Why? Did Jerry say something?,48
35175,ELAINE," No, no.",48
35176,SANDRA, He must have said something.,48
35177,ELAINE," Oh, no, he didn't say anything.",48
35178,SANDRA,  I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving. ,48
35179,ELAINE,"  No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!",48
35180,GEORGE," Alright, let's go.",48
35181,JERRY, Here we go.,48
35182,KRAMER, Hey.,48
35183,GEORGE," yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..",48
35184,JERRY," Yeah, come on.  What's with you?",48
35185,KRAMER,  No more golf.,48
35186,JERRY, Why?,48
35187,KRAMER," Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?",48
35188,JERRY, Yeah.,48
35189,KRAMER,"  Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire!  Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?",48
35190,GEORGE," What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!",48
35191,KRAMER, Why? What's one thing got to do with another?,48
35192,GEORGE," Kramer, please.",48
35193,KRAMER," Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!",48
35194,GEORGE," Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.",48
35195,KRAMER,  Where? They're Cubans. ,48
35196,GEORGE,  You know what? Maybe I should take off.,48
35197,JERRY, What?!,48
35198,GEORGE," Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.",48
35199,JERRY,  You got four hours! What about the script?,48
35200,GEORGE, I think we got a bite on it. ,48
35201,MRS. ROSS,"  Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?",48
35202,MR. ROSS,  A slight resemblance.,48
35203,MRS. ROSS,"  Her son's a podiatrist, you know.",48
35204,GEORGE," Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..",48
35205,MR. ROSS, How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?,48
35206,GEORGE," Oh, uh, the cigars..  I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.",48
35207,MR. ROSS, You know those cigars are made special for Castro?,48
35208,GEORGE,  I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. ,48
35209,MR. ROSS, What?,48
35210,SUSAN,"  He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.",48
35211,MR. ROSS, I didn't care much for his jokes.,48
35212,SUSAN,  Daddy never laughs.,48
35213,GEORGE," Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going ""Ha, ha!""? What is that? ""Ha, ha!""?",48
35214,MR. ROSS," You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere.",48
35215,MRS. ROSS, You and your cigars..,48
35216,MR. ROSS,  Wear some more lipstick.,48
35217,SUSAN," Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..",48
35218,MR. ROSS," Oh, I forgot to ask you - how'd you like the cabin?",48
35219,GEORGE,"  Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, ",48
35220,JERRY," Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!",48
35221,ELAINE,  I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?,48
35222,JERRY,  Ohh.. dial the number.  How could you do this?,48
35223,ELAINE,  I was just trying to help you.,48
35224,JERRY,"  Oh, just trying to  help me..  Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld.  Listen, I - I just want to tell you,  There's been a terrible misunderstanding",48
35225,GEORGE, The cabin..  Well..  Susan?,48
35226,SUSAN, Uhh.. about the cabin..,48
35227,MR. ROSS,"  I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were,  ""Cherish the cabin."" Not, uh, ""Take care of your sister.""  She's a paraplegic. But, ""Cherish the cabin.""  And I have.. for 45 years. It's often been a.. sanctuary for me.",48
35228,GEORGE,  Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.,48
35229,MR. ROSS, What?,48
35230,GEORGE," S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..",48
35231,MR. ROSS," When I go, I'm passing it on to her. ",48
35232,MRS. ROSS,  I'll take a hotel any day.,48
35233,SUSAN, Daddy..,48
35234,MR. ROSS, Yes?,48
35235,SUSAN," Daddy, about the cabin..",48
35236,MRS. ROSS,"  Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! ",48
35237,MR. ROSS,  What about it?,48
35238,SUSAN," Well, the thing is..",48
35239,MR. ROSS, What? What is it?,48
35240,SUSAN," Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?",48
35241,GEORGE,  Burned.,48
35242,MR. ROSS, Burned?,48
35243,SUSAN," There was a fire, and it uh..",48
35244,GEORGE, Burned.,48
35245,MR. ROSS,  The cabin burned?,48
35246,GEORGE,"  yeah, burned. Whoo..",48
35247,MRS. ROSS,  Burned! ,48
35248,MR. ROSS, Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?,48
35249,SUSAN,  No. Nothing.,48
35250,MRS. ROSS,"  Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.",48
35251,GEORGE," Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical..  Really. Think about it.",48
35252,SANDRA,  I can't believe you said that!,48
35253,JERRY, What?!,48
35254,SANDRA,  How could you say something like that to me?!,48
35255,JERRY, What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!,48
35256,SANDRA, That was a weird thing to say.,48
35257,JERRY, Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.,48
35258,SANDRA," Ohh, I think you're really sick.",48
35259,JERRY,  I'm not sick.  You - you said much sicker things than me.,48
35260,SANDRA, I'm leaving. ,48
35261,JERRY, I really think you're making too much of this.,48
35262,SANDRA,  Excuse me. ,48
35263,JERRY, Let me walk you to a cab.,48
35264,SANDRA,  That's ok.,48
35265,JERRY," I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.",48
35266,SANDRA," Oh, really? ",48
35267,JERRY,"  I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.",48
35268,JERRY," So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.",48
35269,GEORGE, Wo-hoah! What did you do?,48
35270,JERRY,  Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?,48
35271,GEORGE," Yeah, right.",48
35272,JERRY," I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, ""That hand should not be on my leg."" But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, ""Would you mind?!""",48
35273,GEORGE," Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?",48
35274,JERRY," I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..",48
35275,GEORGE," Alright, so, go ahead.",48
35276,JERRY, So we go back to my apartment..,48
35277,GEORGE,  Woah. Whoa! Woah!,48
35278,JERRY," So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate..  and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.",48
35279,GEORGE,"  Alright, alright, hold on!  Time out! Woah, woah!  What did she say?",48
35280,JERRY,"  Oh, you know, the usual..",48
35281,GEORGE," No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?",48
35282,JERRY, Typical things.,48
35283,GEORGE,  What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.,48
35284,JERRY," She says, uh.. ",48
35285,GEORGE,  That's very dirty.  That's absolutely filthy.,48
35286,JERRY, ..And then she starts talking about her panties.,48
35287,GEORGE,  Gonna need some water here!,48
35288,JERRY, So I said something.,48
35289,GEORGE," Ok, what did you say?",48
35290,JERRY,"  Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.",48
35291,GEORGE, Of course.,48
35292,JERRY," Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, ""You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?""",48
35293,GEORGE,"  ""The panties your mother laid out for you""?  What does that mean?",48
35294,JERRY,  I don't know! It just popped out.,48
35295,GEORGE," Well, how did she react?",48
35296,JERRY, She flipped out! Just left.,48
35297,GEORGE," Well, that's not offensive.  It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.",48
35298,JERRY," Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.",48
35299,JERRY," She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that?  Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?",48
35300,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.",48
35301,JERRY, I guess he failed to see the humor in it.,48
35302,GEORGE," Huh.  C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.",48
35303,JERRY,"  Alright, big work day.",48
35304,GEORGE, That's right.,48
35305,GEORGE, Okay.,48
35306,JERRY, Let's go.,48
35307,GEORGE, Here we are.,48
35308,JERRY, Right now.,48
35309,GEORGE, Let's do it.,48
35310,JERRY, You and me.,48
35311,GEORGE, Okay.,48
35312,JERRY, Alright.,48
35313,GEORGE, What'dya got?,48
35314,JERRY,  I got,48
35315,KRAMER," Oh, hey.",48
35316,GEORGE, Don't be silly.,48
35317,JERRY," Come in, we're taking a break.",48
35318,KRAMER,"  Oh, yeah?",48
35319,JERRY, Yeah!,48

35556,JOE DIVOLA," Do you think I?m a clown, Nedda?",49
35557,ELAINE," Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.",49
35558,JOE DIVOLA," You've betrayed me with another, haven't you, Nedda? Who is he. I want you to tell me who he is. I want his name. Tell me his name.",49
35559,ELAINE," Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.",49
35560,JOE DIVOLA, Pagliacci kills his wife.,49
35561,ELAINE," Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown",49
35562,JOE DIVOLA, You're not leaving,49
35563,JERRY,"  But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.",49
35564,JERRY,  Who is it?,49
35565,GEORGE, It's George.,49
35566,GEORGE," What, are you locking the door now?",49
35567,JERRY," Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?",49
35568,GEORGE," Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.",49
35569,JERRY," Ooo, that was a bad toast.",49
35570,GEORGE, It wasn't that bad.,49
35571,JERRY, I never heard anybody curse in a toast.,49
35572,GEORGE, I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.,49
35573,JERRY," There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.",49
35574,GEORGE," Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.",49
35575,JERRY, What do you mean not going? why not?,49
35576,GEORGE," I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.",49
35577,JERRY, Why doesn't she pay for hers?,49
35578,GEORGE," That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?",49
35579,JERRY, It's nice to get a reach.,49
35580,JERRY, Who is it?,49
35581,KRAMER, It's me!,49
35582,KRAMER," What, are you locking the door now?",49
35583,JERRY, Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?,49
35584,KRAMER, I am dressed.,49
35585,JERRY, You're going like this?,49
35586,KRAMER, Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.,49
35587,JERRY, I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!,49
35588,KRAMER," People do, I don't.",49
35589,JERRY," Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.",49
35590,GEORGE," Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!",49
35591,JERRY, Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?,49
35592,GEORGE," That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!",49
35593,JERRY," All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.",49
35594,JERRY, Would you turn that down! What is that crap!,49
35595,KRAMER, It's Pagliacci!,49
35596,JERRY," Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.",49
35597,KRAMER, Why? What happened?,49
35598,JERRY, Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.,49

35620,JERRY," Oh yeah, well why don?t you Just get lost.",49

35660,ELAINE," I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.",49
35661,JERRY," Oh my god, its Joe Divola",49

35665,JERRY," Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!",49
35666,ELAINE," Oooohh, what about me!",49
35667,JOE DIVOLA, Excuse me,49
35668,GEORGE, But this is Pavarotti!,49
35669,MR REICHMAN," You know Steven Holstman  did a production at Tunis last yeas and from what I understand, the Moslems really took to it.",49
35670,GEORGE," All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.",49
35671,MR REICHMAN, Scalping! I told them to put out extra security.. Excuse me.,49
35672,GEORGE," Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.",49

35676,MRS REICHMAN," Harold, no, Harold, Harold be careful of you're hair transplant!",49
35677,JOE DIVOLA," Anything is welcome, I accept change.",49
35678,JERRY," I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.",49
35679,JOE DIVOLA," You know, you could just say no, you don't have to humiliate me. I may be dressed as a clown but I am a person.",49
35680,JERRY," I'm telling you, the guy took.....",49
35681,JOE DIVOLA, And I don't need people like you looking down their noses at me. I am just a street performer out here trying to make enough to get by.,49
35682,MRS REICHMAN, Doctor! Doctor! Is there a doctor anywhere!,49
35683,JOE DIVOLA," What, are you showing off to your girlfriend here, is that it?",49
35684,ELAINE," I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.",49
35685,JOE DIVOLA, You people make me sick.,49
35686,JERRY, That is one angry clown!,49
35687,JERRY," The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. ""Who was that clown?"", ""I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?"", ""The guy's a clown!"". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, ""What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!""",49
35688,JERRY,"  Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!",49
35689,ELAINE," You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.",49
35690,JERRY," Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.",49
35691,JOE DIVOLA, I don't want any money.,49
35692,ELAINE, I smell cherry.,49
35693,JOE DIVOLA, It's Binaca.,49
35694,JERRY, Binaca?,49
35695,GEORGE, What did we say? Two seventy-five?,49
35696,GEORGE, Two fifty? Are you sure,49
35697,GEORGE," All right, all right, two fifty.",49
35698,SUSAN, George!,49
35699,GEORGE, S-Susan,49
35700,SUSAN," I can't believe it, I?m so glad I caught you.",49
35701,GEORGE," What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.",49
35702,SUSAN," Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia.",49
35703,GEORGE," So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?",49
35704,SUSAN, She's coming in tomorrow. I made it!,49
35705,GEORGE," Yeah you made it, how about that.",49
35706,SUSAN," Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together.",49
35707,GEORGE, We get to go to the opera together!,49
35708,SUSAN, Who's that?,49
35709,GEORGE," That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.",49
35710,JERRY," Come on, you gotta let us in",49
35711,USHER, Not without tickets.,49
35712,JERRY," We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.",49
35713,USHER, Well that?s a problem. Excuse me.,49
35714,JERRY," You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.",49
35715,USHER, A crazy clown is after you? Oh that?s rich. Now clear the entrance so people with tickets can get through.,49
35716,KRAMER, Are you guys ready?,49
35717,KRAMER, Have you seen George?,49
35718,JERRY, We thought he was with you.,49
35719,ELAINE," Come on, he's on his own, come on!",49
35720,KRAMER, These are great seats huh?,49
35721,ELAINE, Yeah,49
35722,KRAMER, Yeah,49
35723,JERRY," Boy, some cast, huh? Pavarotti, Aver Martone.",49
35724,ELAINE," Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?",49
35725,JERRY," She's playing, Pagliacci?s wife, Nedda.",49
35726,ELAINE, Nedda?,49
35727,JERRY, Yeah.,49
35728,ELAINE, Oh my god..,49
35729,JERRY, Susan! What are you doing here?,49
35730,SUSAN, My Friend's flight couldn?t make it.,49
35731,JERRY, Where's George?,49
35732,SUSAN, He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.,49
35733,JERRY," Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?",49
35734,JERRY," Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to?",49
35735,KRAMER, Some nut in a clown suit!,49
35736,JERRY," I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.",49
35737,JERRY, We're dead.,50
35738,GEORGE, We're not dead.,50
35739,JERRY, We are dead.,50
35740,GEORGE, Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.,50
35741,JERRY, All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.,50
35742,GEORGE, So we'll do it tomorrow.,50
35743,JERRY, Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?,50
35744,GEORGE, About six years ago.,50
35745,JERRY, I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.,50
35746,GEORGE, Women like skiers.,50
35747,JERRY, So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.,50
35748,GEORGE, Yeah. Right.,50
35749,JERRY," Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.",50
35750,GEORGE, The closet business? What's the closet business?,50
35751,JERRY, What is it your business?,50
35752,GEORGE, I'm interested.,50
35753,JERRY, She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.,50
35754,GEORGE, So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.,50
35755,JERRY, Yeah.,50
35756,GEORGE, Yeah. So what happened?,50
35757,JERRY," So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for?  Hi, Marla.",50
35758,MARLA,  Jerry.,50
35759,JERRY," George, Marla.",50
35760,GEORGE, Marla.,50
35761,MARLA," George. Jerry, Stacey.",50
35762,JERRY, Stacey.,50
35763,STACEY, Jerry.,50
35764,JERRY," George, Stacey.",50
35765,GEORGE, Stacey.,50
35766,STACEY, George.,50
35767,JERRY, George.,50
35768,GEORGE, Jerry. Marla.  Stacey! ,50
35769,MARLA," So, how was your trip to Berlin?",50
35770,JERRY, Trip to Berlin?,50
35771,MARLA, Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.,50
35772,JERRY," Oh, right, right.",50
35773,MARLA," The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.",50
35774,JERRY," Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, ""Why knock my brains out?""",50
35775,MARLA," You, know my boyfriend went.",50
35776,JERRY, Really?,50
35777,MARLA," Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.",50
35778,JERRY," Oh, did he like it?",50
35779,MARLA, I don't know. He never came back. ,50
35780,GEORGE," Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.",50
35781,STACEY," Wow, what a great job. A writer.",50
35782,GEORGE, Not a bad way to make a buck.,50
35783,STACEY, Sounds great.,50
35784,GEORGE," Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. ",50
35785,JERRY," So, are you gonna go out with her?",50
35786,GEORGE, I might.,50
35787,JERRY, What about Susan?,50
35788,GEORGE, What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?,50
35789,JERRY, Depends.,50
35790,GEORGE, Depends on what?,50
35791,JERRY, On many factors.,50
35792,GEORGE, Like what?,50
35793,JERRY," Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?",50
35794,GEORGE, No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.,50
35795,JERRY," What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?",50
35796,GEORGE, Implied.,50
35797,JERRY, She got anything in your medicine cabinet?,50
35798,GEORGE, There might be some moisturizer.,50
35799,JERRY, Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?,50
35800,GEORGE,  Yeah.,50
35801,JERRY," Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.",50
35802,GEORGE, What?,50
35803,JERRY, You got yourself a girlfriend.,50
35804,GEORGE," Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?",50
35805,JERRY," I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...",50
35806,GEORGE," Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, ""What do you do?"" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.",50
35807,JERRY, You're going to make a good father someday.,50
35808,GEORGE," Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.",50
35809,JERRY, Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?,50
35810,GEORGE," No, what?",50
35811,JERRY," The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.",50
35812,GEORGE, Why? What do you mean?,50
35813,JERRY," Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?",50
35814,GEORGE," Oh, right. Oh no, man.",50
35815,JERRY," you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?",50
35816,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.",50
35817,JERRY,"  Oh, yeah.",50
35818,GEORGE," Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.",50
35819,JERRY, This is your plan?,50
35820,GEORGE," No, no. I'm just thinking.",50
35821,JERRY, I don't think you are.,50
35822,MARLA, Let me tell you what I think.,50
35823,JERRY," Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.",50
35824,MARLA, Are you very fussy about your pants?,50
35825,JERRY, I don't think I am.,50
35826,MARLA, Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?,50
35827,JERRY, Try me.,50
35828,MARLA," Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.",50
35829,JERRY, Everything?,50
35830,MARLA," Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.",50
35831,JERRY," You're quite mad, you know.  Oh, I don't believe this.  Hey?",50
35832,KRAMER, Hey.,50
35833,JERRY, What are you doing?,50
35834,KRAMER, I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.,50
35835,JERRY, No.,50
35836,KRAMER, What?,50
35837,JERRY, This is not a good time.,50
35838,KRAMER, Five minutes. What?,50
35839,JERRY, What did you have to give your TV away to George for?,50
35840,KRAMER," Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.",50
35841,JERRY," Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. ",50
35842,KRAMER," Well, wow.",50
35843,JERRY," Marla, Kramer.",50
35844,KRAMER, Hey.,50
35845,JERRY, Why don't you go out? It's nice out.,50
35846,KRAMER," Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.",50
35847,JERRY, There's weather.,50
35848,KRAMER, Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.,50
35849,JERRY, I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.,50
35850,KRAMER," No, no, I don't want it back.  Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?",50
35851,JERRY, I don't know.,50
35852,KRAMER, Will you tape it?,50
35853,JERRY, Kramer... ,50
35854,KRAMER, Yeah. ,50
35855,JERRY, So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.,50
35856,MARLA, Never came back.,50
35857,JERRY," Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.",50
35858,MARLA, It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.,50
35859,JERRY, Ah hah.  Excuse me one second. Yeah?,50
35860,ELAINE, It's me.,50
35861,JERRY," Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now.  I'm sorry. What?",50
35862,ELAINE, I didn't get it.,50
35863,JERRY, Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.,50
35864,MARLA," Well, he wanted me to move in with him.",50
35865,JERRY, Snapple?,50
35866,MARLA, No thanks.,50
35867,JERRY, Go on.,50
35868,MARLA, Well I wouldn't move in because...,50
35869,JERRY, Yes.,50
35870,MARLA, Well because...,50
35871,JERRY, Yeah.,50
35872,MARLA, Well because I'm a virgin. ,50
35873,ELAINE, Hello!,50
35874,JERRY," Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.",50
35875,ELAINE," I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.",50
35876,JERRY," Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.",50
35877,ELAINE," I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.",50
35878,MARLA, I should be going.,50
35879,ELAINE," No, no, I'm leaving.",50
35880,JERRY, I like that thing in your hair there.,50
35881,ELAINE, Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?,50
35882,MARLA, No thanks.,50
35883,ELAINE," I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right?  Ahh.",50
35884,MARLA, I should be going.,50
35885,JERRY, So we'll talk about the hooks then?,50
35886,MARLA, Yes. ,50
35887,ELAINE, What? Was it something I said?,50
35888,JERRY," She's a virgin, she just told me.",50
35889,ELAINE, Well I didn't know.,50
35890,JERRY, Well it's not like spotting a toupee.,50
35891,ELAINE, Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?,50
35892,JERRY," No, no, I mean...",50
35893,ELAINE, 'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. ,50
35894,JERRY," Elaine, Elaine...  Yeah?",50
35895,GEORGE, It's George.,50
35896,GEORGE, She's a virgin?,50
35897,JERRY, A virgin.,50
35898,GEORGE, Wow. So what're you gonna do?,50
35899,JERRY," I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.",50
35900,GEORGE," I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.",50
35901,JERRY," You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.",50
35902,GEORGE," You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back.  I'm really hungry.",50
35903,JERRY," Yeah, me too.",50
35904,GEORGE, We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?,50
35905,JERRY," All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything.  Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything--  let me know what it is and I'll order for you.",50
35906,KRAMER, I'm in. Let's go for it.,50
35907,GEORGE, What do you want?,50
35908,KRAMER," I don't care, whatever.",50
35909,GEORGE, I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.,50
35910,KRAMER, Okay. What are you getting?,50
35911,GEORGE, I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.,50
35912,KRAMER, What's a Chow Fung?,50
35913,GEORGE, It's a broad noodle.,50
35914,KRAMER," What do you mean, a broad noodle?",50
35915,GEORGE, It's a big flat noodle.,50
35916,KRAMER, Well I don't want a big flat noodle.,50
35917,GEORGE, What kind of noodle do you want?,50
35918,KRAMER, Who says I want a noodle?,50
35919,GEORGE," All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.",50
35920,KRAMER, All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.,50
35921,GEORGE, Fine.,50
35922,KRAMER, Get extra MSG.,50
35923,ELAINE," Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.",50
35924,MARLA, So they just leave?,50
35925,ELAINE," Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.",50
35926,MARLA, Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.,50
35927,ELAINE, Eh.,50
35928,JERRY," All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.",50
35929,GEORGE, Where's the food? What happened to Ping?,50
35930,JERRY," Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting.  There's your food.",50
35931,GEORGE," Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?",50
35932,JERRY, Yeah.,50
35933,GEORGE," My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.",50
35934,JERRY, Your butler?,50
35935,GEORGE," Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.",50
35936,JERRY, What about me?,50
35937,GEORGE," Don't worry, we'll find something for you. ",50
35938,JERRY,"  That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler.  Ping, what happened?",50
35939,ELAINE, There was a bit of an accident.,50
35940,PING, Head hurts. Head really hurts.,50
35941,JERRY, What happened?,50
35942,ELAINE," Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.",50
35943,GEORGE, Something happened to the food?,50
35944,PING, I only saved one bag.,50
35945,JERRY, Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?,50
35946,MARLA, I'll get some ice.,50
35947,GEORGE,  The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? ,50
35948,KRAMER," Hey, you got the food?",50
35949,JERRY," Yeah, here.",50
35950,KRAMER," What took you so long? Hey, Ping!",50
35951,PING, Kramer. ,50
35952,KRAMER, Yeah. Where's yours?,50
35953,GEORGE, He dropped it.,50
35954,KRAMER," Oh, that's too bad.",50
35955,ELAINE," You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.",50
35956,PING," No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked.",50
35957,KRAMER,"  Hey, you watchin' Oprah?",50
35958,ELAINE,  I did not jaywalk.,50
35959,JERRY,  You're givin' him back that TV.,50
35960,PING,"  Yes, you jaywalked.",50
35961,KRAMER,"  No, I don't want it back.",50
35962,PING,  Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you.,50
35963,GEORGE,  We got work to do. What about the meeting?,50
35964,KRAMER,"  Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.",50
35965,JERRY," A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that  , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!",50
35966,GEORGE," All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.",50
35967,JERRY, What do you mean? They know we're here.,50
35968,GEORGE," I'll fake an illness.  My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.",50
35969,JERRY," No, no, would you get up?",50
35970,GEORGE," I can do this, Jerry.",50
35971,JERRY, No.,50
35972,GEORGE," All right, I'll tell them my sister died.  My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.",50
35973,JERRY, What?,50
35974,GEORGE, That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. ,50
35975,WOMAN," Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. ",50
35976,JERRY," Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. ",50
35977,JERRY," Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.",50
35978,RITA," Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson.",50
35979,JERRY," Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?",50
35980,RITA," He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of Blossom.",50
35981,JERRY," Oh, poor Blossom. ",50
35982,RITA," Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him.",50
35983,JERRY," Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.",50
35984,SUSAN, David Letterman's on the floor?,50
35985,JERRY," Yeah, he just walked by.",50
35986,RITA," Well, I think we should get started anyway.",50
35987,JERRY," Yeah, good idea.",50
35988,RITA, So how are you guys comin' along?,50
35989,JERRY," Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.",50
35990,RITA, Good. ,50
35991,JERRY," Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table.  Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?",50
35992,RITA, So that's the idea?,50
35993,JERRY," Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler.  You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.",50
35994,GEORGE," You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late.  Russell?",50
35995,RITA, I'm Rita Kearson.,50
35996,GEORGE," Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure.  Sweetie.  Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer?  I thought I was getting the butler.",50
35997,JERRY," Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.",50
35998,JERRY," So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?",50
35999,GEORGE," No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.",50
36000,KRAMER," You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.",50
36001,JERRY, Would you give him the TV back?,50
36002,KRAMER," Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.",50
36003,GEORGE, I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? ,50
36004,KRAMER,  Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!,50
36005,SUSAN, Hello?,50
36006,GEORGE," Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?",50
36007,SUSAN, What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!,50
36008,GEORGE, Fired? Why?,50
36009,SUSAN," Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.",50
36010,KRAMER,  What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.,50
36011,GEORGE, But I had no... I didn't realize.,50
36012,SUSAN," You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!",50
36013,GEORGE, I just feel terrible This is just terrible.,50
36014,KRAMER,"  What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.",50
36015,SUSAN, I'll speak to you later.,50
36016,GEORGE,"  this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!",50
36017,JERRY, Why did he fire her?,50
36018,GEORGE," Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!",50
36019,KRAMER," What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!",50
36020,JERRY, You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.,50
36021,GEORGE, What?,50
36022,JERRY, You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.,50
36023,GEORGE, Another job?,50
36024,JERRY, Couple of interviews.,50
36025,GEORGE," Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.",50
36026,MARLA," Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.",50
36027,JERRY, What? Leave? Where? Why?,50
36028,MARLA," You know, the apartment.",50
36029,JERRY, Why would I leave? This is my apartment.,50
36030,MARLA, Well what if it was my apartment?,50
36031,JERRY, Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?,50
36032,MARLA, Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.,50
36033,JERRY," Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.",50
36034,MARLA, Maybe I should get going.,50
36035,JERRY, What else did you say to her?,50
36036,ELAINE, Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.,50
36037,JERRY," More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.",50
36038,ELAINE," Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.",50
36039,JERRY, What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?,50
36040,ELAINE, You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.,50
36041,JERRY, I was trying to be.,50
36042,ELAINE," Look at George.  He lucked out, huh?",50
36043,JERRY," Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.",50
36044,ELAINE," Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.",50
36045,GEORGE," What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.",50
36046,WOMAN," A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.",50
36047,CAROL," A sitcom? Come on, let's go. ",50
36048,WOMAN, A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!,50
36049,JERRY,"...cramped seat, working on a tiny computer; there's always a small problem ``There'll be a slight delay, we'll be a *little* late, if you could be a *little* *patient*! We're just trying to get one of those *little* trucks to pull us up just a *little* closer to the jetway so you can walk down the narrow hallway and there'll be a man there in a tight suit and he'll tell you you have very little time to make your connecting flight. So move it!''.",52
36050,ELAINE," Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...",52
36051,JERRY," Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?",52
36052,ELAINE, Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.,52
36053,JERRY, I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works,52
36054,ELAINE, Gimme ten bucks and find out...,52
36055,JERRY," So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...",52
36056,ELAINE," Yeah, worked out good.",52
36057,JERRY, And here's the beauty--,52
36058,ELAINE, What?,52
36059,JERRY, George is pickin' us up at the airport.,52
36060,ELAINE, Get out of here! Why?,52
36061,JERRY, You know that awning outside my building?,52
36062,ELAINE, Yeah...,52
36063,JERRY," He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.",52
36064,ELAINE, So what happened?,52
36065,JERRY," He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.",52
36066,ELAINE," Hey, how we doin' on time?",52
36067,JERRY," Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...",52
36068,ELAINE, Hey! Wait up!,52
36069,JERRY, Hey! Wait up!,52
36070,DRIVER, Sorry. Heh heh heh...,52
36071,SKYCAP, Where you goin'?,52
36072,JERRY," Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?",52
36073,ELAINE," Yeah, you want five?",52
36074,JERRY, Gimme ten.,52
36075,ELAINE, You're giving him *ten* dollars?,52
36076,JERRY," Well, we got three bags.",52
36077,ELAINE, That's a pretty big tip...,52
36078,JERRY, That's what they get!,52
36079,ELAINE, They don't get that much.,52
36080,JERRY, Let's ask him.,52
36081,ELAINE, We can't ask him...,52
36082,JERRY, Let's see what he says.,52
36083,ELAINE," Jerry, we don't have time for this...",52
36084,JERRY," Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.",52
36085,SKYCAP," Depends on the person, depends on the bag.",52
36086,JERRY," Uh, how about a couple of people like us.",52
36087,SKYCAP," People like you? I wouldn't expect much, you don't even look like you know what you're doing...",52
36088,JERRY," C'mon, seriously...",52
36089,SKYCAP," Well, since you asked, usually, I get five dollars a bag.",52
36090,ELAINE, What!?,52
36091,SKYCAP, That's right.,52
36092,ELAINE, *Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.,52
36093,SKYCAP," Look, you asked, I told you.",52
36094,ELAINE, You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...,52
36095,JERRY," All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...",52
36096,ELAINE, You're lucky I don't report you...,52
36097,SKYCAP, JFK...,52
36098,SKYCAP, ...Honolulu.,52
36099,ELAINE, Wait up!,52
36100,JERRY," You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!",52
36101,TICKET LADY," Everything into JFK's booked... No, wait-- I have two seats into Laguardia-- but they're not together. It's boarding right now.",52
36102,JERRY, We'll take 'em!,52
36103,ELAINE, We're not going to sit together?,52
36104,JERRY," Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.",52
36105,ELAINE," Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.",52
36106,JERRY, We'll call him...,52
36107,ELAINE, There's no time.,52
36108,JERRY, No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?,52
36109,TICKET LADY, There's no time.,52
36110,JERRY," There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.",52
36111,TICKET LADY," I have one seat in first class, and one in coach. The price is the same since your flight was canceled.",52
36112,JERRY, I'll take the first class.,52
36113,ELAINE, Jerry!,52
36114,JERRY, What?,52
36115,ELAINE, Why should you get the first class?,52
36116,JERRY," Elaine, have you ever flown first class?",52
36117,ELAINE, No.,52
36118,JERRY," All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...",52
36119,ELAINE, You flew here coach.,52
36120,JERRY," Yeah, that's a point...",52
36121,ELAINE," All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.",52
36122,JERRY," Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.",52
36123,JERRY," Bon voyage, Lainey!",52
36124,ELAINE, Great... [To herself] Help me...,52
36125,TIA," Excuse me, I think you're in my seat...",52
36126,JERRY," Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!",52
36127,GEORGE," Hey, thanks for coming with me.",52
36128,KRAMER," Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?",52
36129,GEORGE, I confused it with another awning.,52
36130,KRAMER, So how we doin' on time?,52
36131,GEORGE," We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup.  What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!",52
36132,KRAMER, Will you relax?!,52
36133,GEORGE," Oh, I had it perfectly timed out",52
36134,KRAMER, This is the best way to go!,52
36135,GEORGE, Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...,52
36136,KRAMER," George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...",52
36137,GEORGE, Really?,52
36138,KRAMER," If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.",52
36139,GEORGE, The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?,52
36140,KRAMER, Duty.,52
36141,GEORGE," Yeah, ""duty"". Do you know how much duty is?",52
36142,KRAMER," No, I dunno how much duty is.",52
36143,GEORGE, Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...,52
36144,KRAMER, I still like to stop at the duty free shop.,52
36145,GEORGE, I like to stop at the duty free shop.,52
36146,TIA," So, he says, ``squeeze your breasts together'', and I say, ``I thought this was an ad for shoes''...",52
36147,JERRY, Oh my...,52
36148,TIA, Is that the new Esquire? Turn to page 146.,52
36149,JERRY, Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?,52
36150,TIA," See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background, out of focus?",52
36151,JERRY, Uh-huh...,52
36152,KRAMER, How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...,52
36153,ELAINE," Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.",52
36154,GEORGE, They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!,52
36155,KRAMER, Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!,52
36156,GEORGE," Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.",52
36157,KRAMER," No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.",52
36158,GEORGE, Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!,52
36159,KRAMER," Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.",52
36160,GROSSBARD," Oh, there it is honey, gate 18A, 8",52
36161,KRAMER, Did you see that guy?,52
36162,GEORGE, No... What guy?,52
36163,KRAMER, That guy.. He was just...,52
36164,GEORGE," Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!",52
36165,KRAMER, [still lost] I know that guy...,52
36166,PRISONER, Gotta get my Time magazine... Never miss my Time magazine.,52
36167,GUARD," Yeah, get your magazine and let's get out of here.",52
36168,PRISONER," Hey, I was gonna take that!",52
36169,GEORGE," Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first.",52
36170,PRISONER," I don't care when you got here, I want the magazine...",52
36171,GEORGE," You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!",52
36172,PRISONER," A *blurb*?!? *You're* a blurb! Check out the cover, idiot!",52
36173,GUARD," All right, let's go...",52
36174,PRISONER, I want the magazine!,52
36175,GEORGE, Umm... No.,52
36176,PRISONER," You know what I would do to you, if I wasn't in these shackles...",52
36177,GEORGE," But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!",52
36178,KRAMER," They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.",52
36179,GEORGE," Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...",52
36180,KRAMER, Where do I know that guy from?,52
36181,ELAINE," [To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...",52
36182,JERRY, Oh my... that *is* refreshing...,52
36183,ATTENDANT, Would you care for some slippers?,52
36184,JERRY," Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?",52
36185,TIA, Please!,52
36186,JERRY," Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.",52
36187,GEORGE, My name is not mentioned in this blurb...,52
36188,KRAMER, It's Grossbard!,52
36189,GEORGE, Who's Grossbard?,52
36190,KRAMER," When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!",52
36191,GEORGE," Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...",52
36192,KRAMER," No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...",52
36193,GEORGE," No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.",52
36194,JERRY," Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.",52
36195,ATTENDANT," They're gardenias, mostly.",52
36196,JERRY, I thought I smelled lilac.,52
36197,ATTENDANT," Yes, there are a few of those, too...",52
36198,TIA, It's almost overwhelming...,52
36199,CAPTAIN," Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Due to equipment problems at the runway at Laguardia, we've been instructed by the tower to re-route and land at JFK. We apologize for any inconvenience...",52
36200,ELAINE, [To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?,52
36201,GEORGE," Well, You're not gonna believe it...",52
36202,KRAMER, What?,52
36203,GEORGE, The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.,52
36204,KRAMER," Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.",52
36205,ATTENDANT," We have some *delicious* Chateau Briande, my personal favourite. Or, if you prefer something lighter, a poached Dover sole in a delicate white wine sauce with just a *hint* of saffron.",52
36206,JERRY," Oh, saffron! That sounds good.",52
36207,ATTENDANT, And today we're featuring wines from the *Tuscany* region...,52
36208,ELAINE, Hi. Can I get to my seat?,52
36209,ATTENDANT, You're just gonna have to wait...,52
36210,ELAINE, But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...,52
36211,ATTENDANT, You're not supposed to get up during the food service.,52
36212,ELAINE," Well, nobody *told* me that!",52
36213,ATTENDANT, Look. This plane is *full*. I got a lot of people to serve. Now please... You're just gonna have to wait.,52
36214,GEORGE, There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.,52
36215,KRAMER, Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!,52
36216,GEORGE, How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.,52
36217,KRAMER, Gimme your credit card.,52
36218,GEORGE, My credit card?,52
36219,KRAMER," Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.",52
36220,GEORGE, I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!,52
36221,KRAMER, I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.,52
36222,GEORGE," What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.",52
36223,KRAMER," No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.",52
36224,GEORGE, This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.,52
36225,ELAINE," Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...",52
36226,ELAINE, I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?,52
36227,ELAINE," Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.",52
36228,ATTENDANT, Are you sure?,52
36229,ELAINE," Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.",52
36230,ATTENDANT," Would you? Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal.",52
36231,ELAINE, Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.,52
36232,ELAINE, Then why didn't you take it?,52
36233,ELAINE, You're eating my food!,52
36234,ATTENDANT," Look, I got earplugs to collect. Do you want it, or not.",52
36235,TIA, This is the best sundae I've ever had.,52
36236,JERRY," Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.",52
36237,TIA, I've never met a man who knew so much about nothing.,52
36238,JERRY, Thank you...,52
36239,ATTENDANT, More anything?,52
36240,JERRY, More everything!,52
36241,KRAMER," Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon.",52
36242,GEORGE, Super Savers? Are they refundable!?,52
36243,GEORGE," You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!",52
36244,KRAMER, She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.,52
36245,GEORGE, Do you know how much this is going to cost me?,52
36246,KRAMER," Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you",52
36247,GEORGE," Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...",52
36248,ATTENDANT, Excuse me... Excuuuse me...,52
36249,ELAINE," What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks.",52
36250,ATTENDANT, What is your name?,52
36251,ELAINE, Elaine Benes?,52
36252,ATTENDANT, [Checks her list] You're going to have to go back to coach.,52
36253,ELAINE," No, but there was nobody sitting here...",52
36254,ATTENDANT," Yes, but you're still not allowed. These seats are very expensive.",52
36255,ELAINE," Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!",52
36256,ATTENDANT, You're going to have to go back to your seat!,52
36257,ELAINE," Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!",52
36258,JERRY," What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?",52
36259,ATTENDANT," Sir, this woman tried to *sneak* into first class.",52
36260,JERRY," Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.",52
36261,KRAMER, Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!,52
36262,JERRY, Couldn't be...,52
36263,JERRY," Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.",52
36264,ELAINE," Yeah, *you* got *your* bags...",52
36265,ELAINE, The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.,52
36266,JERRY," Yeah, me too...",52
36267,TIA, I'll call you.,52
36268,JERRY, Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...,52
36269,KRAMER, You guys ready?,52
36270,JERRY, Yeah. Where's George?,52
36271,GEORGE,  Kramer!,52
36272,GEORGE," I loved her Jerry, I loved her.",53
36273,JERRY," No, you didn't.",53
36274,GEORGE," And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.",53
36275,JERRY, No she didn't.,53
36276,GEORGE," What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?",53
36277,ELAINE," [OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.",53
36278,GEORGE, Who says?,53
36279,ELAINE, You did.,53
36280,GEORGE," Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.",53
36281,JERRY, You walk around with no underwear?,53
36282,GEORGE," Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?",53
36283,JERRY, I do a wash.,53
36284,GEORGE," Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.",53
36285,JERRY, When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.,53
36286,GEORGE, I loved her!,53
36287,JERRY, You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.,53
36288,GEORGE, I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.,53
36289,GEORGE, I gotta call her. Should I call her?,53
36290,JERRY," George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?",53
36291,GEORGE, Whyie?,53
36292,JERRY, You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.,53
36293,GEORGE, I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.,53
36294,JERRY," No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.",53

36310,KRAMER," Hey, you got any Double Crunch?",53
36311,JERRY, Yeah.,53
36312,JERRY," Kramer, should I call Susan?",53
36313,KRAMER, Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.,53
36314,GEORGE, My little man doesn't know.,53
36315,KRAMER, The little man knows all.,53
36316,GEORGE, My little man's an idiot.,53
36317,ELAINE," See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.",53
36318,KRAMER, You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...,53
36319,GEORGE, She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.,53
36320,ELAINE," No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.",53
36321,KRAMER," No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.",53
36322,GEORGE, She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.,53
36323,KRAMER," All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.",53
36324,ELAINE, Really? Can you really take a picture?,53

36326,ELAINE," All right, ha ha",53
36327,KRAMER, I don't know about that outfit though.,53
36328,ELAINE, Why? What's wrong with it?,53
36329,KRAMER," Well, we'll have to improvise.",53
36330,GEORGE,"  Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...",53
36331,JERRY, George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.													 ,53
36332,JERRY," So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.",53
36333,TIA, Are you sure you're ready for that kind of comitment?,53
36334,JERRY," Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.",53
36335,TIA, That's horrible!,53
36336,JERRY, What's that perfume you're wearing?,53

36342,JERRY, Oh my God is that the new perfume?,53
36343,TIA, Yeah.,53
36344,JERRY, I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.,53
36345,TIA, Are you sure?,53
36346,JERRY, And you're the model for this perfume?,53
36347,JERRY," Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]",53

36375,TIA, It's Ocean by CALVIN KLEIN.,53
36376,KRAMER," CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.",53
36377,JERRY, I know look at this [shows ad],53
36378,KRAMER," Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.",53

36380,GEORGE," Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?",53
36381,DANA," So uh, she broke up with you? ...",53
36382,GEORGE," Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?",53
36383,DANA," It's all right don't worry about it. So, why did she break up with you?",53
36384,GEORGE, What is with this damn zipper?,53
36385,DANA, It doesn't matter. You'll fix it later. Tell me about your girlfriend.,53
36386,GEORGE, It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.,53
36387,DANA," It doesn't matter, so ...",53
36388,GEORGE," This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...",53
36389,DANA," George, George, look at me. Okay, forget about the zipper. ... What's your girlfriend's name?",53
36390,GEORGE, ... Susan.,53
36391,DANA," Okay, we're getting somewhere.",53
36392,GEORGE," UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.",53
36393,ELAINE, Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.,53
36394,JERRY," Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. . A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.",53
36395,ELAINE, It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.,53
36396,JERRY, I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?,53
36397,ELAINE," Well, you know. It's a picture?",53
36398,JERRY, Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.,53
36399,ELAINE," Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?",53
36400,JERRY, ... um ...,53
36401,ELAINE, What?,53
36402,JERRY, Did you look at look at this picture carefully?,53
36403,ELAINE, Carefully?,53
36404,JERRY, Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.,53
36405,ELAINE, What?,53
36406,JERRY," Here. Take a look. What, what is that?",53
36407,ELAINE,  Oh my God! That's my nipple.,53
36408,JERRY, That's what I thought.,53
36409,ELAINE," That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.",53
36410,JERRY, DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?,53
36411,ELAINE," Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.",53
36412,KRAMER, Hey!,53
36413,ELAINE, Have you seen the card?,53
36414,KRAMER, What card?,53
36415,ELAINE, This car.,53
36416,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it.",53
36417,ELAINE, Well did you notice anything unusual about it?,53
36418,KRAMER, No.,53
36419,ELAINE, Well come here and take a look.,53
36420,KRAMER," Yeah, so?",53
36421,ELAINE," So, what's that?",53
36422,KRAMER, That's a nipple.,53
36423,ELAINE, Right!!,53
36424,KRAMER, Ooo!,53
36425,ELAINE," Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?",53
36426,KRAMER," Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,",53
36427,ELAINE, It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.,53
36428,JERRY," Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.",53
36429,ELAINE, No. I don't want him looking.,53
36430,JERRY, Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.,53
36431,ELAINE, Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.,53
36432,NEWMAN, Okay. What is it?,53
36433,JERRY, Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.,53
36434,NEWMAN, Your nipple's showing.,53
36435,JERRY, Okay. Thanks.,53
36436,NEWMAN, Anything else?,53
36437,JERRY, No.,53
36438,NEWMAN, All right. See you later.,53
36439,JERRY, What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.,53
36440,KRAMER, I got them too.,53
36441,JERRY, Everybody's got them.,53
36442,DANA, You see it's kind of got a little piece of cloth that's slipped underneath and it's ...,53
36443,GEORGE, Pull it up a little bit.,53
36444,DANA," Uhg. Well you hold it. Wait, uh, Damn It! I can't move it. God, I've never seen a zipper so stubborn. DAMN IT! I almost had it.",53
36445,GEORGE," Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate.",53
36446,DANA, No. Let me try...,53
36447,GEORGE, Take it right off the chest...,53
36448,DANA," Ugh, ..",53
36449,GEORGE, You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.,53
36450,DANA, YEAH!! UGH!!! ARG!!! ... I am afraid we're going to have to stop.,53
36451,GEORGE," Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?",53
36452,DANA, Yeah.,53
36453,GEORGE, ,53
36454,JERRY," No, No, No, No, Oh, No.",53
36455,JERRY, Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.,53
36456,GEORGE, Was it a scratch or a pick?,53
36457,JERRY, It was a scratch.,53
36458,GEORGE, Hey. It's me.,53
36459,JERRY, Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?,53
36460,JERRY, Yeah?,53
36461,ELAINE,  It's me.,53
36462,JERRY, Come on up.,53
36463,GEORGE, Was there any nostril penetration?,53
36464,JERRY, There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.,53
36465,GEORGE," So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?",53
36466,JERRY, Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?,53
36467,GEORGE, I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.,53
36468,JERRY," Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?",53
36469,GEORGE, No. That's disgusting!,53
36470,ELAINE," You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!",53
36471,GEORGE," Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.",53
36472,ELAINE, You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.,53
36473,KRAMER, Got any Double Crunch?,53
36474,JERRY, yeah. I think I do.,53
36475,KRAMER, What's that perfume?,53
36476,ELAINE," What, Ocean.",53
36477,KRAMER, That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.,53
36478,JERRY, I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.,53
36479,KRAMER, I thought you said it was a scratch.,53
36480,JERRY, But that's not what she thinks.,53
36481,GEORGE, Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.,53
36482,JERRY," All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.",53
36483,KRAMER, Let's go.,53
36484,GEORGE, It'll be different this time.,53
36485,SUSAN, I need someone a little more stable.,53
36486,GEORGE," I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!",53
36487,SUSAN, People don't change.,53
36488,GEORGE, I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.,53
36489,SUSAN, I'm not a soft boiled egg.,53
36490,GEORGE, And I am not a piece of toast.,53
36491,SUSAN, I just don't think we have anything in common.,53
36492,GEORGE," That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.",53
36493,SUSAN, Why were there so many cockroaches?,53
36494,GEORGE, Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins],53
36495,SUSAN, And they got along?,53
36496,GEORGE, Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!,53
36497,KRAMER, I want to talk to Calvin.,53
36498,SECRETARY, You can't go in there.,53
36499,KRAMER, Let me talk to Calvin.,53
36500,TIA, Kramer?,53
36501,KRAMER," Yeah, uh.",53
36502,CALVIN KLEIN, Who are you?,53
36503,KRAMER, I'm here to talk about the ocean.,53
36504,CALVIN KLEIN," Oh, yes kramer. I uh, think I know something about this. Will you excuse us Tia? [Tia leaves]",53
36505,KRAMER, Now I don't want any trouble Calvin.,53
36506,CALVIN KLEIN, Neither do I.,53
36507,JERRY, Hello there you are.,53
36508,TIA, What are you doing here?,53
36509,JERRY," Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.",53
36510,TIA," Well, I've been busy.",53
36511,JERRY," Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me ",53
36512,TIA,  I'd rather not talk about this..,53
36513,JERRY, But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.,53
36514,TIA, I know what I saw. ,53
36515,JERRY, But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!,53
36516,TIA, I gotta go. ,53
36517,JERRY, No! No pick!,53
36518,KRAMER," All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..",53
36519,KLEIN,  Interesting face..,53
36520,KRAMER," Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.",53
36521,KLEIN," You're very lithe, aren't you? Very graceful.",53
36522,KRAMER," Well, yeah.",53
36523,KLEIN," Sit down, eh?  You're very lean, but muscular..",53
36524,KRAMER," You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.",53
36525,KLEIN, You're spectacular.,53
36526,KRAMER,  Oh?,53
36527,ELAINE," I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.",53
36528,FRED,  Soo - what happened?!,53
36529,ELAINE," Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.",53
36530,FRED, I really don't see how you could miss a button like that.,53
36531,ELAINE," Oh, you've never missed a button?!  Yeah?..",53
36532,RECEPTIONIST," Your sister, Gail.",53
36533,ELAINE," Oh, God - my nephew.  Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.",53
36534,ELAINE," Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me ""Nip""!  It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.",53
36535,WOMAN," About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point?  My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!",53
36536,KLEIN, His buttocks are sublime!,53
36537,MAN," Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room.",53
36538,WOMAN,"  No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.",53
36539,MAN," You've done it again, C.K.!",53
36540,JERRY," An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught.  Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you..  Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?!  I am not an animal!",53
36541,ELAINE," I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had!  Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!",53
36542,GX, So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew I made a terrible mistake. Going back with her. So we're in her apartment she goes into the bathroom. I'm cursing myself; now how do I get out of this? Then it hits me like a bolt of lightening. The pick.,53
36543,JERRY, The pick?,53
36544,ELAINE, The pick?,53
36545,GEORGE," She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.",53
36546,JERRY, I think I've seen that look.,53
36547,KRAMER, I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.,53
36548,JERRY," Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.",53
36549,GEORGE, Your buttocks are spectacular.,53
36550,ELAINE, Oh my!,53
36551,KRAMER, What?,53
36552,ELAINE, I'm not sure but... I think I see your...,53
36553,JERRY, You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 9,54
36554,KERNIS," I hear you, guy.",54
36555,JERRY," And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!												% In the background is the plot complication of the week",54
36556,KERNIS, Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spot?,54
36557,JERRY," No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 10",54
36558,BUCKLES," Hey, Jer!",54
36559,JERRY," [not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]												% At the Paragon Theater, George joins the end of a queue. He taps the shoulder of the man in front of him.",54
36560,GEORGE," Excuse me, do you have a ticket?",54
36561,MAN, No.,54
36562,GEORGE, Okay. Good.												% Misunderstanding number one,54
36563,BUCKLES, Jerry!,54
36564,JERRY, What are <you> doing here?,54
36565,BUCKLES," Hey, do you think this is funny? ``Why do they call it athlete's foot? You don't have to be an athlete to get it. I mean, my father gets it all the time, and believe me, he's no athlete!''												% And you're no Jack Kennedy. Jerry is understandably unimpressed. He tries to escape, but Buckles won't let him. Jerry is on his way to the theater to tell his friends he can't make it, then back to the Improv. Buckles offers to join him and split the fare. ``I've got time! It'll give us a chance to know each other a little better!'' Elaine joins George in the queue.",54
36566,ELAINE, I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''.,54
36567,GEORGE," Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.",54
36568,ELAINE," ``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!",54
36569,GEORGE, ``Ponce de Leon''? But that was great!,54
36570,ELAINE," Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!",54
36571,GEORGE," Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.												% Apparently, a movie that can be interpreted on two levels. Misunderstanding number two",54
36572,KRAMER," Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.",54
36573,GEORGE, You're not going to get back here in time!,54
36574,KRAMER," I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!",54
36575,ELAINE, You can get a hot dog in the theater.,54
36576,KRAMER, I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!,54
36577,ELAINE," Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.",54
36578,KRAMER," Well, just save me a seat.												% This touches a raw nerve.",54
36579,ELAINE," No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!												% Kramer just asks for his ticket, but George doesn't have them.",54
36580,GEORGE, I'm in line to buy.,54
36581,ELAINE," No, George, this is the ticket-<holders> line.",54
36582,GEORGE," No it's not, it's the ticket-<buyers> line.",54
36583,ELAINE, Then how come we're not moving?,54
36584,KRAMER, Good question.												% George addresses the man in front of him.,54
36585,GEORGE," Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?												% George gloats, knowing what the answer is going to be.",54
36586,MAN, Holders.												% Instant double-take.,54
36587,GEORGE," But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!",54
36588,MAN, I didn't. My friend was getting it.,54
36589,GEORGE," [furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.												% Misunderstanding number three. George goes to get tickets, leaving Elaine and Kramer to talk behind his back.",54
36590,ELAINE, Can you believe him?,54
36591,KRAMER," He's spaced out.												% Let him who is without sin, Kramer.",54
36592,ELAINE, How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?,54
36593,KRAMER, [thinks for a while],54
36594,ELAINE," [gives up] Yeah, exactly...												% The movie has sold out. ``Real good, George. Real good.'' It's now 10",54
36595,ELAINE, I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!,54
36596,GEORGE, It's the same movie! What's the difference?,54
36597,ELAINE," It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.												% But she gives in. New plan. George and Elaine will get tickets at the Paradise, while Kramer waits at the Paragon to tell Jerry of the change in plans. But Kramer can't keep his eye off the Papaya King sign, flashing, beckoning, practically begging... Jerry suffers through Buckles' telling of his life story in the taxi.",54
36598,JERRY, [to taxi driver] Take the Park!,54
36599,BUCKLES," No no no, take 55th.												% Jerry can't stand it. Buckles somehow drifted onto the subject of fish and how much he hates it.",54
36600,BUCKLES," Jerry, I want you to do me a favor. No more fish!",54
36601,JERRY," [rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!",54
36602,BUCKLES," I had a point?												% At the Paradise, George succeeds in obtaining the tickets, and he joins Elaine in the ticket-holders line. ",54
36603,GEORGE," Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.",54
36604,ELAINE, Sigh/Ugh.,54
36605,GEORGE, I wouldn't mind seein' <that>.,54
36606,ELAINE," Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.",54
36607,GEORGE," So what's your point?												% Yeah, what's your point?",54
36608,GEORGE," By the way, you owe me seven fifty.",54
36609,ELAINE," Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?",54
36610,GEORGE," No, I don't have any change.",54
36611,ELAINE," Oh, well, then I'll pay you later.",54
36612,GEORGE," Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.",54
36613,ELAINE," Yeah, you *could*...",54
36614,GEORGE, Might be easier.,54
36615,ELAINE," I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.",54
36616,GEORGE," [trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.",54
36617,ELAINE, Yeah.,54
36618,GEORGE, So... Can I have it?,54
36619,ELAINE," I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.",54
36620,GEORGE," Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?",54
36621,ELAINE, I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.,54
36622,GEORGE," I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.",54
36623,ELAINE," [exasperated] George, you're sappin' my strength.												% The line begins to move. George offers to wait outside for K+J.",54
36624,GEORGE, You go in and save seats.,54
36625,ELAINE," [in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!												% With extreme reluctance, Elaine goes on ahead to save seats.												% The taxi is stuck in traffic. Jerry bawls out Buckles for choosing 55th on a Saturday night. Buckles considers how various famous people would react to be stuck in traffic, using Jerry as an unwilling guinea pig for his material.",54
36626,BUCKLES," Jerry, I want you to have this piece of material.",54
36627,JERRY," That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.",54
36628,BUCKLES, Jerry! Don't start up with me!,54
36629,JERRY, I gotta get out of this cab...,54
36630,BUCKLES," But Jerry, quit riffing!",54
36631,JERRY," No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?",54
36632,BUCKLES," [pause] Can you help me get on The Tonight Show?												% Apparently, not.",54
36633,ELAINE," No, these are saved.",54
36634,MAN," All of them? C'mon, you can't take *four* seats.",54
36635,ELAINE," What, is that a rule?												% George comes in; J+K haven't appeared. Elaine sends George to the Paragon to give Kramer his and Jerry's tickets. Throughout the conversation, Elaine fends off would-be claim-jumpers.",54
36636,GEORGE," Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.",54
36637,ELAINE," [stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.												% George returns to one of his favorite topics.",54
36638,GEORGE," Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.",54

36640,GEORGE," Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it.

36651,JERRY, Your trench coat in my closet?												% It's not like he's asking for a ride to the airport or anything.,54
36652,BUCKLES," Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills, I'm afraid to open the door. Just for a few months. It'll make all the difference in the world.												% Jerry sanely declines.

36663,KRAMER," No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.",54

36685,CLERK, Do you want the Medium size or the middle size?,54
36686,ELAINE, What's the difference?,54
36687,CLERK," Well, we have three sizes. Medium, Large, and Jumbo.",54
36688,ELAINE, [momentarily perplexed] What happened to the small?,54

36691,CLERK," Medium is Large, and large is Jumbo.",54

36693,CLERK, That's medium.,54
36694,ELAINE, Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?,54

36899,JERRY," Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?",55
36900,ELAINE, Yeah.,55
36901,JERRY," George, is this funny?",55
36902,GEORGE, It's funny!  and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.,55
36903,ELAINE, What? What did I do?,55
36904,GEORGE, Hi.,55
36905,JERRY,  Hello. Welcome back.,55
36906,CHERYL," Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about it.",55
36907,ELAINE," Well, nobody likes to get old, right?",55
36908,JERRY," Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.",55
36909,GEORGE," Funny guy, huh?",55
36910,ELAINE," Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.",55
36911,JERRY," Well thank you very much, it's about time.",55
36912,ELAINE," Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.",55
36913,JERRY," Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.",55
36914,ELAINE," Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.",55
36915,JERRY,"  Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.",55
36916,JERRY, Hear that? Guess who's back.  Hey!,55
36917,KRAMER, Hey.,55
36918,JERRY, I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.,55
36919,KRAMER," Well, the camp ended a few days early.",55
36920,JERRY, Why?,55
36921,KRAMER," Uh, well there was an incident.",55
36922,JERRY, What happened?,55
36923,KRAMER, I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.,55
36924,JERRY, What?,55
36925,KRAMER," Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.",55
36926,ELAINE, You punched who in the mouth?,55
36927,KRAMER, Mickey Mantle.,55
36928,JERRY, What happened?,55
36929,KRAMER," Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.",55
36930,JERRY, Wow! Joe Pepitone!,55
36931,KRAMER," Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.",55
36932,JERRY, You plunked him.,55
36933,KRAMER," Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.",55
36934,JERRY," Wow, this is incredible!",55
36935,BABU, Leave me alone! You can't do this to me!,55
36936,JERRY, What's going on out there?,55
36937,BABU," What are you doing? This is not right, people. You're making a very bad mistake, very bad.",55
36938,JERRY, Babu?  I'll be right back.,55
36939,ELAINE,"  Yeah, so?",55
36940,KRAMER," Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, ""Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!""",55
36941,ELAINE, So what'd you do?,55
36942,KRAMER," Well, I got the hell out of there.",55
36943,ELAINE, They took Babu away?!,55
36944,JERRY," Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.",55
36945,JERRY," I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!",55
36946,KRAMER," Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.",55
36947,JERRY,  Uh oh.,55
36948,ELAINE, What?,55
36949,JERRY, Well this is interesting.,55
36950,ELAINE, What is it?,55
36951,JERRY," It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.",55
36952,KRAMER," Well, doesn't he need that?",55
36953,JERRY," If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.",55
36954,ELAINE," Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.",55
36955,JERRY," Yeah, so am I being funny now?",55
36956,ELAINE," No, actually, you're not being funny now.",55
36957,JERRY," See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time.  Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.",55
36958,GEORGE," No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.",55
36959,JERRY," Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.",55
36960,GEORGE, What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.,55
36961,JERRY," Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.",55
36962,GEORGE," Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.",55
36963,JERRY," Ah, will you stop it already?",55
36964,GEORGE," Jerry, please?",55
36965,JERRY, How long is this gonna go on?,55
36966,GEORGE, Till I'm comfortable.,55
36967,JERRY," Well, when is that gonna be?",55
36968,GEORGE, After consummation.,55
36969,JERRY, Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.,55
36970,CHERYL, I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor. You're very lucky.,55
36971,JERRY,  That's wonderful news. Thank you.,55
36972,CHERYL," You're a very serious person, aren't you?",55
36973,JERRY," Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.",55
36974,CHERYL, I understand.,55
36975,CHERYL, I think it's curdled.,55
36976,JERRY, I don't care.,55
36977,CHERYL, Do you ever laugh?,55
36978,JERRY," Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.",55
36979,CHERYL, That's so sad. What do you do?,55
36980,JERRY," I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that.  You've been so helpful.",55
36981,ELAINE,"  Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?",55
36982,JERRY," Yeah, I'll just pay for this.",55
36983,ELAINE," Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl.  Hi.",55
36984,CHERYL, Hi.,55
36985,ELAINE," Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.",55
36986,CHERYL," Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through with it. But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose.",55
36987,JERRY, Babu!,55
36988,BABU," Jerry! Jerry, hello Jerry!",55
36989,JERRY, You remember Elaine.,55
36990,BABU," Yes, yes of course!",55
36991,ELAINE, Nice to meet you.,55
36992,BABU, So nice of you both to come.,55
36993,JERRY," Oh, Babu.",55
36994,BABU," No no, you're both very kind, very kind.",55
36995,ELAINE, We try.,55
36996,JERRY, We do what we can.,55
36997,ELAINE, We do what we can.,55
36998,BABU, The problem is I never got my Visa renewal form in the mail. I was expecting it.,55
36999,JERRY," Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.",55
37000,BABU, Comedy shows! You're a very funny man.,55
37001,JERRY," Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.",55
37002,BABU," Oh yes, of course. TV Guide, magazines, everything. You know, I would have picked up your mail, your box is right next to mine.",55
37003,JERRY," Oh, I don't want to bother you.",55
37004,BABU," No bother! You get me job, you get me apartment, you very very good man.",55
37005,JERRY," So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.",55
37006,BABU, Come again?,55
37007,JERRY," You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.",55
37008,ELAINE," Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.",55
37009,BABU, You had my Visa application?!,55
37010,JERRY, Well not technically.,55
37011,BABU,  I kill you!!,55
37012,JERRY, Well what about her?,55
37013,BABU, I kill both of you!!,55
37014,JERRY, Babu?!,55
37015,BABU, No Babu! No Babu! You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad man!,55
37016,JERRY," Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!",55
37017,BABU, The wheels are in motion?,55
37018,JERRY," The wheels are in motion, things are happening!",55
37019,GEORGE, Jerry?,55
37020,CHERYL, I'm very attracted to him.,55
37021,GEORGE," You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.",55
37022,CHERYL, He never said anything funny.,55
37023,GEORGE, He can't not be funny.,55
37024,CHERYL," No no no, he's dark. And disturbed.",55
37025,GEORGE," Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.",55
37026,CHERYL, So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?,55
37027,GEORGE," Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.",55
37028,CHERYL, I gotta go.,55
37029,GEORGE," Well, should I call you later?",55
37030,CHERYL, Please don't.,55
37031,GEORGE," But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!",55
37032,ELAINE," So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?",55
37033,JERRY," I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care													of it, he should be back by now.  Yeah?",55
37034,GEORGE, It's George.,55
37035,JERRY, C'mon up.,55
37036,JERRY, Babu must be back.,55
37037,JERRY, Where's Babu?,55
37038,JERRY, Who are you?,55
37039,JERRY, I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.,55
37040,ELAINE,  Snapple?,55
37041,JERRY," Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.",55
37042,GEORGE, She didn't help him?,55
37043,JERRY, No.,55
37044,GEORGE, Where is he?,55
37045,JERRY, He's in Pakistan.,55
37046,GEORGE, Oh boy.,55
37047,JERRY," What do you mean, oh boy?",55
37048,GEORGE," Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.",55
37049,JERRY," Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.",55
37050,GEORGE," What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.",55
37051,JERRY, That's because she had my mail.,55
37052,ELAINE," Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.",55
37053,KRAMER," Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.",55
37054,JERRY, How could you go in there?,55
37055,KRAMER," Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!",55
37056,JERRY," Well, what happened?",55
37057,KRAMER," I got down in my knees and went, ""Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!""",55
37058,ELAINE," So, what did he do?",55
37059,KRAMER," Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.",55
37060,VOICE, Kramer?,55
37061,KRAMER, Yeah? It's my Chinese food.,55
37062,ELAINE," Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.",55
37063,PING, Not anymore.,55
37064,ELAINE, What?,55
37065,PING," Cheryl call me last night, lawsuit back on.",55
37066,ELAINE, Why?,55
37067,PING," She call you and your friends big liars. You think she nice girl? Wait till you see her in court. She's a shark! They call her the Terminator. She never lose a case. Now you make her mad. She double the damages. Hasta la vista, baby.",55
37068,BABU," So his friend got the mail but she did not give it to him. And then he came to visit me. Said the lawyer was called to help, he said the wheels were in motion, but there was no motion. There was nothing. And so they sent me back here.",55
37069,BABU," I'm going to save up every rupee. Someday, I will get back to America, and when I do I will exact vengeance on this man. I cannot forget him. He haunts me. He is a very bad man. He is a very very bad man.",55
37070,GEORGE ," Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, ""I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!""",56
37071,JERRY ," That's funny, that's funny! ""I'm sick of cleaning."" That's very funny.",56
37072,GEORGE ," I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!",56
37073,JERRY," Yeah, it's funny!",56
37074,GEORGE," I mean, how funny is this?",56
37075,JERRY , It's funny.,56
37076,GEORGE," I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!",56
37077,JERRY," It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.",56
37078,GEORGE," Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.",56
37079,JERRY," Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.",56
37080,GEORGE," Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.",56
37081,JERRY," Right, right. Okay.  Elaine enters.",56
37082,GEORGE, Right,56
37083,JERRY,  What does she say...?,56
37084,GEORGE ," I don't know, what do women say?",56
37085,JERRY, I don't know.,56
37086,GEORGE, I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.,56
37087,JERRY," You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.",56
37088,GEORGE," Alright, forget Elaine.",56
37089,JERRY, Alright. ,56
37090,KRAMER, Hey.,56
37091,GEORGE, Hey.,56
37092,JERRY, Hey.,56
37093,KRAMER , You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.,56
37094,JERRY, Who?,56
37095,KRAMER, Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.,56
37096,JERRY, Did you talk to her?,56
37097,KRAMER," Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?",56
37098,JERRY, So what happened?,56
37099,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes,  ""Oh, hi! Kramer!"" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.",56
37100,JERRY," Yeah, I know about the three dates.",56
37101,KRAMER, You know what I did? I snubbed her.,56
37102,JERRY," What do you mean, you snubbed her?",56
37103,KRAMER, I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.,56
37104,JERRY , Right by her?,56
37105,KRAMER, Right by her!,56
37106,JERRY ," What you do say about a guy like this, huh!  You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her!  Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question.",56
37107,KRAMER," Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.",56
37108,ELAINE , I'm not even in here!,56
37109,JERRY," Yeah, I know.",56
37110,ELAINE," Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.",56
37111,JERRY," Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...",56
37112,ELAINE," You couldn't ""keep track"" of everybody?",56
37113,JERRY," Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh... ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.",56
37114,ELAINE, You have no idea?,56
37115,JERRY, Something derogatory? ,56
37116,GAIL , I thought I'd find you here.,56
37117,JERRY," Well, Gail Cunningham.",56
37118,ELAINE," Hi, Gail.",56
37119,GAIL," Hi, Elaine.  Hey, what is with your friend Kramer?",56
37120,JERRY, Why?,56
37121,GAIL, He snubbed me.,56
37122,JERRY, Are you sure?,56
37123,GAIL," Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?",56
37124,JERRY," Nothing.  Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. ",56
37125,ELAINE, I thought you were finished.,56
37126,JERRY," I took two bites, how am I finished?  Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick?  Bite?",56
37127,GAIL," So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?",56
37128,JERRY," I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.",56
37129,GAIL," Well, tell him that I am mad at him.",56
37130,JERRY," Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?",56
37131,GAIL, Pfeiffer's.,56
37132,JERRY," Ah, the power lunch crowd.",56
37133,GAIL , Nice shoes!,56
37134,ELAINE, Oh. Thank you.,56
37135,GAIL, Where'd you get 'em?,56
37136,ELAINE ," They're um, Botticelli's.",56
37137,GAIL ," Ooh, Botticelli's! Look at you! I'm afraid to go in there.",56
37138,ELAINE, Really.,56
37139,JERRY, Would you care to join us?,56
37140,GAIL," No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant.  Oh! See ya. ",56
37141,JERRY, See ya.,56
37142,ELAINE ," ""Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's.""",56
37143,JERRY, That bothered you?,56
37144,ELAINE," Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.",56
37145,JERRY, It did?,56
37146,ELAINE, Yes! Couldn't you see that?,56
37147,JERRY , No. This is why you're not in the pilot.,56
37148,DANA," Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on things. I think we're making progress.",56
37149,GEORGE," Yeah, I feel like I've grown.",56
37150,DANA," Good. So, let's pick up on this next week.",56
37151,GEORGE," Great.  Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?",56
37152,DANA," Yes, yes I did.",56
37153,GEORGE ," Well, what'd you think?",56
37154,DANA , Uh...it was...good.,56
37155,GEORGE, You didn't like it?,56
37156,DANA," Well, no, I -",56
37157,GEORGE, I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?,56
37158,DANA, It wasn't funny.,56
37159,GEORGE," It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?",56
37160,DANA," No, I didn't find it funny.",56
37161,GEORGE, You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?,56
37162,DANA," Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didn't really buy that.",56
37163,GEORGE," Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.",56
37164,DANA," George, if you're going to be in a creative field, you're going to have to learn how to deal with criticism.",56
37165,GEORGE," How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of ""com-med-dee""! You sitting here, telling people what to do.",56
37166,DANA, I think you'd better go.,56
37167,GEORGE," Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.'  It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!",56
37168,GEORGE ," So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script.  What kind of a therapist is that?",56
37169,ELAINE, I guess she didn't think it was funny.,56
37170,GEORGE," Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!",56
37171,JERRY, I thought your mother's paying for it.,56
37172,GEORGE," And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, ""Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person.""",56
37173,JERRY ," You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.",56
37174,ELAINE, What did I think of it? ,56
37175,KRAMER ," Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. ",56
37176,JERRY ," Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.",56
37177,ELAINE," Well, you know, I...",56
37178,KRAMER, I just kissed Gail Cunningham. ,56
37179,JERRY, You what?,56
37180,KRAMER," Yeah, I kissed her.",56
37181,JERRY, You kissed her?,56
37182,KRAMER, Right on the mouth.,56
37183,JERRY, What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?,56
37184,KRAMER," Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! ",56
37185,JERRY, And what did she do?,56
37186,KRAMER, She kissed me back.,56
37187,JERRY," I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?",56
37188,KRAMER ," Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!",56
37189,GEORGE," No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. ",56
37190,KRAMER ," Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.",56
37191,ELAINE, What? Who told you that?,56
37192,KRAMER, Gail Cunningham.,56
37193,ELAINE," I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?",56
37194,KRAMER," Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.",56
37195,ELAINE ," ""How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!"" Did you hear this? ",56
37196,JERRY, So what?,56
37197,ELAINE, So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! ,56
37198,ELAINE, Hey! Gail!,56
37199,GAIL, Ya.  Elaine...!,56
37200,ELAINE, Why are you talking about my shoes?,56
37201,GAIL, What?,56
37202,ELAINE, My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.,56
37203,GAIL, What are you talking about?,56
37204,ELAINE, Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? ,56
37205,WAITER, Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera?,56
37206,GAIL," Look Elaine, I am very busy here.",56
37207,ELAINE," Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!",56
37208,GAIL, I am not discussing this. This is insane.,56
37209,WAITER, You got that pasta primavera? Let's go!,56
37210,GAIL," Ya ya ya, here.",56
37211,WAITER," Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple.",56
37212,RUSSELL, Thank you.,56
37213,WAITER, Sorry for the delay. Enjoy your lunch.,56
37214,RUSSELL ," Well, come in. ",56
37215,RUSSELL," Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week.",56
37216,JERRY, Are you alright?,56
37217,RUSSELL," Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.",56
37218,JERRY," Oh, Where did you eat?",56
37219,RUSSELL, Pfeiffer's.,56
37220,JERRY, Ah. I know the chef there.,56
37221,RUSSELL, Yeah. The food's usually terrific.,56
37222,GEORGE, My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. ,56
37223,RUSSELL, What are you saying?,56
37224,GEORGE," Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.",56
37225,RUSSELL," Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon.",56
37226,JERRY," Oh, you have a daughter?",56
37227,RUSSELL," Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week.",56
37228,GEORGE," Aw, that's a fun age. ",56
37229,RUSSELL," Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...",56
37230,JERRY, What?,56
37231,RUSSELL, Excuse me for a second. ,56
37232,JERRY, What?,56
37233,GEORGE, Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...!   Do you think he liked it? ,56
37234,JERRY, I'm not sure.  What was that dish he said he had...?,56
37235,GEORGE, Pasta primavera.,56
37236,JERRY," Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'",56
37237,GEORGE, No!,56
37238,JERRY, Yeah.,56
37239,RUSSELL ," Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me.",56
37240,GEORGE," So, you were saying how, um...about the script...",56
37241,RUSSELL," Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...",56
37242,GEORGE, More jokes?,56
37243,JERRY, Another ending?,56
37244,GEORGE, A different name for the butler? ,56
37245,JERRY, Maybe we should go.,56
37246,GEORGE," We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. ",56
37247,RUSSELL , Oh God. Oh my god.,56
37248,JERRY," I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. ",56
37249,MOLLY, Hello.,56
37250,JERRY, Hi.,56
37251,GEORGE, Hi.,56
37252,MOLLY, I'm Molly.,56
37253,JERRY," Oh, I'm Jerry.",56
37254,GEORGE, George.,56
37255,JERRY, We're here discussing our script with your father.,56
37256,GEORGE, He just read it. ,56
37257,MOLLY, Daddy? Are you okay?,56
37258,RUSSELL ," Yeah, yeah sweetie. I'm fine. ",56
37259,GEORGE," So, you live with your mother, huh?",56
37260,MOLLY," Uh, yeah.",56
37261,GEORGE , Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.,56
37262,JERRY, Uh huh.,56
37263,GEORGE," Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. ",56
37264,MOLLY," Daddy, are you alright? What's the matter?",56
37265,RUSSELL, It's just a stomach thing.,56
37266,MOLLY, Yuck.,56
37267,RUSSELL ," We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. ",56
37268,GEORGE," You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. ",56
37269,RUSSELL ," Get a good look, Costanza?",56
37270,JERRY, What were you doing?,56
37271,GEORGE," Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!",56
37272,JERRY, You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.,56
37273,GEORGE," It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.",56
37274,JERRY," Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.",56
37275,GEORGE," All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.",56
37276,JERRY, That's why I poked.,56
37277,GEORGE, That's why I peeked. ,56
37278,GAIL, Hey! What is with your friend Elaine?,56
37279,JERRY, What?,56
37280,GAIL," She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes.",56
37281,JERRY, She did?,56
37282,KRAMER, Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.,56
37283,GAIL," So, I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her. ",56
37284,GEORGE, Pasta primavera?,56
37285,JERRY, Is that what she said? ,56
37286,KRAMER ," She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.",56
37287,JERRY, She is?,56
37288,KRAMER," She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. ",56
37289,JERRY," Hello? Oh, hi Stu.",56
37290,GEORGE , From NBC?,56
37291,JERRY,  Yeah.  What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks.  Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. ,56
37292,JERRY ," If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.",56
37293,ELAINE," Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!",56
37294,GEORGE, He poked me!,56
37295,JERRY," There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex -  - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...",56
37296,ELAINE, But she was fifteen.,56
37297,JERRY," You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.",56
37298,GEORGE," Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...",56
37299,JERRY," You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.",56
37300,GEORGE," Hey, now you're onto something.",56
37301,JERRY, The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.,56
37302,GEORGE," Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine.",56
37303,JERRY, No.,56
37304,GEORGE," But...somebody like Gail, though.",56
37305,JERRY, Ya.,56
37306,ELAINE," What? What do you mean, Gail? ",56
37307,KRAMER, Yah-hey.,56
37308,JERRY," Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.",56
37309,KRAMER," Alright, I'll call her right now.",56
37310,JERRY, Ok. ,56
37311,ELAINE ," What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?",56
37312,JERRY," Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... ",56
37313,KRAMER, She said she'll do it.,56
37314,GEORGE, Beautiful.,56
37315,JERRY, Beautiful.,56
37316,KRAMER , But she wants the shoes.,56
37317,ELAINE, What?,56
37318,KRAMER, She says she wants those shoes.,56
37319,ELAINE, She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!,56
37320,JERRY," No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!",56
37321,ELAINE," No, these were the last pair of these that they had!",56
37322,JERRY, I'll get you another one just like it!,56
37323,ELAINE," No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? ",56
37324,GEORGE ," Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...",56
37325,ELAINE," Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -",56
37326,GEORGE, Never mind!,56
37327,ELAINE," Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?",56
37328,KRAMER," Alright, what size are you?",56
37329,ELAINE, Seven-and-a-half.,56
37330,KRAMER, Eh! Bingo.,56
37331,GAIL ," Sauce this.  Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. ",56
37332,JERRY, Hey! Whattaya know!,56
37333,GEORGE, Look who's here!,56
37334,JERRY, Fancy meeting you here!,56
37335,RUSSELL, Oh. Hello.,56
37336,GEORGE , Pasta primavera! Back on the horse.,56
37337,JERRY," You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.",56
37338,GEORGE, Didn't hear anything...,56
37339,JERRY, Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.,56
37340,RUSSELL," Well, it just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now.  So, what were you saying?",56
37341,GEORGE," Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer.  Did I leer?",56
37342,JERRY, No leer. ,56
37343,ELAINE ," Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?",56
37344,RUSSELL ," Uh, no. ",56
37345,GEORGE," Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. ",56
37346,RUSSELL," Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together. ",56
37347,ELAINE," Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?",56
37348,RUSSELL , No.,56
37349,ELAINE , Do you have a...ketchup secret?,56
37350,RUSSELL," No, I... ...don't have a ketchup secret. ",56
37351,ELAINE ," Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. ",56
37352,RUSSELL ," Field of vision, huh?",56
37353,GAIL, How's everything?,56
37354,ELAINE, Mmmm.,56
37355,JERRY, Really good.,56
37356,GEORGE, This pasta primavera is fabulous.,56
37357,JERRY, Very tasty.,56
37358,GAIL, How'd everything go with that NBC guy?,56
37359,GEORGE, Great.,56
37360,JERRY," The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night.  Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?",56
37361,ELAINE," You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.",56
37362,JERRY," Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.",56
37363,ELAINE," Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.",56
37364,GEORGE," Well, it's a funny idea.",56
37365,JERRY, It's funny!,56
37366,GEORGE," C'mon, funny is funny.",56
37367,JERRY," Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?",56
37368,ELAINE," Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.",56
37369,JERRY, If you can.,56
37370,GEORGE," Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?",56
37371,ELAINE," Bouchard's, on 53rd. ",56
37372,JERRY," I think what he's trying to say is, ""get the bouilla-base."" ",56
37373,ALLISON, I don't want to *live*! I don't want to *live*!,57
37374,GEORGE, Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!,57
37375,ALLISON, No... You're *something*.,57
37376,GEORGE, You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!,57
37377,ALLISON, You're good. You're *good*!,57
37378,GEORGE, I'm bad. I'm *bad*!,57
37379,ALLISON, You're *killing* me!,57
37380,GEORGE, So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.,57
37381,ELAINE, Over you?,57
37382,GEORGE," Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?",57
37383,GEORGE," I got two tickets to see ""Guys And Dolls"".",57
37384,ELAINE, I got him a two-line phone.,57
37385,JERRY, Unbelievable! She's not there.,57
37386,GEORGE, What paper does she write for?,57
37387,JERRY," The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.",57
37388,ELAINE, Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...,57
37389,JERRY," Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...",57
37390,ELAINE, [Proudly] Really?,57
37391,ELAINE," Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?",57
37392,JERRY, Living or all time?,57
37393,ELAINE, All time.,57
37394,JERRY," Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.",57
37395,ELAINE, I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?,57
37396,GEORGE, Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.,57
37397,ELAINE, I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.,57
37398,ELAINE," Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.",57
37399,GEORGE," So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.",57
37400,JERRY, [indignantly] What's the matter with you?,57
37401,GEORGE," [quietly] C'mon, go along...",57
37402,JERRY, I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me,57
37403,JERRY, Y'know I hear that all the time.,57
37404,ELAINE, Hear what?,57
37405,JERRY, That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.,57
37406,ELAINE," Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.",57
37407,JERRY," Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.",57
37408,ELAINE, And you get along well with women.,57
37409,GEORGE, I guess that leaves me in the clear...													 													,57
37410,GEORGE," I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.",57
37411,JERRY," Oh yeah, what? ""Buck Naked""?",57
37412,GEORGE," Yeah, how did you know that?",57
37413,JERRY, You told me that already like two months ago.,57
37414,GEORGE, Allison bought it for me.,57
37415,JERRY, How you gonna get out of *that* one?,57
37416,GEORGE, I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.,57
37417,JERRY, He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?,57
37418,SHARON," Sure, I'd like to talk to him, too.",57
37419,GEORGE, Jerry did you wash this pear?,57
37420,JERRY," Yeah, I washed it.",57
37421,GEORGE, It looks like it hasn't been washed.,57
37422,JERRY, So *wash* *it*.,57
37423,GEORGE, You hear the way he talks to me?,57
37424,SHARON, You should hear how *my* boyfriend talks to me...,57
37425,GEORGE, Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?,57
37426,SHARON, It's nice.,57
37427,GEORGE, Jerry said he didn't like it.,57
37428,JERRY, I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...,57
37429,GEORGE," No, you said you didn't like it...",57
37430,JERRY," Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?",57
37431,SHARON, So how did you two meet?,57
37432,JERRY," Actually, we met in the gym locker room.",57
37433,GEORGE, Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.,57
37434,SHARON, Do you guys live together?,57
37435,JERRY, [quizzically] Live together?,57
37436,GEORGE," No, I got my own place.",57
37437,SHARON, And do your parents know?,57
37438,JERRY, Know *what*?,57
37439,GEORGE, My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...,57
37440,JERRY," Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!",57
37441,JERRY, There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...,57
37442,GEORGE," No, of course not...",57
37443,JERRY, I mean that's fine if that's who you are...,57
37444,GEORGE, Absolutely...,57
37445,JERRY, I mean I have many gay friends...,57
37446,GEORGE, My *father* is gay...,57
37447,SHARON," Look, I know what I heard.",57
37448,JERRY, It was a *joke*...,57
37449,GEORGE," Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!",57
37450,KRAMER," Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!",57
37451,GEORGE, No!,57
37452,JERRY, No steam!,57
37453,KRAMER, Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!,57
37454,KRAMER, Happy birthday paruba!,57
37455,JERRY, Today's not my birthday.,57
37456,KRAMER," Well, I beg to differ...",57
37457,JERRY, Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!,57
37458,JERRY," Hey, where you going?",57
37459,ELAINE, I gotta go return something...,57
37460,SHARON," Jerry, it's Sharon from NYU. I'm just calling to tell you that I'm not going to play up that angle we talked about and I'm sorry.",57
37461,JERRY," Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?",57
37462,GEORGE, Hey.,57
37463,JERRY," Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.",57
37464,GEORGE," So, what did she say?",57
37465,JERRY," She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...",57
37466,GEORGE, Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...,57
37467,JERRY, What are you talkin' about?,57
37468,GEORGE, I heard what you said,57
37469,JERRY," You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?",57
37470,GEORGE," Yes, I heard you!",57
37471,JERRY," Well, maybe she was disconnected.",57
37472,GEORGE, Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!,57
37473,JERRY," Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...",57
37474,KRAMER, Yello?,57
37475,JERRY," Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<",57
37476,GEORGE," ""There may be a problem with the phone, hold on""!",57
37477,JERRY," Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!",57
37478,GEORGE," ""The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye""!",57
37479,JERRY, Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?,57
37480,GEORGE," Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...",57
37481,JERRY," No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!",57
37482,SHARON, Why don't you take a seat?,57
37483,ELAINE, Thank-you.,57
37484,SHARON, Why don't you take your coat off?,57
37485,ELAINE," So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.",57
37486,JERRY," She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.",57
37487,GEORGE," Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!",57
37488,JERRY," So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...",57
37489,GEORGE, Not at all.,57
37490,GEORGE," Two tickets to ""Guys And Dolls""! I'm gonna go with you!",57
37491,JERRY," ""Guys And Dolls""? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?",57
37492,GEORGE," It's ""Guys And *Dolls*"", not ""Guys And *Guys*"".",57
37493,JERRY," ""The Collected Works Of Bette Midler"".",57
37494,JERRY, What do you got there?,57
37495,JERRY," ""Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..."" Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been ""outed""! I wasn't even ""in""!",57
37496,GEORGE, Now everyone's going to think we're gay!,57
37497,JERRY, Not that there's anything wrong with that...,57
37498,GEORGE," No, not at all...",57
37499,JERRY," ""Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--"" *I told you that pear was washed*!",57
37500,KRAMER, I thought we were friends...,57
37501,JERRY, Here we go...,57
37502,KRAMER," I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?",57
37503,JERRY, It's not true!,57
37504,KRAMER," Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...",57
37505,JERRY, So are you...,57
37506,KRAMER, Yeah--,57
37507,GEORGE, Hello?,57
37508,MRS. S, George?,57
37509,GEORGE, Mrs. Seinfeld?!?,57
37510,MRS. S," Oh, my God...",57
37511,JERRY," Oh, my God! [takes the phone] Ma?",57
37512,MRS. S, Jerry?,57
37513,JERRY, Ma!,57
37514,GEORGE," Oh, my God! My *MOTHER*!!!",57
37515,MRS. S, Jerry?,57
37516,JERRY," Ma, it's not true!",57
37517,MR. S, It's those damn culottes you made him wear when he was five!,57
37518,MRS. S," They weren't culottes, they were shorts.",57
37519,MR. S, They were culottes! You bought them in the girl's department.,57
37520,MRS. S," By mistake! By mistake, Jerry! I'm sorry!",57
37521,MR. S," It looked like he was wearing a skirt, for crying out loud!",57
37522,JERRY," Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!",57
37523,MRS. S," Not that there's anything wrong with that, Jerry.",57
37524,MRS. C," I open up the paper, and *this* is what I have to read about? I fell right off the toilet. My back went out again, I couldn't move... The super had to come and get help me up. I was half naked!",57
37525,GEORGE, It's *not* *true*!,57
37526,MRS. C, Every *day* it's something else with you. I don't know anything about you any more. Who are you? What kind of life are you leading? Who knows *what* you're doing? Maybe you're making porno films.,57
37527,GEORGE, Yeah. I'm Buck Naked.,57
37528,MRS. C," Jerry, I can see. He's so neat and thin. Not that there's anything wrong with it.",57
37529,GEORGE, Of course not...,57
37530,NURSE, 6,57
37531,GEORGE," Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?",57
37532,SAILOR," Excuse me, sir? I don't mean to bother you. I just wanted you to know that it took a lot of guts to come out the way you did, and that you've inspired me to do the same, even though that may mean a discharge from the service. Thanks.",57
37533,JERRY," Y'know, I think I'll pass on the ""Guys And Dolls""...",57
37534,GEORGE, No. Just imagine her reaction.,57
37535,ELAINE, Yeah...,57
37536,GEORGE," Oh, my God...",57
37537,JERRY, What?,57
37538,GEORGE," She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!",57
37539,ALLISON, Yeah? So?,57
37540,GEORGE, Yeah so??,57
37541,ALLISON, Well this is nice. They mention your name.,57
37542,GEORGE, Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?,57
37543,ALLISON," No, what?",57
37544,GEORGE," I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.",57
37545,ALLISON, You're *gay*?,57
37546,GEORGE, Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.,57
37547,ALLISON, [matter-of-factly] I don't believe it.,57
37548,GEORGE, You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.,57
37549,ALLISON, I will.,57
37550,GEORGE, What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.,57
37551,ALLISON, [Grabs George's lapels] I want to hear it from *Jerry*...,57
37552,SHARON," Oh, can you ever forgive me?",57
37553,JERRY," I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...",57
37554,SHARON," Y'know the funny thing is, I was attracted to you immediately.",57
37555,JERRY," I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.",57
37556,GEORGE," Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!",57
37557,JERRY, What!?,57
37558,GEORGE, You're with a *woman*!,57
37559,JERRY, I know! What are you doin' here?!?,57
37560,GEORGE," I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!",57
37561,JERRY, [forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!,57
37562,SHARON, What's going on?,57
37563,ALLISON," Yeah, what's going on?",57
37564,GEORGE," Alright, tell her. Go ahead.",57
37565,JERRY, Tell her what?,57
37566,GEORGE, Y'know. About *us*.,57
37567,GEORGE," Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.",57
37568,ALLISON, *Really*?,57
37569,KRAMER, We'll see you later...,57
37570,KRAMER, He's the *phone* man!,57
37571,KRAMER, Not that there's anything wrong with that...,57
37572,GEORGE," Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?",58
37573,JERRY," Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...",58
37574,GEORGE, Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.,58
37575,JERRY," Yeah, how about a mute?",58
37576,GEORGE, A mute would be good.,58
37577,JERRY," Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?",58
37578,GEORGE, This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.,58
37579,GEORGE," I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...",58
37580,JERRY," A deep, yawning chasm...",58
37581,GEORGE, There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?,58
37582,JERRY, Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.,58
37583,ELAINE, Hey boys!,58
37584,JERRY, Hey! How you doin'?,58
37585,ELAINE," Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.",58
37586,GEORGE, Start what?,58
37587,ELAINE, I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.,58
37588,GEORGE, *Really*.,58
37589,ELAINE," Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.",58
37590,GEORGE," Volunteer work, huh?",58
37591,JERRY, What're you gonna do down there?,58
37592,ELAINE," Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.",58
37593,JERRY, That's what I do with him [points at George],58
37594,GEORGE, When did you get this idea?,58
37595,ELAINE, Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.,58
37596,JERRY," What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?",58
37597,GEORGE, And... and anybody can do this?,58
37598,ELAINE, Yup.,58
37599,GEORGE," Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!",58
37600,ELAINE, [To Jerry] What about you?,58
37601,JERRY," Nah, it's not for me.",58
37602,ELAINE," Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.",58
37603,GEORGE, What *kind* of a person are you?,58
37604,JERRY, I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.,58
37605,AGENCY REP, This is a wonderful thing you're doing. They're so grateful just to have someone to talk to. And I can tell you that everyone who participates finds the experience extremely rewarding.,58
37606,GEORGE," Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.",58
37607,AGENCY REP, Good luck.,58
37608,JERRY, Thank you.,58
37609,GEORGE," Hey, what's your guy's name again?",58
37610,JERRY, Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?,58
37611,GEORGE, Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?,58
37612,JERRY, *We*? No.,58
37613,KRAMER," So what's up, Diggity Dog?",58
37614,JERRY, George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.,58
37615,KRAMER," Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.",58
37616,JERRY, What're you talkin' about?,58
37617,KRAMER," Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!",58
37618,JERRY, What?,58
37619,KRAMER," It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*.",58
37620,JERRY, Where do you *get* this?,58
37621,KRAMER," The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.",58
37622,NEWMAN, Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?,58
37623,KRAMER, I'm in here. C'mon...,58
37624,JERRY," Hello, *Newman*...",58
37625,NEWMAN," Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records?",58
37626,KRAMER, Well--,58
37627,JERRY, What records?,58
37628,KRAMER," Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.",58
37629,NEWMAN, You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!,58
37630,KRAMER," Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--",58
37631,KRAMER," Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.",58
37632,GEORGE," Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?",58
37633,NEWMAN, I'm a United States postal worker.,58
37634,GEORGE, Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?,58
37635,NEWMAN, Sometimes...,58
37636,JERRY, Why *is* that?,58
37637,NEWMAN," Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!",58
37638,RON, I'll give you five bucks.,58
37639,KRAMER, Five bucks???,58
37640,NEWMAN," Well, you know how much those records are worth!?",58
37641,RON," Yeah, I do... Fi' dollars.",58
37642,NEWMAN, Those records are worth more than five dollars!,58
37643,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] He's gyppin' us...,58
37644,NEWMAN, You're gyppin' us!,58
37645,RON," Well, whattya got here, y'know, you got ""Don Ho",58
37646,KRAMER," Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.",58
37647,NEWMAN, They follow him like a cult.,58
37648,KRAMER, He can't even walk down the street in South America...,58
37649,RON," Look, that's his problem, alright? Now you don't like it, too bad.",58
37650,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] I don't like it...,58
37651,NEWMAN, I don't like it.,58
37652,RON," Well, then get the Hell out of my store, alright? You bring me something decent, I'll give you some money.",58
37653,KRAMER," [In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack.",58
37654,NEWMAN," Alright, well be back... *jack*!",58
37655,JERRY," Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.",58
37656,HOUSEKEEPER, Agency?,58
37657,JERRY," Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?",58
37658,HOUSEKEEPER, Sid Fields.,58
37659,SID, What the *Hell* is it?,58
37660,JERRY, Mr. Fields?,58
37661,SID, What!?!,58
37662,JERRY," Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.",58
37663,SID, Agency? What agency? The *CIA*?,58
37664,JERRY," No, no, the--",58
37665,SID, Who let you in here?,58
37666,JERRY," The woman, she--",58
37667,SID," Oh *her*. She *steals* from me. Steals my money. She says she doesn't speak English. My *ass* she doesn't speak English. Plays that freakin' ""voo-doo"" music, tries to hypnotize me. She thinks she's gonna turn me into a zombie and then rob me blind. Well, I wasn't born yesterday. I may drop dead today, but I sure as Hell wasn't born yesterday. Now get the Hell out of my house...",58
37668,JERRY," Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.",58
37669,SID," Oh, really. Are you the boyfriend? I know she's got a boyfriend. Are you going to *kill* me? I'm an old man for crying out loud, you gonna kill an old man, you coward?!? [Jerry gets out card]",58
37670,JERRY," No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm--",58
37671,SID, I can't read that you fool...,58
37672,JERRY, What's all this stuff?,58
37673,SID, Trash. Garbage.,58
37674,JERRY, You're throwin' this out??,58
37675,SID," I believe that's what you do with garbage, you idiot.",58
37676,JERRY, You don't want any of this?,58
37677,SID," Well if I wanted it I wouldn't be throwing it away, *Ein-stein*.",58
37678,JERRY, You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.,58
37679,SID," Well, take it. I'm sure as Hell not going to give it to my family.",58
37680,JERRY," Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...",58
37681,SID, With you? I'd rather be dead.,58
37682,JERRY," Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.",58
37683,SID," Good. Thank God. Good riddance. [pause] Oh listen, before you go, would you mind changing my diaper? HAA!!",58
37684,BEN," No, I feel great for 85.",58
37685,GEORGE," Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.",58
37686,BEN, I'm not afraid of dyin'. I never think about it.,58
37687,GEORGE," You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...",58
37688,BEN, I'm grateful for every moment I have.,58
37689,GEORGE," Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...",58
37690,BEN, I guess I just don't care.,58
37691,GEORGE, What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!,58
37692,GEORGE," Wait a second, where are you going?",58
37693,BEN, Life's too short to waste on you.,58
37694,GEORGE," Wait a minute, please--",58
37695,BEN, Get out of my way...,58
37696,GEORGE," But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...",58
37697,ELAINE, Mrs. Oliver?,58
37698,MRS. O, Yes my dear.,58
37699,ELAINE, Ooh!,58
37700,MRS. O, What's the trouble? Are you alright?,58
37701,ELAINE, Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.,58
37702,MRS. O," It's my goiter, isn't it?",58
37703,ELAINE, Did you say goiter? What goiter?,58
37704,MRS. O, This football-shaped lump jutting out the side of my neck.,58
37705,ELAINE," Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...",58
37706,MRS. O, Does it bother you?,58
37707,ELAINE," Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.",58
37708,JERRY," C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter...",58
37709,ELAINE, I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there,58
37710,JERRY, They really should mention that in the breakdown,58
37711,ELAINE, Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.,58
37712,JERRY," Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.",58
37713,ELAINE," Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy?",58
37714,GEORGE, I don't think it's gonna work out...,58
37715,JERRY, Whattya mean?,58
37716,GEORGE, He fired me.,58
37717,JERRY, He fired you?!?,58
37718,ELAINE, *How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?,58
37719,GEORGE, I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!,58
37720,JERRY," Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.",58
37721,ELAINE, I wish I could quit...,58
37722,JERRY, So quit!,58
37723,GEORGE," Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.",58
37724,KRAMER," Well, here's your *albums* [Journey ""Escape"" is on top, BTW...]",58
37725,JERRY, What happened?,58

37727,KRAMER," Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store.",58
37728,NEWMAN, That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.,58
37729,JERRY," Oh yeah, you and your *Sergio Mendes*...",58
37730,KRAMER," Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!",58
37731,JERRY, Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away,58
37732,KRAMER," Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??",58
37733,JERRY," Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.",58
37734,KRAMER, Okay...,58
37735,NEWMAN, [In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!,58
37736,KRAMER, Yeah...,58
37737,JERRY, But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.,58
37738,KRAMER," Yeah, but you've gotta come with us.",58
37739,JERRY," Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...",58
37740,GEORGE, Senegal?,58
37741,GEORGE, So you don't speak *any* English at all?,58
37742,HOUSEKEEPER, English? No.,58
37743,SID," Hey, what are those bums doin' back there?",58
37744,JERRY, Well you said they could come and take the records.,58
37745,SID, It's like watchin' a couple of hyenas goin' through the garbage.,58
37746,GEORGE, You don't speak *any* English?,58
37747,HOUSEKEEPER, No English.,58
37748,GEORGE, I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!,58
37749,JERRY, So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--,58
37750,SID," Hey, I don't like what's goin' on around here. I want all you bums outta here.",58
37751,KRAMER," Now calm down, Mr. Fields...",58
37752,SID, Now don't tell me to calm down... Get your hands off of me! Why you little...,58
37753,KRAMER, Oooow! He's biting me!,58
37754,SID, My teeth! My teeth!,58
37755,JERRY, Where's his teeth! Where's his teeth!,58
37756,GEORGE, I thought I saw something fly over here...,58
37757,JERRY, Well turn the light on...,58
37758,JERRY, That's the garbage disposal!,58
37759,SID, My teeth! You idiots!!!,58
37760,MRS. O, And we would take long automobile trips--,58
37761,ELAINE," Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...",58
37762,MRS. O, Staring out the window--,58
37763,ELAINE, Uh huh...,58
37764,MRS. O, You'd see a long view of rolling pastures and--,58
37765,ELAINE," Well, that'll get you goin' right there...",58
37766,MRS. O," Big, roaming cows--",58
37767,ELAINE," Cows, well that's fascinating...",58
37768,MRS. O, That's when I began my affair with Mohandas.,58
37769,ELAINE, What?,58
37770,MRS. O, Mohandas.,58
37771,ELAINE, Ghandhi?,58
37772,MRS. O," Oh, the *passion*. The *forbidden pleasure*--",58
37773,ELAINE, You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O,58
37774,ELAINE," Oh, my God... The Mohatma?",58
37775,RON, Twenty bucks.,58
37776,NEWMAN, Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?,58
37777,RON," Well, take it or leave it.",58
37778,NEWMAN," Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!",58
37779,RON," Now what the Hell do I care about Al Jolson. I'd just assume her you sing ""Mammy"". Heh heh heh...",58
37780,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...,58
37781,NEWMAN, You are nothing but a piece of crap.,58
37782,RON, Pardon me?,58
37783,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] A piece of crap...,58
37784,NEWMAN, A piece of crap.,58
37785,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...,58
37786,NEWMAN, I find you extremely ugly.,58
37787,RON, *Do* you?,58
37788,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...,58
37789,NEWMAN, You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.,58
37790,RON," Oh, is that right?",58
37791,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] I *loathe* you...,58
37792,NEWMAN, I *loathe* you.,58
37793,RON, That's it. Get out of my store!,58
37794,KRAMER, [In Newman's ear] Make us.,58
37795,NEWMAN, Make us!,58
37796,RON," Oh, I'll make you!",58
37797,AGENCY REP, Do you realize how irresponsible this is? Our agency's sole purpose is to care for senior citizens. And in one fell swoop you've single- handedly destroyed our reputation.,58
37798,JERRY," Yes, but--",58
37799,JERRY, [Into intercom] Yes?,58
37800,TIM," It's Tim Fields, Mr. Fields' son.",58
37801,JERRY," Alright, c'mon up.",58
37802,JERRY," [To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.",58
37803,AGENCY REP, Why were you taking him to the dentist?,58
37804,JERRY," Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--",58
37805,AGENCY REP, What were his false teeth doing in the garbage disposal?,58
37806,JERRY," Well, after he bit my friend--",58
37807,AGENCY REP, Bit your friend?!												% Tim comes into the apartment to temporarily get Jerry off the hook.,58
37808,TIM, What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?!,58
37809,JERRY," I, I'm sorry.",58
37810,TIM, And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?,58
37811,JERRY," Well, I brought them up there to take his records--",58
37812,TIM, Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?,58
37813,KRAMER, Hey.,58
37814,JERRY, There you are. Did you find him?,58
37815,KRAMER," No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.",58
37816,NEWMAN, It was a real melee.,58
37817,KRAMER," Yeah, a real brouhaha...",58
37818,JERRY,"The cosmetic surgery procedures that are available to people today - liposuction, are you familiar with this? This is a fat-sucking machine. Now you know, somewhere, somebody is working on a way that this thing could go into a restaurant. And you could just order it off the menu. 'I tell you what, give me the cheesecake, crank me up to nine, and put a scoop of ice cream on the side.'",59
37819,SIDRA," Oh, hi Jerry.",59
37820,JERRY," Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.",59
37821,SIDRA , Really.,59
37822,JERRY," Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.",59
37823,SIDRA ," Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.",59
37824,JERRY," Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?",59
37825,SIDRA, Thursday night.,59
37826,JERRY, Alright.,59
37827,ELAINE, Good workout?,59
37828,JERRY , Tremendous workout.,59
37829,ELAINE, That's a pretty girl.,59
37830,JERRY, Tremendous girl.,59
37831,ELAINE, She's the one you went out with last night?,59
37832,JERRY, Yeah. I really like her.,59
37833,ELAINE," You know, uh...they're fake.",59
37834,JERRY, What? Don't say that!,59
37835,ELAINE, Nah! They're fake!,59
37836,JERRY, How do you know?,59
37837,ELAINE, I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?,59
37838,JERRY," I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye.  Hi, how ya doin.' ",59
37839,ELAINE," Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?",59
37840,JERRY," Yes, they do!",59
37841,ELAINE, I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.,59
37842,JERRY, A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?,59
37843,ELAINE, No.,59
37844,JERRY," Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.",59
37845,ELAINE, I don't want to see her naked.,59
37846,JERRY," Well, I do.",59
37847,ELAINE," Well, that's your problem.",59
37848,JERRY," Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.",59
37849,ELAINE," Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?",59
37850,JERRY, Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!,59
37851,ELAINE, But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!,59
37852,JERRY," Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.",59
37853,ELAINE, What's his problem?,59
37854,JERRY," Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.",59
37855,ELAINE, Wrong side?,59
37856,JERRY," Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.",59
37857,ELAINE, He can't go left.,59
37858,JERRY," No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?",59
37859,ELAINE," Nah, we just play defense.",59
37860,GEORGE, Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?,59
37861,BETSY," Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit here. I don't hear very well out of this ear  so, I always try to sit to the right of people.",59
37862,GEORGE, I'll shout.,59
37863,BETSY," Well, I really think I feel more comfortable here.",59
37864,GEORGE," C'mon, c'mon... See, now, is that so bad?",59
37865,BETSY, What? ,59
37866,GEORGE ," No, no, the machine'll get it...",59
37867,BETSY," No, no, it's not on...",59
37868,GEORGE, They'll call back.,59
37869,BETSY," But George, what if it's an emergency?",59
37870,GEORGE," In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?",59
37871,BETSY," George, please.  Hello? What?  Oh my god!",59
37872,GEORGE," Alright, maybe four.",59
37873,BETSY," So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice was so ill, I guess it was really a blessing.  Yeah, I'll fly home as soon as I can.  O.k. You, too. Get some sleep. ",59
37874,JERRY, You're sure?,59
37875,ELAINE, Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.,59
37876,JERRY," Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.",59
37877,ELAINE, What? Just 'cause of that?,59
37878,JERRY, Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!,59
37879,ELAINE," Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?",59
37880,JERRY," You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.",59
37881,ELAINE," You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?",59
37882,JERRY," Well, I take it very seriously.",59
37883,ELAINE," You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.",59
37884,KRAMER, Hey.,59
37885,JERRY," Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.",59
37886,KRAMER," Well, I know what they feel like.",59
37887,JERRY, You? How do you know?,59
37888,KRAMER," Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.",59
37889,ELAINE , I thought you hated Los Angeles.,59
37890,KRAMER," I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.",59
37891,JERRY, Real busy now down at the office?,59
37892,KRAMER, No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.,59
37893,ELAINE ," Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.",59
37894,GEORGE, I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.,59
37895,JERRY, You put her on a pedestal.,59
37896,KRAMER, I put them on a dental chair.,59
37897,JERRY, He puts 'em on a dental chair.,59
37898,GEORGE, I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.,59
37899,KRAMER, Whoo. It's like a sauna in here.,59
37900,GEORGE, That's funny. You're a funny guy.,59
37901,JERRY," Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before.  So, you goin' to the funeral?",59
37902,GEORGE," Why, you think I should?",59
37903,JERRY," What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!",59
37904,GEORGE, I'm the consolation guy...?,59
37905,KRAMER, Consolation Guy is big.,59
37906,JERRY, Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.,59
37907,KRAMER, It's like ten dates in one shot.,59
37908,JERRY, This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!,59
37909,GEORGE," It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.",59
37910,KRAMER," Why don't you get a ""death in the family"" fare?",59
37911,GEORGE, What?,59
37912,KRAMER," You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.",59
37913,GEORGE, Really?,59
37914,KRAMER," In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!",59
37915,SIDRA ," So anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn't want to see me again.",59
37916,ELAINE," Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.",59
37917,SIDRA," Oh, that's o.k.",59
37918,ELAINE, Did he give you a reason?,59
37919,SIDRA, Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend.,59
37920,ELAINE, Really?,59
37921,SIDRA, He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.,59
37922,ELAINE," Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?",59
37923,SIDRA, Yes! How did you know?,59
37924,ELAINE," Oh, I know the type.",59
37925,SIDRA, So you can relate?,59
37926,ELAINE," Oh, yeah.",59
37927,SIDRA ," You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.",59
37928,ELAINE," Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. ",59
37929,ELAINE," So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.",59
37930,JERRY, You fell on her?,59
37931,ELAINE, I touched 'em.,59
37932,JERRY, You what?,59
37933,ELAINE, I...touched...'em.,59
37934,JERRY, You touched 'em?!,59
37935,ELAINE," I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!",59
37936,JERRY, Wow.,59
37937,ELAINE, Anyway...they're real.,59
37938,JERRY, Excuse me?!,59
37939,ELAINE, I think they might be real.,59
37940,JERRY," Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.",59
37941,ELAINE, I've touched mine!,59
37942,JERRY, So have I.,59
37943,ELAINE," Oh, right...I forgot. ",59
37944,JERRY," Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.",59
37945,ELAINE," Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.",59
37946,JERRY," Aw, what are you doin' to me? ",59
37947,GEORGE ," You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.",59
37948,CLERK ," Oh, I'm very sorry.",59
37949,KRAMER," I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...",59
37950,CLERK, You poor thing!,59
37951,KRAMER , I...I...,59
37952,GEORGE," You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.",59
37953,CLERK, You're a good friend.,59
37954,GEORGE, I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?,59
37955,CLERK," Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare.",59
37956,GEORGE, The death certificate?,59
37957,CLERK," Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage.",59
37958,GEORGE, What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?,59
37959,CLERK, I know! But it happens.,59
37960,GEORGE," You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?",59
37961,CLERK, That would be $387 round-trip.,59
37962,KRAMER ," Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?",59
37963,CLERK, Yes.,59
37964,JERRY," I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!",59
37965,ELAINE," Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.",59
37966,JERRY," But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?",59
37967,ELAINE, I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!,59
37968,JERRY," Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.",59
37969,KRAMER, Hey!,59
37970,JERRY, Hey. George off to Detroit?,59
37971,KRAMER," Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.",59
37972,ELAINE," Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.",59
37973,KRAMER, Pffft - wrong.,59
37974,JERRY, There's Sidra.,59
37975,KRAMER, There's Salman.,59
37976,JERRY, Where?,59
37977,KRAMER, Talkin' to that woman.,59
37978,JERRY, Talkin' to Sidra?,59
37979,KRAMER," If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman.",59
37980,JERRY, I don't think that's Salman.,59
37981,KRAMER," Well, I don't think they're real.",59
37982,JERRY," If that's Rushdie, they're real.",59
37983,KRAMER," If they're real, that's Rushdie.",59
37984,JERRY," Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.",59
37985,KRAMER," I gotta know, I'm talkin' to Salman.",59
37986,KRAMER," It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.",59
37987,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?",59
37988,KRAMER, My name's Kramer.,59
37989,KRAMER," So, uh...what kind of work do you do?",59
37990,BETSY , Have you met my boyfriend George?,59
37991,AUNT MAY, No! ,59
37992,BETSY," George, this is Aunt May, and Father Jessup. Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy.  This is my boyfriend, George.",59
37993,AUNT MAY," Oh George, how nice of you to come all this way.",59
37994,GEORGE," Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.",59
37995,AUNT MAY," Betsy, dear, have you had anything to eat?",59
37996,BETSY, I'm not very hungry.,59
37997,AUNT MAY, They have some very nice snacks.,59
37998,FATHER JESSUP, I'm about to get myself a snack.,59

38000,FATHER JESSUP, This is my third wake this month. It never gets any easier.,59
38001,GEORGE ," Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. ",59
38002,FATHER JESSUP," You seem to be of great comfort to Betsy, we're very appreciative.",59
38003,GEORGE," Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?",59
38004,KRAMER, C'mon Jerry!,59
38005,JERRY," Oh, how can you be so sure?",59
38006,KRAMER," Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!",59
38007,JERRY," Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!",59
38008,KRAMER," Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!",59
38009,JERRY," Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...",59
38010,KRAMER," What, did you ask her?",59
38011,JERRY, I'm gonna find out tonight.,59
38012,KRAMER ," Oh, yes indeed...",59
38013,DR. ALLENWOOD, Why do you need a death certificate?,59
38014,GEORGE," Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.",59
38015,DR. ALLENWOOD," Well, I suppose I could make a copy of it.",59
38016,GEORGE," Oh, that would be wonderful.",59
38017,DR. ALLENWOOD," It was very nice meeting you, George.",59
38018,GEORGE, Likewise.,59
38019,TIMMY, What are you doing?,59
38020,GEORGE, What?,59
38021,TIMMY, Did...did you just double-dip that chip?,59
38022,GEORGE, Excuse me?,59
38023,TIMMY, You double-dipped the chip!,59
38024,GEORGE," ""Double-dipped""? What are you talking about?",59
38025,TIMMY, You dipped the chip. You took a bite.  And you dipped again.,59
38026,GEORGE, So...?,59
38027,TIMMY," That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on, when you take a chip - just take one dip and end it!",59
38028,GEORGE," Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. ",59
38029,TIMMY," Oh, you don't, huh?",59
38030,GEORGE, No.  You dip the way you want to dip... I'll dip the way I want to dip. ,59
38031,TIMMY, Gimme the chip!  Gimme the chip! ,59
38032,SIDRA," I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy. ",59
38033,JERRY," Hey, would you mind switching seats?",59
38034,SIDRA, Why?,59
38035,JERRY," Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.",59
38036,SIDRA, O.K....,59
38037,JERRY, How ya doin'?,59
38038,SIDRA, Good. How you doin'?,59
38039,JERRY," Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.",59
38040,SIDRA, I hear that's how she died.,59
38041,JERRY," Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.",59
38042,SIDRA," Well, a lot of women are having them done.",59
38043,JERRY, Really?,59
38044,SIDRA, Yeah.,59
38045,JERRY, How do you like that.,59
38046,SIDRA, A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.,59
38047,JERRY," Aw, you know people.",59
38048,SIDRA," It gets a little tiring, it's really none of their business.",59
38049,JERRY," Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.",59
38050,SIDRA, What do you tell them?,59
38051,JERRY, Whatever you want me to tell them.,59
38052,SIDRA," Well, I think you'll find out soon enough.  Aren't you going to get that?",59
38053,JERRY, No.,59
38054,SIDRA, What if it's an emergency?,59
38055,JERRY," Oh, there's no emergency...",59
38056,KRAMER ," Jerry! C'mon, it's an emergency!",59
38057,JERRY," Excuse me.  Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!",59
38058,KRAMER," Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.",59
38059,JERRY, This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?,59
38060,KRAMER," Well, I like yours.",59
38061,JERRY," I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.",59
38062,KRAMER," C'mon, what's wrong with my boys?",59
38063,JERRY, Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.,59
38064,KRAMER," Alright, c'mon!",59
38065,JERRY, Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. ,59
38066,ELAINE," Hi, Jer.",59
38067,JERRY," Oh, hi, Elaine.",59
38068,ELAINE," Oh...hi, Sidra -",59
38069,SIDRA, Hi...Elaine? ,59
38070,JERRY , What are you doing here?,59
38071,ELAINE, I'm looking for Kramer.,59
38072,KRAMER," Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?",59
38073,JERRY," Oh. yeah. Alright.  So, where were we?",59
38074,SIDRA, I was just leaving.,59
38075,JERRY," Right, you were leaving.",59
38076,SIDRA, I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.,59
38077,JERRY, That was an accident!,59
38078,SIDRA," I think you're both mentally ill.  And by the way...they're real, and they're spectacular. ",59
38079,BETSY," Stop it, George! Get out! Get out! I never want to see you again!",59
38080,DR. ALLENWOOD, Go back to New York! Get out!,59
38081,GEORGE," Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. ",59
38082,GEORGE, That's a picture of me next to the coffin.,59
38083,GEORGE," Not even close, huh?",59
38084,JERRY," You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin'  Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.													 													 ",60
38085,GEORGE, You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?,60
38086,JERRY,  Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.,60
38087,GEORGE,  So when're you gonna see her?,60
38088,JERRY, Tonight.,60
38089,GEORGE, What's her name?,60
38090,JERRY, I... don't... know...,60
38091,GEORGE, How could you not know her name?,60
38092,JERRY," I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...",60
38093,JERRY, Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...,60
38094,GEORGE," Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.",60
38095,JERRY," Yeah, I did that too.",60
38096,GEORGE," Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?",60
38097,JERRY, Sure.,60
38098,GEORGE," Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!",60
38099,JERRY, Wow!,60
38100,GEORGE," Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...",60
38101,JERRY, Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.,60
38102,GEORGE, Really? Who?,60
38103,JERRY, Nobody you know...,60
38104,GEORGE, Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...,60
38105,JERRY, Why don't you put it in the *bank*?,60
38106,GEORGE, The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!,60
38107,JERRY," *Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it...",60
38108,KRAMER," Yeah... All right....Ya got it, eh.",60
38109,JERRY, Yes I did.,60
38110,KRAMER, Yes.,60
38111,GEORGE, What's with the gloves?,60
38112,KRAMER," Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...",60
38113,GEORGE," Huh. What, the whole apartment?",60
38114,KRAMER," The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood.",60
38115,JERRY, Wood is good.,60
38116,KRAMER, Definitely.,60
38117,JERRY, So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?,60
38118,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, whenever you're ready.",60
38119,JERRY," O.K., soon as Elaine gets here.",60
38120,KRAMER, Yep.,60
38121,JERRY," What, you rented ""Home Alone""?",60
38122,GEORGE, Yeah.,60
38123,JERRY, I thought you saw that already...,60
38124,GEORGE," No, I saw ""Home Alone II"".",60
38125,JERRY," Oh, right... But you *hated* it!",60
38126,GEORGE," Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?",60
38127,JERRY, What for?,60
38128,GEORGE," Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.",60
38129,JERRY, All right.. Go ahead.,60
38130,JERRY, Yeah?,60
38131,ELAINE,"  It's me, are you ready to go?",60
38132,JERRY, No. Come on up.,60
38133,KRAMER, I can't work with these!,60
38134,JERRY, What's wrong?,60
38135,KRAMER," Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...",60
38136,JERRY," You said ""gloves""...",60
38137,KRAMER," No, no, these are too thick.  ",60
38138,KRAMER," Oooh, is that ""Home Alone""?",60

38164,JERRY," Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.",60
38165,ELAINE, Well...,60
38166,JERRY, Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.,60
38167,ELAINE, Aha ha ha ,60
38168,KRAMER," All right, lets go.",60
38169,JERRY, All right ,60

38228,DOCTOR, We have to...,60
38229,KRAMER, Mmm-hmm... ,60
38230,DOCTOR, Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?,60

38279,GEORGE, What're you gonna do now?,60

38320,GEORGE, Into the hole?,60
38321,JERRY," Yes, the hole!",60
38322,GEORGE, Didn't they notice it?,60
38323,JERRY, No!,60
38324,GEORGE, How could they not notice it?!?,60
38325,JERRY, Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.,60
38326,GEORGE, W-ca-What did they do?,60
38327,JERRY, They sealed him up with the mint inside.,60
38328,GEORGE, They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him?,60
38329,JERRY, Yes!,60
38330,GEORGE, I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.,60
38331,JERRY, Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!,60
38332,JERRY, Yeah.,60
38333,ELAINE, It's me.,60
38334,JERRY, Come on up.,60
38335,KRAMER, Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge!,60
38336,JERRY, Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!,60
38337,KRAMER," Well, I didn't believe you.",60
38338,JERRY, How could you not believe me?!?,60
38339,KRAMER," Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!",60
38340,JERRY, That's true.,60
38341,KRAMER, It's very refreshing!,60
38342,JERRY," Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...",60
38343,ELAINE, Prognosis... negative.,60
38344,JERRY, Prognosis *negative*!?,60
38345,ELAINE," He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.",60
38346,ELAINE," Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.",60
38347,GEORGE, It's that bleak? ,60
38348,ELAINE, Mmm... ,60
38349,GEORGE," Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...",60
38350,JERRY, We gotta confess.,60
38351,KRAMER, Really?,60
38352,JERRY, Yes!,60
38353,KRAMER, We could be tried for murder...,60

38359,JERRY," Oh yeah, that's the spot...",60
38360,WOMAN, What're you so tense about?,60
38361,JERRY," Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.",60
38362,WOMAN, What?,60
38363,JERRY, Mulva?,60

38375,JERRY," [whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.",60
38376,KRAMER, Oh.,60
38377,JERRY," Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.",60
38378,KRAMER, 10-4.,60
38379,JERRY, O.K. ,60
38380,WOMAN," Oh, hello.",60

38398,JERRY," Yeah, I'm sure...",60
38399,JERRY," Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.",60
38400,GEORGE, No-no Jerry. I wouldn't do that.,60
38401,JERRY, Why?,60
38402,GEORGE," Ehh, You could get in trouble.",60
38403,JERRY," Look, I gotta try and help the guy.",60
38404,GEORGE," Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?",60
38405,JERRY, Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...,60
38406,GEORGE, W-What? What?,60
38407,JERRY," Oh, that's *fantastic*!",60

38409,JERRY, Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!,60
38410,GEORGE," Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.													 													 ",60

38420,GEORGE, Thanks Roy.,60
38421,ROY, Heeyy - there's the guy who saved my life. ,60
38422,DOCTOR," Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.",60
38423,JERRY, What do you mean?,60
38424,DOCTOR," I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above...",60
38425,KRAMER,  Mint?,60
38426,DOCTOR, Those can be very refreshing.,60
38427,ROY, So Elaine... Where are we going for our big dinner on Friday? ,60
38428,ELAINE," Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? ",60
38429,JERRY, I don't think so...,60
38430,ELAINE," We are... that means that we ah, we are...",60
38431,JERRY, I believe we're not...,60
38432,ELAINE,"  Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?",60
38433,JERRY," Well, I'll think about it...",60
38434,WOMAN, Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.,60
38435,JERRY, Really...,60
38436,WOMAN, Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.,60
38437,JERRY," Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?",60
38438,WOMAN, Yeah.,60
38439,JERRY, Do you have it with you?,60
38440,WOMAN," Yeah, it's in my purse.",60
38441,JERRY," Ah, Le'me see.  ",60
38442,WOMAN," Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld. ",60
38443,WOMAN," Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....Joseph Puglia...",60
38444,WOMAN, I had it autographed for my uncle.,60
38445,JERRY," Yeah, I-I know...",60
38446,WOMAN,"  You don't know my name, do you?",60
38447,JERRY, Yes I do.,60
38448,WOMAN, What is it?,60
38449,JERRY, It-it rhymes with a female body part.,60
38450,WOMAN, What is it?,60
38451,JERRY, Mulva...,60
38452,JERRY," Aub, ah, Gipple?",60
38453,JERRY, Loleola?,60
38454,JERRY, Oh! Oh! *Delores*!													 ,60
38455,JERRY," Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''.  And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. ""Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.													 ",60
38456,JERRY,"JERRY: ...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something: if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.",61
38457,JERRY, Is that bothering you?,61
38458,ELAINE," No, not at all...",61

38460,JERRY," [mockingly] ""Please hurry"". Look at you. Look at what you've become.",61

38462,JERRY," Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?",61
38463,ELAINE, I don't want to keep him waiting...,61

38466,WIFE," Andrew, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table?",61
38467,HUSBAND, Leave me alone.,61
38468,JERRY," Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...",61
38469,JERRY," So, where am I dropping you?",61
38470,ELAINE, His place...,61
38471,JERRY, This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...,61
38472,ELAINE, *And* he gets the rest of my chicken...,61
38473,JERRY," So, is tonight ""the night""?",61
38474,ELAINE, You never know...,61
38475,JERRY, Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*!,61
38476,JERRY," Boy, do you smell something?",61

38478,JERRY, What is it?,61
38479,ELAINE, I think it's B.O.!,61
38480,JERRY, What?,61
38481,ELAINE, It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.,61
38482,JERRY, It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.,61
38483,ELAINE, Jerry. It's *B*.*O*.,61
38484,JERRY, But the whole car smells.,61
38485,ELAINE, So?,61
38486,JERRY," So when somebody has B.O., the ""O"" usually stays with the ""B"". Once the ""B"" leaves, the ""O"" goes with it.",61

38507,SUSAN, You okay?,61
38508,GEORGE, Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.,61
38509,SUSAN, And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.,61
38510,GEORGE," Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?",61
38511,SUSAN, I *know* who I'm talking to.,61
38512,GEORGE," Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...",61
38513,SUSAN, I liked women?,61

38516,SUSAN, Since you and I broke up.,61
38517,GEORGE," Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?",61
38518,SUSAN, Yeah.,61

38521,GEORGE," Oh, I, uh--",61
38522,SUSAN," Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''",61
38523,GEORGE," It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.",61
38524,SUSAN," Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?",61
38525,GEORGE," No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...",61
38526,CLERK, Next.,61

38528,SUSAN," Alright, well... Good seeing you, George.",61
38529,GEORGE," Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.",61
38530,CLERK," Uh, what are you returning?",61
38531,GEORGE," [embarrassed pause] ``Rochelle, Rochelle''.",61
38532,CLERK," Ah, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''... ""A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk""...",61
38533,CLERK," Uh, that'll be, uh... $3.49.",61
38534,GEORGE, $3.49? It says $1.49.,61
38535,CLERK," Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not rewinding.",61
38536,GEORGE, What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!,61
38537,KRAMER," George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.",61
38538,GEORGE, I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...,61
38539,JERRY," So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...",61
38540,ELAINE, Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.,61
38541,JERRY, What about skunk?,61
38542,ELAINE, I don't mind skunk.,61
38543,JERRY, Horse manure?,61
38544,ELAINE, I *loooove* horse manure.,61
38545,JERRY," Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.",61
38546,ELAINE, Absolutely.,61
38547,ELAINE," Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?",61
38548,JERRY, It means he's lying.,61
38549,ELAINE, Wow...,61
38550,JERRY, Why? Is that what he told you?,61
38551,ELAINE," Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...",61
38552,JERRY, No. Never.,61
38553,ELAINE, Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.,61
38554,JERRY," Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.",61
38555,ELAINE, Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?,61
38556,JERRY, Anything's *possible*...,61
38557,JERRY, What's the matter with you?,61
38558,KRAMER, Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life...,61
38559,JERRY," Oh yeah, Steinbrenner...",61
38560,KRAMER," I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...",61
38561,JERRY, I know the list...,61
38562,KRAMER, What's that smell?,61
38563,JERRY, What smell?,61
38564,KRAMER, Ooooh... You stink.,61
38565,JERRY, Whatd'ya mean I stink?,61
38566,KRAMER, You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?,61
38567,JERRY," I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!",61
38568,ELAINE, So?,61
38569,JERRY, Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!,61
38570,ELAINE," If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!",61
38571,KRAMER, What happened?,61
38572,JERRY, What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.,61
38573,GEORGE, What is that? B.O.?,61
38574,JERRY, Yeah.,61
38575,GEORGE, This is *unbelievable* B.O.,61
38576,JERRY," I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.",61
38577,GEORGE," So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?",61
38578,JERRY," No, no. It's the valet guy.",61
38579,GEORGE," No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.",61
38580,JERRY," Oh... No, that's ridiculous.",61
38581,GEORGE, What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?,61
38582,JERRY," Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism.",61
38583,GEORGE," The woman she's ""lesbianing"" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.",61
38584,GEORGE," Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!",61
38585,JERRY," There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a ""Smell Gestapo"". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...",61
38586,GEORGE," Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.",61
38587,JERRY, Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...,61
38588,JERRY," Here he is... that's the guy!  No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!",61
38589,RESTAURATEUR," What do you mean-- ""stunk up""?",61
38590,JERRY," I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?",61
38591,GEORGE, Stinks.,61
38592,JERRY, Stinks!,61
38593,RESTAURATEUR," Well, perhaps *you're* the one who has the odour...",61
38594,JERRY," Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!",61
38595,RESTAURATEUR," Really? Well, I smell you now.",61
38596,JERRY, That's from the car!,61
38597,RESTAURATEUR," Well, maybe *you're* the one who stunk up the car, rather than the car stinking up you!",61
38598,GEORGE," Oh, it's the chicken and the egg...",61
38599,JERRY," Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.",61
38600,RESTAURATEUR, I don't have time to smell cars.,61
38601,GEORGE, Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...,61
38602,JERRY, You've gotta smell the car,61
38603,RESTAURATEUR, I'm a busy man,61
38604,JERRY, C'mon! One whiff!,61
38605,RESTAURATEUR," Alright, one whiff...",61
38606,RESTAURATEUR, Alright! I give up! I admit it! It stinks! Now will you let me out!,61
38607,JERRY," Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?",61
38608,RESTAURATEUR, Yes! 50 dollars! I'll give you 50 dollars!,61
38609,RESTAURATEUR," I'm not paying for *that*. They've already got my seven dollars... [sarcastically] ""...erotic journey from Milan to Minsk""...",61
38610,CARL, The valet had such bad B.O.?,61
38611,ELAINE," Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The ""O"" went from the valet's ""B"", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...",61
38612,CARL, That's a relief...,61
38613,ELAINE, What?,61
38614,CARL, It's still there...,61
38615,ELAINE," No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!",61
38616,GEORGE," Listen, I gotta ask you",61
38617,CLERK, That'll be $98.00.,61
38618,GEORGE, What $98.00?,61
38619,CLERK, That's what I said. $98.00.,61
38620,GEORGE, How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?,61
38621,GEORGE," So, was it me?",61
38622,SUSAN," Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here.",61
38623,GEORGE," Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.",61
38624,SUSAN," Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go.",61
38625,GEORGE," Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?",61
38626,SUSAN, You're an idiot.,61
38627,GEORGE, Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question.,61
38628,SUSAN," I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad.",61
38629,GEORGE, It's not me! It's the car!,61
38630,MONA, I didn't think I'd come.,61
38631,KRAMER, I knew you would.,61
38632,MONA," Oh, Kramer!",61
38633,CAR WASHER," We spray everything with Ozium-D, let it de-ionise, vacuum the spray out with a de-ionising machine. Hit it with high-pressure compressed air, and wet-dry vac it to extract the remaining liquids. We top it off with one of our seven air-fresheners, in your case, I would recommend the Jasmine, or the Potpourri.",61
38634,JERRY, Let's do it.,61
38635,HAIRDRESSER," The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils. Then, we put you under a vapour machine, and then a heated cap. Then, we shampoo and shampoo and condition and condition. Then, we saturate the hair in diluted vinegar-- two parts vinegar, 10 parts water. Now, if that doesn't work, we have one last resort. Tomato sauce.",61
38636,ELAINE, Tomato Sauce?													 ,61
38637,JERRY, Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!,61
38638,CARL, It still smells.,61
38639,JERRY, It still smells!,61
38640,GEORGE, How could it still smell after all that?,61
38641,JERRY, I don't know!,61
38642,GEORGE," Well, what are you gonna do?",61
38643,JERRY," I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!",61
38644,GEORGE, You're *selling* the car!?,61
38645,JERRY, You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.,61
38646,GEORGE, Maybe I'll buy it.,61
38647,JERRY, Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!,61
38648,ELAINE, I still smell!,61
38649,JERRY, You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!,61
38650,SUSAN," Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!",61
38651,JERRY, Susan!,61
38652,SUSAN, Kramer!,61
38653,JERRY, What is going on?,61
38654,SUSAN," You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me.",61
38655,GEORGE, He stole your girlfriend?,61
38656,SUSAN, Yes. She's in *love* with him.,61
38657,GEORGE," Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.",61
38658,JERRY, That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...,61
38659,ELAINE," Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--",61
38660,KRAMER, I'm Kramer.,61
38661,GEORGE, I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?,61
38662,SUSAN, I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.,61
38663,GEORGE, Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...,61
38664,SUSAN, You think so?,61
38665,GEORGE," Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.",61
38666,SUSAN, You're very sweet...,61
38667,GEORGE," Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.",61
38668,SUSAN, Really?,61
38669,GEORGE," Yeah, you're just so... hip.",61
38670,GEORGE," Oh, my God...",61
38671,SUSAN, What?,61
38672,GEORGE, It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.,61
38673,ALLISON, George?,61
38674,GEORGE," Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?",61
38675,ALLISON," Good. You know, you owe me $50...",61
38676,GEORGE," Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.",61
38677,ALLISON, Nice to meet you...,61
38678,SUSAN, Nice to meet you...,61
38679,ALLISON, That's a beautiful vest...,61
38680,SUSAN, Thank you...,61
38681,KRAMER," I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.",61
38682,SALESMAN, What year did you say this was?,61
38683,JERRY, '90.,61
38684,KRAMER," Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.",61
38685,JERRY, That's strange...,61
38686,SALESMAN, How many miles you got on this thing?,61
38687,JERRY, 23 000.,61
38688,KRAMER," And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...",61
38689,JERRY, Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!,61
38690,SALESMAN, I can't sell this car.,61
38691,JERRY, This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!,61
38692,HAIRDRESSER," So, what do you want to do?",61
38693,ELAINE, Sauce me.,61
38694,JERRY,"JERRY: I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce: you get impeached and you're not even the president!",62
38695,GEORGE," Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?",62
38696,ELAINE, We don't walk that fast...,62
38697,GEORGE, No seriously...,62
38698,ELAINE," Seriously, we don't.",62
38699,GEORGE," The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.",62
38700,ELAINE,"  Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!",62
38701,ELAINE," Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?",62
38702,JERRY," Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.",62
38703,GEORGE, I gotta buy a present now?,62
38704,ELAINE," Of course you do, it's an engagement party.",62
38705,GEORGE," It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.",62
38706,JERRY, You don't like the Drake?,62
38707,GEORGE, Hate the Drake.,62
38708,ELAINE, I *love* the Drake.,62
38709,JERRY, How could you not like the Drake?,62
38710,GEORGE, Who's the Drake?,62
38711,ELAINE," ""Who's the Drake""?",62
38712,JERRY, The Drake is good!,62
38713,ELAINE," So listen, what are you gonna get him?",62
38714,GEORGE, I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! ,62
38715,JERRY," Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!",62
38716,ELAINE, So what? That's easy.,62
38717,JERRY, Easy?,62
38718,ELAINE," Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?",62
38719,KRAMER," Uh, no, no, not yet.",62
38720,JERRY, Do you like the Drake?,62
38721,KRAMER, I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!,62
38722,ELAINE, I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.,62
38723,KRAMER,  That's a nice triangle...,62
38724,JERRY, It's Isosceles,62
38725,KRAMER," Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.",62
38726,ELAINE," Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.",62
38727,JERRY, The chip-in!,62
38728,ELAINE," Hey, a pretty good idea, huh?",62
38729,JERRY, Yeah!,62
38730,KRAMER," Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely!",62
38731,JERRY," You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.",62
38732,KRAMER," No, no! My car's not running.",62
38733,JERRY, What about your father's car?,62
38734,GEORGE," No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.",62
38735,JERRY, Are you serious?,62
38736,GEORGE," You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.",62
38737,JERRY," How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!",62
38738,GEORGE, Good thinking!,62
38739,JERRY, Good to meet you!,62
38740,ELAINE, So what are we gonna get him?,62
38741,JERRY," We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.",62
38742,GEORGE, I like this area. I could live out here.,62
38743,KRAMER," Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.",62
38744,JERRY," Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.",62
38745,GEORGE," Look at this. There's no spaces here.  Excuse me, are you gettin' out?",62
38746,MAN IN CAR, No!,62
38747,KRAMER, Why don't you take a handicap spot...,62
38748,GEORGE, You think?,62
38749,ELAINE," No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.",62
38750,GEORGE, I don't want to walk that far.,62
38751,ELAINE, What if a handicapped person needs it?,62
38752,KRAMER," Oh, come on, they don't drive!",62
38753,JERRY," Yes, they do!",62
38754,KRAMER, Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?,62
38755,JERRY," Well there's spaces there, they must drive!",62
38756,KRAMER," Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.",62
38757,ELAINE," So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?",62
38758,GEORGE," Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the ""party""!",62
38759,KRAMER, I got news for you,62
38760,GEORGE," He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?",62
38761,ELAINE, What does that mean?,62
38762,GEORGE," Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in.",62
38763,KRAMER," Yeah, go ahead.",62
38764,ELAINE, George!,62
38765,GEORGE," Oh, come on, it's five minutes.",62
38766,KRAMER, Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.,62
38767,JERRY, Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?,62
38768,ELAINE," What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...",62
38769,GEORGE," What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...",62
38770,JERRY," No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!",62
38771,ELAINE, Got to *love* the Drake!,62
38772,JERRY," Hey, what's going on over here?",62
38773,ELAINE, Must have been an accident...,62
38774,JERRY,"  Hey, what's going on?",62
38775,WOMAN," Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's...",62
38776,JERRY, Is she OK?,62
38777,WOMAN, I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!,62
38778,JERRY," Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.",62
38779,GEORGE, How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!,62
38780,ELAINE,  Are you happy now?,62
38781,KRAMER, Who would think these people we're gonna be here?,62
38782,JERRY, I don't know...,62
38783,ELAINE, What about the party? What about the Drake?,62
38784,GEORGE, Screw the Drake!,62
38785,JERRY, I love the Drake!,62
38786,KRAMER, Let's just take a bus back to the city.,62
38787,GEORGE, Can't leave the car here!,62
38788,KRAMER, Why not?,62
38789,GEORGE, It's my father's car!,62
38790,MAN, Let's smash it!,62
38791,EVERYBODY, Yeah! Yeah!,62
38792,JERRY, Let's get out of here.,62
38793,GEORGE, What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?,62
38794,JERRY," The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?",62
38795,ELAINE," Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?",62
38796,JERRY," What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...",62
38797,GEORGE," What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!",62
38798,KRAMER, You'd think...,62
38799,GEORGE," I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?",62
38800,KRAMER, Most of them don't even have batteries.,62
38801,GEORGE," Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.",62
38802,KRAMER, Yeah...,62
38803,GEORGE," Well, I'm sorry!",62
38804,ELAINE, Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...,62
38805,GEORGE, How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!,62
38806,JERRY, I got it!  We give the keys to Elaine.,62
38807,ELAINE, Me?,62
38808,JERRY, Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!,62
38809,ELAINE," Oh, they won't?",62
38810,JERRY, Not if they don't know you...,62
38811,ELAINE," I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!",62
38812,KRAMER, No chance in hell!,62
38813,JERRY, What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming,62
38814,GEORGE," That's good, we'll give it a try...",62
38815,ELAINE, That's good...,62
38816,JERRY," That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!",62
38817,KRAMER, Huh?,62
38818,JERRY,"  You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...",62
38819,FRANK, Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!,62
38820,FRANK, A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!,62
38821,GEORGE," Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!",62
38822,ESTELLE,  I told you not to give it to him!,62
38823,FRANK,"  You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!",62
38824,MAHJONG LADY," Frank, the important thing is, he didn't get hurt!",62
38825,FRANK, No it isn't!,62
38826,MAHJONG LADY," So what are you doing now, Georgie?",62
38827,GEORGE, I'm uh... writing a pilot for NBC...,62
38828,FRANK, Where the hell is my paper?,62
38829,MAHJONG LADY, You're writing a pilot?,62
38830,ESTELLE," With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian...",62
38831,MAHJONG LADY, So what's it about?,62
38832,GEORGE," Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge													sentences him to be Jerry's butler.",62
38833,MAHJONG LADY," This is the same situation! Frank, maybe you ought to make him your butler!													",62
38834,ESTELLE," Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!",62
38835,GEORGE," Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...",62
38836,ESTELLE," He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...",62
38837,JERRY,"  So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome...  They loved the TV, *loved* it!",62
38838,ELAINE," Oh, yeah...",62
38839,JERRY,"  Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea.  Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?",62
38840,ELAINE, Sure!,62
38841,JERRY,"  Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...",62
38842,JERRY, The Drake is great!,62
38843,ELAINE, Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.,62
38844,JERRY," Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.",62
38845,JERRY, Yes?,62
38846,GEORGE, It's me.,62
38847,JERRY, Come on up.,62
38848,KRAMER, Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeth's.,62
38849,JERRY, St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?,62
38850,KRAMER," Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.",62
38851,ELAINE, You went to see her?,62
38852,KRAMER, Yeah.,62
38853,JERRY," Wow, what happened?",62
38854,KRAMER, I'm in love.,62
38855,JERRY, What?,62
38856,KRAMER," Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.",62
38857,JERRY," Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.",62
38858,KRAMER," Ah, I'm glad you're here.",62
38859,GEORGE, What?,62
38860,KRAMER," Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.",62
38861,GEORGE, A wheelchair? What for?,62
38862,KRAMER," Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!",62
38863,GEORGE, Doesn't she have collision?,62
38864,KRAMER," George, I'm in love with her!",62
38865,GEORGE," Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.",62
38866,KRAMER, No! She needs it now!,62
38867,GEORGE, What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?,62
38868,KRAMER, Well...,62
38869,ELAINE," Hey, we told you not to park there!",62
38870,GEORGE, Can't we just fix the old one?,62
38871,KRAMER," Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?",62
38872,GEORGE," Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!",62
38873,SALESMAN, This is out best model. The Cougar 9000. It's the Rolls Royce of wheelchairs. This is like... you're almost glad to be handicapped.,62
38874,KRAMER," So now, what's this got?",62
38875,SALESMAN," Inductive joystick, dynamic braking, flip-up arms, it's fully loaded. I put Stephen Hawking in one of these two months ago, he's lovin' it! It's rated number one by Hospital Supply and Prosthetic Magazine.",62
38876,GEORGE, How much?,62
38877,SALESMAN, 6200.,62
38878,GEORGE, Do you have something a little more... less expensive?,62
38879,JERRY,"Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!",62
38880,ELAINE," My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?",62
38881,THE DRAKE," Oh yeah, yeah... it's fantastic...",62
38882,JERRY," I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....",62
38883,ELAINE," Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?",62
38884,JERRY, So where're we eatin'?,62
38885,THE DRAKE," Well, actually... Jerry...",62
38886,ELAINE, I'm *really* hungry!,62
38887,THE DRAKE, ... we just broke up...,62
38888,JERRY, When did this happen?,62
38889,THE DRAKE," About 20 minutes ago... Hey, I am really sorry about this guys... whew!",62
38890,JERRY,  Look at the picture on this thing...,62
38891,ELAINE," Oh, cristal clear!",62
38892,JERRY, They know how to make 'em...,62
38893,ELAINE, Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?,62
38894,THE DRAKE,  Gagliano's... that's pretty good...,62
38895,JERRY, Well... we should...,62
38896,ELAINE, Get movin'...,62
38897,JERRY," Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.",62
38898,ELAINE, Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!,62
38899,ELAINE," Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...",62
38900,SALESMAN," Alright, this one is about 8 years old. Not a scratch on it, it was owned by some lady who only used it to go from the bathroom to the kitchen and to feed her cat.",62
38901,KRAMER, But this'll get you around?,62
38902,SALESMAN," Oh sure, it just doesn't have any of the thrills of the Cougar.",62
38903,GEORGE, Like what?,62
38904,SALESMAN," For example, your tremor-damping.",62
38905,KRAMER, Now what's that?,62
38906,SALESMAN, It helps to control the direction regardless of the operator's tremors or spasticity.,62
38907,KRAMER," Well, is it alright if I try it?",62
38908,SALESMAN, Hop in!,62
38909,KRAMER, Oh yeah!,62
38910,SALESMAN, I tell ya...,62
38911,SALESMAN," When I see someone enjoying themselves like that, it reminds me why I got into this business in the first place.",62
38912,GEORGE, How much?,62
38913,SALESMAN, How about $240?,62
38914,ELAINE, Drake gave her the TV?,62
38915,JERRY, He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.,62
38916,ELAINE," Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!",62
38917,JERRY, I know it is!,62
38918,ELAINE," Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!",62
38919,JERRY, I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.,62
38920,ELAINE, They don't know anybody in Chicago.,62
38921,JERRY," Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.",62
38922,GEORGE, Hey.,62
38923,JERRY," Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up.",62
38924,JERRY, I don't know about defraying.,62
38925,GEORGE, Why?,62
38926,JERRY, We're not gettin' that TV.,62
38927,GEORGE," What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.",62
38928,ELAINE, The Drakette took it.,62
38929,GEORGE," She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.",62
38930,ELAINE," Well, she has it!",62
38931,GEORGE,  I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!,62
38932,GEORGE, Maybe we should call her.,62
38933,ELAINE," Well, who's gonna call?",62
38934,JERRY, You are.,62
38935,ELAINE, What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?,62
38936,JERRY, Because that's your thing!,62
38937,ELAINE," What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my ""thing""?",62
38938,JERRY," Yeah, that's your thing.",62
38939,ELAINE," Alright, gimme the phone... it's my ""thing""...",62
38940,JERRY,"  You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.",62
38941,GEORGE, Really?,62
38942,JERRY, Yeah.,62
38943,GEORGE, I could see that...,62
38944,, Hello?,62
38945,ELAINE," Alison! Hi, this is Elaine...",62
38946,, I gave all the gifts to charity.,62
38947,ELAINE," Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...",62
38948,, I hate the Drake.,62
38949,ELAINE, Everybody does. Bye-bye....,62
38950,ELAINE, She gave it to charity.,62
38951,JERRY, Charity?!? That's apalling.,62
38952,GEORGE, How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!,62
38953,KRAMER," Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!",62
38954,GEORGE, You mean a blessing in disguise?,62
38955,KRAMER, Yeah....,62
38956,LADY," And I would also like to personally thank our gracious host Frank Costanza, who has earned the silver circle award and is our unanimous choice for the United Volunteer Representative of the Month!",62
38957,LADY," Due to his tireless effort, he personally raised over $22,000. That's a lot of wheelchairs!",62
38958,LADY," On behalf of the United Volunteers of Greater New York, we thank you!",62
38959,FRANK, Well... thank you very much!,62
38960,COP, Mr. Costanza?,62
38961,FRANK, Yes?,62
38962,COP, You're under arrest.,62
38963,FRANK, Under arrest? What for?,62
38964,COP," Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-A.",62
38965,FRANK, What's that?,62
38966,COP, Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go...,62
38967,FRANK, George! George!,62
38968,JERRY, Your father got arrested? For what?,62
38969,GEORGE," Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.",62
38970,JERRY, Ho-ly!,62
38971,GEORGE," Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...",62
38972,JERRY, So what are you gonna do?,62
38973,GEORGE, I agreed to become his butler.,62
38974,JERRY, What?,62
38975,JERRY, What's the matter?,62
38976,KRAMER, It's over!,62
38977,JERRY, What's over?,62
38978,KRAMER, Me and Lola....,62
38979,GEORGE, The woman we bought the wheelchair for?,62
38980,KRAMER," Yeah, she dumped me!",62
38981,JERRY, She dumped you?,62
38982,KRAMER, She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?,62
38983,KRAMER," Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?",62
38984,GEORGE, ...you're very attractive...,62
38985,KRAMER, yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!,62
38986,JERRY, Drop dead?,62
38987,GEORGE," Boy, even I never heard that one...",62
38988,JERRY, She's pretty rough!,62
38989,KRAMER, Yeesh-jip!,62
38990,GEORGE," Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.",62
38991,JERRY, 240 bucks?,62
38992,GEORGE," Well, it was slightly used...",62
38993,JERRY, Used?,62
38994,GEORGE, What!?,62
38995,FRANK, You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?,62
38996,FRANK, Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!,62
38997,FRANK," George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me . This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes.",62
38998,GEORGE, Sons of bitches!,62
38999,FRANK," Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her.",62
39000,GEORGE, Big screen TV?,62
39001,FRANK, Do you think you can handle it?,62
39002,ALLISON, Yes?,62
39003,GEORGE," Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.",62
39004,ALLISON," Oh great, it's right over there.",62
39005,KRAMER," Ooh, it's a big one!",62
39006,GEORGE, Who's got the receipt?,62
39007,ELAINE, I do.,62
39008,GEORGE, Will they give us cash?,62
39009,JERRY, That's their policy.,62
39010,GEORGE," I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...",62
39011,KRAMER, Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?,62
39012,GEORGE, What if there is a fire?,62
39013,KRAMER, What are the chances of that?,62
39014,JERRY," To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go",63
39015,KRAMER, Why can't I play Kramer?,63
39016,JERRY, Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!,63
39017,KRAMER, Neither are you.,63
39018,JERRY, I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?,63
39019,KRAMER," Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.",63
39020,JERRY, My grandmother's in the hospital.,63
39021,KRAMER, Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!,63
39022,JERRY, This is real believable.,63
39023,KRAMER, What you didn't think I was really laughing?,63
39024,JERRY, It stinks.,63
39025,KRAMER, Let me see you do it.,63
39026,JERRY, Say something funny.,63
39027,KRAMER, Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.,63
39028,JERRY, Ah..........,63
39029,KRAMER, Mine was better than that! Come on look. ,63
39030,GEORGE, Why are two pretending to be laughing?,63
39031,JERRY, We're acting. ,63
39032,GEORGE," Oh, real good.  Any word from NBC?",63
39033,JERRY, No.,63
39034,GEORGE, I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.,63
39035,KRAMER,  Well at least let me audition.,63
39036,JERRY,  He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.,63
39037,KRAMER,  Yeah!,63
39038,GEORGE, Out of the question.,63
39039,KRAMER, Oughh!,63
39040,GEORGE,  How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? ,63
39041,RUSSELL, I really appreciate you coming.,63
39042,ELAINE," Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...",63
39043,RUSSELL," All right, first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just--It's just--  I don't understand, we went out once...",63
39044,ELAINE, That was two months ago.,63
39045,RUSSELL, Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met... ,63
39046,ELAINE," Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. ",63
39047,RUSSELL, But I want you.,63
39048,ELAINE," God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things .",63
39049,RUSSELL, Is it something I said... or did?,63
39050,ELAINE," Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.",63
39051,RUSSELL," Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.",63
39052,ELAINE," Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that ""Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?"" guy.",63
39053,RUSSELL, Yeah. Anyway it's a ground breaking show.,63
39054,ELAINE, Really? What is it about?,63
39055,RUSSELL,"  Well, really, it's very unusual. It's about nothing.",63
39056,ELAINE,  What do you mean it's about nothing?,63
39057,RUSSELL,"  For example, what did you do today?",63
39058,ELAINE," Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.",63
39059,RUSSELL, There's a show. that's a show.,63
39060,ELAINE," Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work . So...",63
39061,RUSSELL,"  Elaine, When--when--when are we gonna see each other again.",63
39062,ELAINE, I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. .,63
39063,JERRY, Hello? Yeah he's here.  Hey! It's for you.,63
39064,GEORGE, He's getting phone calls here now? ,63
39065,JERRY,  Again with the sweat pants?,63
39066,GEORGE, What? I'm comfortable.,63
39067,JERRY, You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world,63
39068,KRAMER,"  Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. ",63
39069,JERRY,  Who is it?,63
39070,KRAMER, That's NBC.,63
39071,JERRY, NBC!?! Give me the phone!,63
39072,KRAMER, I'm in the middle of a conversation here.,63
39073,JERRY, Get off the phone!,63
39074,KRAMER,"  Look, I'll call you back. ",63
39075,JERRY, You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?,63
39076,KRAMER, Russell Dalrimple's secretary.,63
39077,JERRY, All right. Now you're doing something to help me.  Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot.  Casting tomorrow at NBC. 4,63
39078,GEORGE, What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?,63
39079,DANA," That'd be wonderful George, you'll be rich and successful.",63
39080,GEORGE," Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.",63
39081,DANA, I thought you didn't believe in God?,63
39082,GEORGE, I do for the bad things.,63
39083,DANA, Do you hear what you're saying? God isn't out to get you George. What... What is that on your lip?,63
39084,GEORGE, What?,63
39085,DANA, It's like a discoloration. It's white.,63
39086,GEORGE,"  Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.",63
39087,DANA, You'd better get that checked out.,63
39088,GEORGE, Better get that checked out?,63
39089,DANA, I would.,63
39090,GEORGE," What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?",63
39091,DANA, I'm trying to help you.,63
39092,GEORGE," What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. ",63
39093,DANA, I think you'd better go.,63
39094,GEORGE, Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! ,63
39095,JERRY, Where?,63
39096,GEORGE, Right here. ,63
39097,JERRY," Get out of here, it's nothing. ",63
39098,GEORGE,"  Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?",63
39099,CABBIE," Yeah, it's like a discoloration.",63
39100,GEORGE," Oh, my God.",63
39101,CABBIE," Yeah, it's all white.",63
39102,GEORGE,  It's all white Jerry! It's all white!,63
39103,JERRY, Would you stop?,63
39104,CABBIE, I would get that checked out if I were you.,63
39105,GEORGE," Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.",63
39106,JERRY," If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.",63
39107,GEORGE, Catch what in time?,63
39108,JERRY, Whatever it is.,63
39109,GEORGE, You think it's something?,63
39110,CABBIE," Ah! I hate these bums with their filthy rags. No no no, I don't want it, get away, get away from my car ",63
39111,JERRY,  You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.,63
39112,JOE DEVOLA,  Good luck on the pilot Jerry. ,63
39113,STU,  Yeah I think I see it. It's like a white discoloration.,63
39114,GEORGE,  What do you think it is?,63
39115,JAY, It's like a... white discoloration. ,63
39116,CASTING DIRECTOR," O.K. guys, are we ready to start?",63
39117,JERRY," Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.",63
39118,STU," Oh you know I don't know. I saw him in the hall this morning, I said hello to him. He walked right past me.",63
39119,JAY, He must be worried about the fall schedule.,63
39120,STU," Ah, it's a real bear.",63
39121,GEORGE, Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?,63
39122,STU, Yeah. Right.,63
39123,CASTING DIRECTOR, This is Mark Matts. He'll be auditioning for the role of George. ,63
39124,MARK, Hey how you doing?,63
39125,JERRY,  They've gotta be kidding.,63
39126,GEORGE,  This guy's perfect.,63
39127,CASTING DIRECTOR, O.K. Let's read this. I'll be reading Jerry's part.,63
39128,MARK, Anyone call for Vandelay Industries? ,63
39129,CASTING DIRECTOR, No. Why?,63
39130,MARK," Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when you answer the phone now, you've got to say",63
39131,CASTING DIRECTOR, I'm Vandelay Industries?,63
39132,MARK, Right.,63
39133,CASTING DIRECTOR, What is that?,63
39134,MARK, You're in latex.,63
39135,CASTING DIRECTOR, What do I do with latex?,63
39136,MARK," I don't know, you manufacture it.",63

39148,CASTING DIRECTOR, He was what?,63
39149,MICHAEL, He was you know... he was touching and rubbing. ,63

39176,TOM,  Levels.,63
39177,CASTING DIRECTOR, Levels?,63
39178,TOM," Yeah. I'm getting rid of all, all my furniture. All of it! I'm building... levels... with steps... completely carpeted...  with pillows.  Like Ancient Egypt.",63
39179,CASTING DIRECTOR, I don't know how you're gonna be comfortable like that?,63
39180,TOM, Oh! I'll be comfortable. ,63
39181,GEORGE, Very nice,63

39187,GEORGE, Yeah. Really.,63
39188,TOM," Well, bye.",63

39190,STU," Now, I thought he was really good, very funny.",63
39191,JERRY," Yeah, I liked him.",63
39192,GEORGE, What happened to the raisins?,63
39193,JAY," Yeah, there was a box of raisins there!",63
39194,GEORGE, Did he just steal the raisins?,63
39195,STU, You think he stole them?,63
39196,CASTING DIRECTOR,  This is Martin Van Nostrand.,63
39197,JERRY,  What are you doing here?,63
39198,CASTING DIRECTOR, You two know each other?,63
39199,STU," Wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads.",63
39200,KRAMER, That's true.,63
39201,KRAMER,"  I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in.  Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?",63
39202,STU," I think if you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end.",63
39203,KRAMER, Yeah. Be right back. ,63
39204,ELAINE, So who's playing Elaine?,63
39205,JERRY," Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.",63
39206,ELAINE, Really?,63
39207,JERRY, Yes.,63
39208,ELAINE, Who is it?,63
39209,JERRY," She's an eskimo, actually.",63
39210,ELAINE," Oh, my God ",63
39211,JERRY," She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.",63
39212,ELAINE," Listen, was Russell at the casting?",63
39213,JERRY," No, he didn't show up.",63
39214,ELAINE," You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?",63
39215,JERRY, No. No you're not.,63
39216,ELAINE, Why do I keep setting you up?,63
39217,JERRY, I don't know.,63
39218,ELAINE,"  Could we get a little more?  Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.",63
39219,JERRY, Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?,63
39220,ELAINE, Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.,63
39221,JERRY, Beside that. Look at the waitresses.,63
39222,ELAINE, Yeah? ,63
39223,JERRY, What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?,63
39224,ELAINE, Ah...,63
39225,JERRY, I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?,63
39226,ELAINE," Yes, I would say.",63
39227,JERRY, What's going on here. How is that possible?,63
39228,ELAINE, Do you think it's a coincidence?,63
39229,JERRY, No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.,63
39230,ELAINE,  Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?,63
39231,WAITRESS, He does.  In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone. ,63
39232,ELAINE," You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?",63
39233,JERRY, Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.,63
39234,GEORGE," You see, It's right here. It's all white...",63
39235,DOCTOR, Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.,63
39236,GEORGE, You've never seen this before?,63
39237,DOCTOR, I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. ,63
39238,GEORGE,  A what?,63
39239,DOCTOR, A biopsy.,63
39240,GEORGE, A biopsy?,63
39241,DOCTOR, Yeah.,63
39242,GEORGE, Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?,63
39243,DOCTOR, Well I don't know what it is.,63
39244,GEORGE, A biopsy!,63
39245,JERRY, What did he say?,63
39246,GEORGE, He said he didn't know what it was.,63
39247,JERRY, Alright. So?,63
39248,GEORGE," When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a ""get outta here"". That's what I wanted to hear",63
39249,JERRY," Well, maybe he doesn't have a ""get outta here"" kind of personality.",63
39250,GEORGE," How could you be a doctor and not say ""get outta here""? It should be part of the training at medical school",63
39251,JERRY, Can't you at least die with a little dignity?,63
39252,GEORGE, No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?,63
39253,JERRY, Hey. What happened to you yesterday?,63
39254,KRAMER, I got mugged.,63
39255,GEORGE, You got mugged?,63
39256,JERRY, Mugged?,63
39257,KRAMER," Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.",63
39258,JERRY, Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?,63
39259,KRAMER," It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...",63
39260,JERRY, Yeah?,63
39261,ELAINE, It's me.,63
39262,JERRY, Come on up.,63
39263,KRAMER," But now I have a big problem, buddy.",63
39264,JERRY, What is it?,63
39265,KRAMER," Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.",63
39266,JERRY, You didn't go?,63
39267,KRAMER, No. And now I can't get it back.,63
39268,JERRY, The % thing to do is just not think about it.,63
39269,KRAMER, How could you not think about it?,63
39270,ELAINE, Hey.,63
39271,KRAMER, ,63
39272,ELAINE, What's the matter with him?,63
39273,JERRY, He's a little backed up.,63
39274,ELAINE, Oh...,63
39275,GEORGE, Elaine.,63
39276,ELAINE, So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.,63
39277,JERRY," Oh, the sisters ",63
39278,GEORGE,  Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.,63
39279,ELAINE, So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.,63
39280,GEORGE, Apply for a job? What for?,63
39281,ELAINE," Because, it's discriminatory ",63
39282,GEORGE, It's a coincidence.,63
39283,JERRY, This is what you gonna wear?,63
39284,ELAINE, Yeah.,63
39285,JERRY, You're not gonna get the job.,63
39286,ELAINE, Exactly.,63
39287,JERRY,"  Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. ",63
39288,ELAINE, Who was it?,63
39289,JERRY, TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.,63
39290,ELAINE, What about the dogs?,63
39291,JERRY, They're having sex in the hotel room.,63
39292,SANDI," So, the Elaine character is based on someone you know.",63
39293,JERRY, Yes.,63
39294,SANDI, And she's really your ex-girlfriend?,63
39295,JERRY," Uh, Huh, yeah.",63
39296,SANDI, I want to get to know her from the inside. What is she like? Tell me about her.,63
39297,JERRY," Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.",63
39298,SANDI, How would she eat a hamburger?,63
39299,JERRY, With her hands.,63
39300,SANDI, What about pasta?,63
39301,JERRY, Also with her hands.,63
39302,SANDI, Seriously... I want to experience everything she's experienced.,63
39303,JERRY, Everything?,63
39304,SANDI, Everything.,63
39305,JERRY, All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.,63
39306,SANDI, That's good. What's her favorite movie?,63
39307,JERRY, Shaft.,63
39308,SANDI, You got to get me a picture. What about sex?,63
39309,JERRY, She likes talking during sex.,63
39310,SANDI, Oh... dirty talking?,63
39311,JERRY," No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- ",63
39312,SANDI, Elaine.,63
39313,JERRY, What?,63
39314,SANDI, Call me Elaine.,63
39315,JERRY, All right. Elaine.,63
39316,SANDI, How does Elaine kiss?,63
39317,JERRY, Well--,63
39318,SANDI, Does she kiss... like this? ,63
39319,JERRY," Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--",63
39320,SANDI, Like this? ,63
39321,JERRY, I think you got it.,63
39322,KRAMER," I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look.  Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down...  Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.",63
39323,TOM, I'll have a hamburger. That's it.,63
39324,KRAMER," Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.",63
39325,TOM," This stuff doesn't matter to me. See, I'm gonna do the character like me, not like you.",63
39326,KRAMER, You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.,63
39327,TOM, I'm Kramer.,63
39328,KRAMER," Whoa, I'm Kramer.",63
39329,ELAINE," No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.",63
39330,ELAINE," Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.",63
39331,ELAINE, You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. ,63
39332,ELAINE," Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.",63
39333,FRED, Who's Russ Meyer?,63
39334,ELAINE," Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.",63
39335,FRED," Anyway, go on.",63
39336,ELAINE," Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.",63
39337,FRED,  Paul. Come in for a second. I want you to listen to this.,63
39338,PAUL,  Hi.,63
39339,ELAINE, Hi.,63
39340,FRED," Paul, woman here claims there's a restaurant on the West side that's only hiring large-breasted women.",63
39341,PAUL,  Really?,63
39342,TOM, What do you mean made up?,64
39343,JERRY, It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.,64
39344,TOM, You're crazy.,64
39345,JERRY, No I'm not.  George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?,64
39346,MICHAEL, What do you mean Danish?,64
39347,GEORGE,  This guy stinks. ,64
39348,JERRY, Danish. Is it from Denmark?,64
39349,MICHAEL," No, they make it in New Jersey. It's just a Danishy name.",64
39350,TOM, I can't believe that. They fooled *me* Jerry.,64
39351,RITA,"  Boy, talk about a show about nothing. ",64
39352,GEORGE," Uh, excuse me.  Excuse me.  This--This is not right. May I?  You see, you're going",64
39353,TOM, I'm not gonna say it like that.,64
39354,GEORGE, Just a suggestion. ,64
39355,YELLING GUY,"  All right everybody, take a five.",64
39356,GEORGE,  Yep. That's five!,64
39357,JERRY," George?  I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.",64
39358,GEORGE, Why is that?,64
39359,JERRY," I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?",64
39360,GEORGE," Oh, you're fine... you're fine.  So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?",64
39361,JERRY, Why would he steal a box of raisins?,64
39362,GEORGE," Yeah, it's bizarre. ",64
39363,RITA,  What's with him?  Russell?  Russell?,64
39364,RUSSELL, What?,64
39365,RITA, You O.K.?,64
39366,RUSSELL," Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of something. I'll be back in a second. ",64
39367,SANDI, What's the matter?,64
39368,JERRY, Nothing.,64
39369,SANDI, You're acting weird. Is anything wrong?,64
39370,JERRY, No.,64
39371,SANDI, Are you breaking up with me?,64
39372,JERRY, Are we going out?,64
39373,SANDI," You're breaking up with me, aren't you? ",64
39374,JERRY, Do you want me to break up with you?,64
39375,SANDI, If that's what you want.,64
39376,JERRY, I don't even know what you're talking about.,64
39377,SANDI, Fine. Break up with me.,64
39378,JERRY, All right. We're broken up.,64
39379,SANDI,  Can we still be friends? ,64
39380,GEORGE, Remember when you came to audition for us?,64
39381,TOM, Yeah.,64
39382,GEORGE," There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?",64
39383,TOM, What are you talking about?,64
39384,GEORGE," Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know , maybe you took them with you.",64
39385,TOM, Are you accusing me of stealing the raisins?,64
39386,GEORGE," Oh, no, no--",64
39387,TOM,  Why would I steal a box of raisins!?,64
39388,GEORGE," No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. ",64
39389,TOM," Let me give you a word of advice. O.K.? I want you to stay away from me. I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna hear anymore of your stupid little notes and suggestions. I don't like you. So if you got any other problems whether it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dried fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, O.K.?",64
39390,GEORGE, Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that.  Good talking to you Tom. Really.,64
39391,RUSSELL,"  Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I can't go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine? ",64
39392,DAVID, Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry.,64
39393,RUSSELL, All right. All right. What's your name?,64
39394,DAVID, David Richardson.,64
39395,RUSSELL, Get out! You're fired!,64
39396,DAVID, But Mr. Dalrimple--,64
39397,RUSSELL," Don't talk back to me. Didn't you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now, GET OUT!  What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW! ",64
39398,GEORGE, The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.,64
39399,JERRY, Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.,64
39400,GEORGE, What do you mean?,64
39401,JERRY, Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!,64
39402,GEORGE, Come on you're... uh... you're fine.,64
39403,JERRY, This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.,64
39404,GEORGE, What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.,64
39405,JERRY," This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.",64
39406,GEORGE, The guy playing Kramer threatened me.,64
39407,JERRY, Why?,64
39408,GEORGE, 'cause I asked him about the raisins.,64
39409,JERRY, You mentioned the raisins.,64
39410,GEORGE, Oh yeah.,64
39411,JERRY, Did he take 'em?,64
39412,GEORGE, I don't know.,64
39413,JERRY," Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?",64
39414,GEORGE, That's what I'm trying to find out.,64
39415,JERRY, Hey.,64
39416,KRAMER, Hey.,64
39417,JERRY, Any luck?,64
39418,KRAMER," No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis.",64
39419,JERRY, What about bran?,64
39420,KRAMER," I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.",64
39421,JERRY," Well my friend,  it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.",64
39422,KRAMER," Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.",64
39423,JERRY," Oh, it's not that bad!",64
39424,GEORGE, Yes it is.,64
39425,ELAINE, Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.,64
39426,JERRY,"  So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?",64
39427,ELAINE, No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.,64
39428,JERRY," Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.",64
39429,ELAINE," Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.",64
39430,JERRY, We need you there!,64
39431,ELAINE,  Hey are you gonna go?,64
39432,KRAMER, No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. ,64
39433,SANDI,  No! Pick it up more in the front! It's got to be higher! Higher! Make a wall! A wall!,64
39434,ASSISTANT DRESSER," Sandi, are you in wardrobe? Sandi?",64

39436,ASSISTANT DRESSER, Elaine?,64
39437,SANDI, Yes?,64
39438,WILTON, Elaine? It's me-- Wilton Marshall. Remember? Camp Tioga-- 1978? Remember?,64
39439,ELAINE," Oh, right.",64
39440,WILTON, Wow! You know you haven't changed a bit.,64
39441,MICHAEL, I can't remember my lines!!!,64
39442,JERRY," Just relax, you'll be fine.",64
39443,MICHAEL, I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em!,64
39444,JERRY, You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!,64
39445,MICHAEL, Help me Jerry! Help me!,64
39446,RITA,  Where is Russell?,64
39447,STU, You know I don't know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldn't miss it.,64
39448,JAY, He hasn't been well.,64
39449,STU,  Can I tell you something in confidence? I think it's a woman.,64
39450,RITA, How pathetic.,64
39451,GEORGE," This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. ",64
39452,GEORGE,"  Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.",64
39453,TOM," How would you like it if I just pulled your heart out of your chest right now, and shoved it down your throat?",64
39454,PAT HAZELL, Are you ready to meet our cast?  All right.,64
39455,JERRY," Good evening, folks. How you doing?  Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--",64
39456,JOE DEVOLA,  SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS! ,64
39457,GEORGE," Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?",64
39458,JERRY," Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.",64
39459,GEORGE, Really? What does it mean?,64
39460,JERRY, It means,64
39461,GEORGE, I can see that.,64
39462,ELAINE," See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?",64
39463,JERRY," No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?",64
39464,ELAINE," Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.",64
39465,GEORGE," Yeah, me too.",64
39466,JERRY," Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?",64
39467,ELAINE, No.,64
39468,JERRY, Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...,64
39469,KRAMER," Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!",64
39470,JERRY," Well, well, well.",64
39471,ELAINE, Congratulations.,64
39472,KRAMER," Well, thank you.",64
39473,GEORGE," You went for the big ""E"".",64
39474,KRAMER, Wet and wild.,64
39475,JERRY, All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.,64
39476,KRAMER," Oh, yes.",64
39477,ELAINE," Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet.",64
39478,JERRY, A wallet? Let me see that.,64
39479,ELAINE, Here.,64
39480,JERRY," Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.",64
39481,GEORGE, Shh! This is it!,64
39482,JERRY, How do you like that?,64
39483,JERRY,"How 'bout that seedless watermelon? What an invention, scientists are working on this. You know other scientists devote their lives to fighting cancer, aids, heart disease. These guys are goin' 'No, I'm focusing on melon. Oh sure thousands of people are dying needlessly. But this  that's gotta stop. You ever try to pick a wet one up off the floor? It's almost impossible I'm devoting my life to that.' So I guess if they can get rid of the seeds the rind is goin' next. What do we need that for? Get rid of the rind. They're not going to stop till they're making in the ground ready to eat fruit cups, growin' right out of the ground.",65
39484,JERRY," So, what's her name?",65
39485,GEORGE, Karen.,65
39486,JERRY, Is she nice?,65
39487,GEORGE, Great.,65
39488,JERRY, So you like her?,65
39489,GEORGE, I think so.,65
39490,JERRY, You don't know?,65
39491,GEORGE, I can't tell anymore.,65
39492,JERRY, Well do you feel anything?,65
39493,GEORGE, Feel? What's that?,65
39494,JERRY," All right, let me ask you this",65
39495,GEORGE, Yeah.,65
39496,JERRY, You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?,65
39497,GEORGE, Cleaning,65
39498,JERRY, You do the tub?,65
39499,GEORGE, Yeah.,65
39500,JERRY," On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?",65
39501,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah.",65
39502,JERRY," Okay, I think you're in love!",65
39503,GEORGE, Tub is love?,65
39504,JERRY, Tub is love.,65
39505,GEORGE, Hah.,65
39506,JERRY, So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.,65
39507,GEORGE, Yep. There's one liiiittle problem.,65
39508,JERRY, Sexual?,65
39509,GEORGE, Yeeeaaah.  Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.,65
39510,JERRY, Below the equator?,65
39511,GEORGE, Yeah.,65
39512,JERRY," Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.",65
39513,GEORGE, I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.,65
39514,JERRY, You got the tap?,65
39515,GEORGE," You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. . You know it's like pfffff , all right that's enough, you're through.",65
39516,JERRY, The tap is tough.,65
39517,GEORGE, It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.,65
39518,JERRY, Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.,65
39519,GEORGE," No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.",65
39520,JERRY, It's a very complicated area.,65
39521,GEORGE, You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.,65
39522,JERRY, It's a haaazy mystery.,65
39523,GEORGE," Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.",65
39524,ELAINE, Who's faking?,65
39525,GEORGE, Nothing.,65
39526,ELAINE, Faking what?,65
39527,GEORGE, Nobody's faking.,65
39528,ELAINE, Ah! Orgasm?,65
39529,GEORGE, She's not faking!,65
39530,ELAINE, How do you know?,65
39531,GEORGE," I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?",65
39532,ELAINE, Of course.,65
39533,JERRY, Really?,65
39534,GEORGE, You faked?,65
39535,ELAINE, On occasion.,65
39536,JERRY, And the guy never knows?,65
39537,ELAINE, No.,65
39538,JERRY, How can he not know that?,65
39539,ELAINE, Because I was gooood.,65
39540,JERRY, I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.,65
39541,ELAINE, You didn't know.,65
39542,JERRY, What?,65
39543,ELAINE, You didn't know.,65
39544,JERRY, Are you saying...,65
39545,GEORGE, I think I'll have a piece of cake.,65
39546,JERRY, With me?,65
39547,ELAINE, Well...,65
39548,JERRY, You faked with me?,65
39549,ELAINE, Ye.,65
39550,JERRY, You faked with me?,65
39551,ELAINE, Yeass.,65
39552,JERRY, No.,65
39553,ELAINE, Yeass.,65
39554,JERRY, You faked it?,65
39555,ELAINE, I faked it.,65
39556,JERRY," That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?",65
39557,ELAINE, Not bad huh?,65
39558,JERRY," What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?",65
39559,ELAINE,"  Fake, fake, fake, fake.",65
39560,JERRY," I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?",65
39561,ELAINE," Uuuhm, all the time.",65
39562,JERRY, All the time?!,65
39563,GEORGE, We got a chocolate malt in here!,65
39564,JERRY, But I'm so good.,65
39565,GEORGE, I'm sure you are.,65
39566,ELAINE," Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.",65
39567,JERRY, She faked.,65
39568,JERRY, Maybe they've all been faking.,65
39569,ELAINE, I'm sure they're not.,65
39570,GEORGE, Maybe Karen is faking.,65
39571,KRAMER, She was probably joking.,65
39572,JERRY," No no, it was no joke.",65
39573,KRAMER, She didn't have any?,65
39574,JERRY, No. None.,65
39575,KRAMER,  She faked 'em all.,65
39576,JERRY,  Faked 'em all.,65
39577,KRAMER," Well so she faked 'em, so what?",65
39578,JERRY, The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.,65
39579,KRAMER, You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.,65
39580,JERRY," How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.",65
39581,KRAMER, Yeah I could have helped you out.,65
39582,JERRY, What could you have done?,65
39583,KRAMER, I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.,65
39584,JERRY, I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.,65
39585,KRAMER, Aaaaah.,65
39586,JERRY, Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.,65
39587,KRAMER, Giddy-up.,65
39588,JERRY, Hello... Oh hello Elaine.,65
39589,ELAINE, So we're having dinner tonight?,65
39590,JERRY," I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.",65
39591,ELAINE, Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?,65
39592,JERRY," What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.",65
39593,ELAINE," Nooo, the other thing.",65
39594,JERRY, Oooh that. Well...,65
39595,ELAINE," Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.",65
39596,JERRY, Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?,65
39597,ELAINE, Okay.,65
39598,JERRY, All right.,65
39599,ELAINE," All right, see you later.",65
39600,JERRY, Bye.,65
39601,ELAINE, Bye.,65
39602,ELAINE," Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something",65
39603,RENE," Yeah, sometimes.",65
39604,ELAINE," Really, like when?",65
39605,RENE," Like if we went to a Broadway show, if we had really good seats.  Well you know, if it's enough all ready and I just wanna get some sleep.",65
39606,JERRY, I really don't feel like seeing her.,65
39607,KRAMER," You know, I faked it.",65
39608,JERRY,  What?!,65
39609,KRAMER, Yeah.,65
39610,JERRY, You faked it? Why would you do that?,65
39611,KRAMER," Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.",65
39612,JERRY," Yeah, but why would you...  Bad peach?",65
39613,KRAMER, It's terrible!,65
39614,JERRY, Did you get that at Joe's?,65
39615,KRAMER," Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.",65
39616,JERRY," That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.",65
39617,KRAMER, You know what I'm gonna do?  I'm gonna return this.,65
39618,JERRY, You're returning used fruit?,65
39619,KRAMER, Jerry this peach is sub par.,65
39620,JOE, So what do you want me to do?,65
39621,KRAMER, I want restitution.,65
39622,JOE, Restitution? You want restitution? Why should I give you restitution?,65
39623,KRAMER, Because it's no good.,65
39624,JOE," When you put that fruit out, that's where it ends for me.",65
39625,KRAMER," It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.",65
39626,JOE, I stand behind my fruit.,65
39627,KRAMER, So...,65
39628,JOE," Hey, you got a bad peach? That's an act of God. He makes the peaches. I don't make the peaches, I sell the peaches. You have a problem? You talk to him.",65
39629,KRAMER," You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.",65
39630,JOE, Well let me put a solution for ya,65
39631,KRAMER, Oh now you don't want my business.,65
39632,JOE," No, I don't want your business and from this moment you're banned from the store, you're banned!",65
39633,KRAMER, But what am I gonna do for fruit?,65
39634,KAREN,"  Mmmmm, Mmmm, Hmmhmmhmmm  Mmmm  Woo",65
39635,GEORGE,"  Heh.  You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto.  You have a very contented air over there.  You look very contented, very satisfied.  Are you satisfied?",65
39636,KAREN, I'm very satisfied.,65
39637,GEORGE, I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?,65
39638,KAREN, I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma.,65
39639,GEORGE," Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...",65
39640,KAREN, Maybe.,65
39641,GEORGE, So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?,65
39642,KAREN, Generally.,65
39643,GEORGE, Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?,65
39644,KAREN," Well no, I feel full after the Risotto.",65
39645,GEORGE, Yeah... full.,65
39646,ELAINE," Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo",65
39647,JERRY, Satisfied?,65
39648,ELAINE," Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?",65
39649,JERRY, Meryl Streep?,65
39650,ELAINE, You don't like her?,65
39651,JERRY," Ah, she's okay.",65
39652,ELAINE," I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.",65
39653,JERRY, Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?,65
39654,ELAINE," I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.",65
39655,JERRY," Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?",65
39656,ELAINE, What's the matter?,65
39657,JERRY, Nothing.,65
39658,ELAINE, You're not still thinking about that are you?,65
39659,JERRY, Nooo.,65
39660,ELAINE, Oh good.,65
39661,JERRY, Give me another shot!,65
39662,ELAINE,  What?,65
39663,JERRY," Another shot, I want another shot.",65
39664,ELAINE, You mean...?,65
39665,JERRY, Yes!,65
39666,ELAINE," Oooh no, I don't think so.",65
39667,JERRY," Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!",65
39668,ELAINE," Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.",65
39669,JERRY," Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship .",65
39670,ELAINE," Jerry no, that's important to me.",65
39671,JERRY, We won't ruin the friendship.,65
39672,ELAINE," Ya, Yes we will!",65
39673,JERRY, Elaine...,65
39674,ELAINE," No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.",65
39675,JERRY," A half hour, give me a half our.",65
39676,ELAINE, No!,65
39677,JERRY," Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!",65
39678,ELAINE, Noo!,65
39679,JERRY, You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?,65
39680,ELAINE," What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.",65
39681,JERRY," That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.",65
39682,ELAINE, That is so ridiculous.,65
39683,JERRY," Come on, Elaine!",65
39684,ELAINE, No.,65
39685,JERRY, Elaine?!,65
39686,ELAINE, No!,65
39687,GEORGE, It's Jerry's fault.,65
39688,KAREN, Jerry?,65
39689,GEORGE, Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.,65
39690,KAREN," Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right.",65
39691,GEORGE, So you feel okay?,65
39692,KAREN," Well, it's not like after the Risotto.",65
39693,JERRY, Well good night.,65
39694,ELAINE, I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.,65
39695,JERRY," Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.",65
39696,ELAINE, Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening .,65
39697,JERRY," Oh what, you're upset?",65
39698,ELAINE," Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?",65
39699,JERRY," No I can't, maybe you're faking.",65
39700,ELAINE," I'm really, really sorry I told you that.",65
39701,JERRY, I'm sorry too.,65
39702,ELAINE, Well stop being such a baby.,65
39703,JERRY, You're a baby!,65
39704,ELAINE, You're a baby!,65
39705,GEORGE," It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him",65
39706,JERRY, They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?,65
39707,GEORGE, I hate him!,65
39708,JERRY, You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.,65
39709,GEORGE, It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.,65
39710,KRAMER, Hey.,65
39711,JERRY, Hey.,65
39712,KRAMER," Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?",65
39713,JERRY, Why can't you get it?,65
39714,KRAMER, Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.,65
39715,JERRY, What happened?,65
39716,KRAMER," Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business.",65
39717,GEORGE," Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?",65
39718,JERRY,  No.  I told you not to say anything.,65
39719,KRAMER," Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?",65
39720,JERRY, Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.,65
39721,KRAMER," The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!",65
39722,JERRY, Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?,65
39723,GEORGE," Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?",65
39724,JERRY," Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question",65
39725,JERRY, Patty Lawrence had 'em!,65
39726,KRAMER," Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?",65
39727,JERRY, Yeah.,65
39728,JERRY, Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?,65
39729,JERRY, Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?,65
39730,KRAMER, All right now here's the list. ,65
39731,JERRY, All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?,65
39732,KRAMER, I like mangos.,65
39733,JERRY, Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.,65
39734,KRAMER, Well they gotta be soft.,65
39735,JERRY, How soft?,65
39736,KRAMER, Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.,65
39737,JERRY,"  Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?",65
39738,KRAMER, Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.,65
39739,JERRY, Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?,65

39741,JERRY, Plantains?,65
39742,KRAMER, Yeah.,65
39743,JERRY, What the hell is a plantain.,65
39744,KRAMER, It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.,65
39745,JERRY,  You're not getting any plantains.,65
39746,JERRY, Hey Joe.,65
39747,JOE, How's it going?,65
39748,JERRY," Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.",65
39749,JOE," All right, all right, just hold it right there.",65
39750,JERRY, What?,65
39751,JOE, This fruit isn't for you.,65
39752,JERRY,"  Wha, what are you talking about?",65
39753,JOE," You think I don't know huh? Mangos, plantains, plums with the red on the inside, that's Kramer!",65
39754,JERRY, I can't buy mangos and plantains?,65
39755,JOE," All right, get out!",65
39756,JERRY," You're making a big mistake, Joe!",65
39757,JOE, I'll tell you something else,65
39758,JERRY, Are saying you're banning me from the store?,65
39759,JOE, That's exactly what I'm saying.,65
39760,JERRY, I'm banned?!,65
39761,JOE, You're banned.,65
39762,GEORGE," All right, where do you want it?",65

39765,GEORGE, All right I gotta get going.,65
39766,JERRY, What are you doing?,65
39767,GEORGE, I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.,65
39768,JERRY, You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.,65
39769,GEORGE, I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.,65
39770,KRAMER, This mango is delicious!,65
39771,GEORGE," That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.",65
39772,JERRY," Sorry, I don't have any cash.",65
39773,KRAMER, I only got hundreds.,65
39774,GEORGE, You see... All right I knew it.,65
39775,KRAMER," Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.",65
39776,GEORGE, I don't want any mango.,65
39777,KRAMER," Come on, take some. It's good.",65
39778,GEORGE, Very good. Juicy.,65
39779,KRAMER, Ya.,65
39780,GEORGE," Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.",65
39781,KRAMER, Mmm.,65
39782,JERRY, What?,65
39783,GEORGE, I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!,65
39784,KRAMER, Ya I told you.,65
39785,JERRY, What is it?,65
39786,GEORGE," I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.",65
39787,ELAINE, Hi George.,65
39788,GEORGE," I'm back, baby, I'm back!",65
39789,KRAMER, Want some mango?,65
39790,ELAINE," Noo, thanks.",65
39791,JERRY," Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre.  What brings you here?",65
39792,ELAINE, Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.,65
39793,JERRY, Oh and I've got some things of yours here.,65
39794,ELAINE, I know.,65
39795,JERRY, Well I'll get them.,65
39796,ELAINE, I'm waiting.,65
39797,JERRY, All right.  You got my fins?,65
39798,ELAINE, Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?,65
39799,JERRY, I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?,65
39800,ELAINE, They're next to the fins. You got my cards?,65
39801,JERRY, They're next to the poker chips.,65
39802,ELAINE, All right and that just about... does it.,65
39803,JERRY, I guess.,65
39804,ELAINE," Okay, welp... see you around.",65
39805,JERRY," Yeah, see you.",65
39806,ELAINE," All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.",65
39807,JERRY,  What?,65
39808,ELAINE, Come on!,65
39809,JERRY, Are you serious?,65
39810,ELAINE," Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.",65
39811,JERRY," Sex... to save the friendship.  Well, if we have to  we have to.",65
39812,KAREN," Mmmm, Oh George, oooh.",65
39813,GEORGE," Please, it's not necessary.",65
39814,KAREN, Mmm What's not necessary?,65
39815,GEORGE," The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?",65
39816,KAREN, What are you talking about?,65
39817,GEORGE, What am I talking about? Come on.  You don't think I bought all that? ,65
39818,KAREN," What, what?",65
39819,GEORGE, You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.,65
39820,KAREN, You think I was faking?,65
39821,GEORGE, Come on,65
39822,KAREN, I'd like you to leave.,65
39823,GEORGE, What?,65
39824,KAREN," I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out.",65
39825,GEORGE, But why?,65
39826,KAREN, Because I said so. ,65
39827,GEORGE, I-I-I can't find my glasses.,65
39828,KAREN, Well hurry up.,65
39829,GEORGE, I need to look for my glasses.,65
39830,KAREN,  Get out! Get out!! Get out!!!,65
39831,JERRY, It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff,65
39832,ELAINE, You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?,65
39833,JERRY,"There's no way that moving in with your parents is a sign that your life is right on track. There's no way that you could fake this even, 'Ya things doing great, I've got a terrific girl, I got a great girl, making a lot of money, and if everything goes according to plan I'm gonna be moving back in with my parents soon.' It's like getting busted on a parole violation and getting thrown back into the slammer. 'In the opinion of the board you need further rehabilitation I'm afraid.' And y-you go back into that little room of yours. You feel so huge, it's like you could take your bed and crush it with your hands. You can hold your parents between your fingers  and going 'Why was I so afraid of you people when I was growing up?'",66
39834,GEORGE, I can't believe this.,66
39835,JERRY," Oh, it won't be for that long.",66
39836,GEORGE," How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that.",66
39837,JERRY," Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.",66
39838,GEORGE, How can you compare you parents to my parents?!,66
39839,JERRY, My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!,66
39840,GEORGE, My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!,66
39841,JERRY, My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.,66
39842,GEORGE,"  Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'",66
39843,JERRY, A smirk?,66
39844,GEORGE, Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!,66
39845,JERRY, I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.,66
39846,GEORGE," No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.",66
39847,KRAMER," Alright. I'm ready.  You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?",66
39848,GEORGE, I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.,66
39849,KRAMER," Well, move in here.",66
39850,JERRY,  What's that?,66
39851,KRAMER, Why doesn't he just move in here?,66
39852,GEORGE,"  Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!",66
39853,KRAMER," You can move in with me, if you want.",66
39854,GEORGE,"  Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.",66
39855,ESTELLE, Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!,66
39856,KRAMER," Hello, Mrs. Costanza.",66
39857,JERRY,"  Hello, Mrs. Costanza.",66
39858,ESTELLE,"  Hello, Kramer. Close the door.",66
39859,KRAMER," Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. ",66
39860,ESTELLE, More stuff?!,66
39861,KRAMER, Yeah. ,66
39862,ESTELLE,  How much is there?!,66
39863,GEORGE,  There's more.,66
39864,ESTELLE," So, how are ya, Jerry?",66
39865,JERRY," Fine, Mrs. Costanza.  Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..",66
39866,ESTELLE,"  Nah, not interested.",66
39867,JERRY," No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-",66
39868,ESTELLE,"  Tell it to the audience.  Here,  I made some bologna sandwiches.",66
39869,GEORGE, Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!,66
39870,ESTELLE, What are you talking about?!  Have a sandwich.,66
39871,JERRY,  No thanks.,66
39872,ESTELLE," Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?",66
39873,KRAMER, Uhh.. no thanks. ,66
39874,ESTELLE, I think you're all a little touched in the head.  You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.,66
39875,JERRY, I really don't eat it.,66
39876,ESTELLE, What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?,66
39877,JERRY, I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..,66
39878,KRAMER,"  Alright, that's it. Anything else?",66
39879,GEORGE,"  No, that's it.",66
39880,KRAMER," Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright ",66
39881,JERRY," Well, I guess we'll be going.. ",66
39882,GEORGE,  What? You're going?,66
39883,JERRY, Yeah.,66
39884,GEORGE, Wha - what are you doing later?,66
39885,JERRY," Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.",66
39886,GEORGE, Really?,66
39887,JERRY," Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'",66
39888,GEORGE, Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?,66
39889,ESTELLE," No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.",66
39890,GEORGE,  Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.,66
39891,JERRY," Yeah, take it easy. ",66
39892,GEORGE," Oh, my God.. ",66
39893,ELAINE," Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! ",66
39894,JERRY, Right.,66
39895,ELIANE, You remember that?,66
39896,KRAMER," Yeah, well, that was a good one.",66
39897,JERRY, Well..,66
39898,ELAINE, What's that?,66
39899,JERRY, Excuse me?,66
39900,JERRY, Yeah.. yeah.,66
39901,ELAINE, Yep. Yeah..,66
39902,KRAMER," You know that, uh, Leslie  is in the clothing business? She's a designer.",66
39903,ELAINE,  Oh?,66
39904,KRAMER," In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt.  Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.",66
39905,ELAINE," Oh, a puffy shirt.",66
39906,JERRY, Puffy.,66
39907,KRAMER," Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..",66
39908,KRAMER,  That's true..  I'll be right back. ,66
39909,ELAINE," Uh, o...  Jerry's going to be on the ""Today"" show on Friday.",66
39910,JERRY," Yeah, that's right!",66
39911,ELAINE," Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a  benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the  poor, and the homeless..",66
39912,JERRY,  And the indigent.,66
39913,ELAINE," And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.",66
39914,JERRY, Sure.,66
39915,ELAINE," Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep.",66
39916,JERRY, Uh-huh.,66
39917,ELAINE, Yep.,66
39918,JERRY, Yep..,66
39919,ELAINE, Mmm,66
39920,ESTELLE, Maybe you should take a civil service test.,66
39921,GEORGE,  I'm not taking a civil service test.,66
39922,FRANK," Look at this, George.  You ever seen a silver dollar?",66
39923,GEORGE," Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.",66
39924,ELAINE, Why don't you want to take a civil service test?,66
39925,GEORGE, To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?,66
39926,FRANK," Would you believe when I was 18, I had a ssssilver dollar collection?",66
39927,ESTELLE, I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..,66
39928,GEORGE, I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?,66
39929,FRANK,"  You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia.",66
39930,ESTELLE, So what are you gonna do?!,66
39931,GEORGE, I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!,66
39932,FRANK, I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today. ,66
39933,GEORGE,  Oh my God..,66
39934,FRANK, I don't like this waiter.  Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.,66
39935,GEORGE,  I need some air..,66
39936,ESTELLE," George, where are you going?!",66
39937,GEORGE,  I got a lot of thinking to do.,66
39938,GEORGE," Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. ",66
39939,WOMAN, Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!,66
39940,GEORGE,"  I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..",66
39941,WOMAN," No, no ,no. It's all right. ",66
39942,GEORGE," It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..",66
39943,WOMAN, Hmm..,66
39944,GEORGE, What?,66
39945,WOMAN,  Your hands.,66
39946,GEORGE, What about them?,66
39947,WOMAN, They're quite exquisite!,66
39948,GEORGE, They are?,66
39949,WOMAN,  Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?,66
39950,GEORGE, Hand modeling? ,66
39951,WOMAN,"  Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? ",66
39952,JERRY,  I - I don't get it.,66
39953,GEORGE, Me neither!,66
39954,JERRY, What is it?,66
39955,GEORGE, I don't know.,66
39956,JERRY, They're hands!,66
39957,GEORGE, This woman just set me up for a job!,66
39958,JERRY,"  Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.",66
39959,GEORGE," What, are you kidding?  The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. ",66
39960,JERRY," Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.",66
39961,GEORGE," This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and  I bop into this woman..",66
39962,JERRY, It's just like in the movies.,66
39963,KRAMER, Hey. ,66
39964,JERRY, Hey.,66
39965,KRAMER," Hey, George! ",66
39966,GEORGE," OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!",66
39967,KRAMER, What?!,66
39968,GEORGE, You coulda damaged my hand!,66
39969,KRAMER,"  But, it's only a toy!",66
39970,JERRY,  George has become a hand model.,66
39971,KRAMER, A hand model?,66
39972,JERRY, Yes.,66
39973,KRAMER,  Really? Let me see your hands.,66
39974,GEORGE,"  You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. ",66
39975,KRAMER," Let's see..  oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet  masculine.",66
39976,GEORGE,"  Alright,  I gotta get going.",66
39977,JERRY, Oven mitts?,66
39978,GEORGE,  That's all I could find.  Would you mind getting the door?,66
39979,KRAMER, Yeah..,66
39980,JERRY, Alright. ,66
39981,GEORGE, Thank you very much. ,66
39982,KRAMER," You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..",66
39983,JERRY, Uh-huh..  Since I said what?,66
39984,KRAMER, Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. ,66
39985,JERRY, What are you talking about?,66
39986,KRAMER, When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. ,66
39987,JERRY,  This?,66
39988,KRAMER, Yea.,66
39989,JERRY, I agreed to wear this?!,66
39990,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah.",66
39991,JERRY," But, when did I do that?",66
39992,KRAMER, When we went to dinner the other night.,66
39993,JERRY," What are you, crazy?!",66
39994,KRAMER, What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?,66
39995,JERRY, I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!,66
39996,KRAMER,  There you go.,66
39997,JERRY," Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!",66
39998,KRAMER," Yes, yes! You said it!",66
39999,JERRY," But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!",66
40000,KRAMER,"  Well, she asked you.",66
40001,JERRY," I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!",66
40002,KRAMER," Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em.",66
40003,JERRY, They're making these?,66
40004,KRAMER," Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!",66
40005,JERRY,"  But, I don't want to be a pirate!",66
40006,ESTELLE," I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?",66
40007,FRANK,  Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?,66
40008,ESTELLE,  I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!,66
40009,FRANK, You never mentioned them to me!,66
40010,GEORGE,  Hand me an Emory board.,66
40011,ESTELLE, I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..,66
40012,FRANK, No! You never said milky white!,66
40013,ESTELLE,  I said milky white!,66
40014,GEORGE,  Scissor.  Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!,66
40015,ESTELLE, I'm sorry.,66
40016,GEORGE, You're sorry?!,66
40017,ESTELLE,  I'll try to be more careful.,66
40018,GEORGE,  I hope so. ,66
40019,ESTELLE," Georgie..  Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?",66
40020,FRANK,  Why'd you put the bananas in there?!,66
40021,ESTELLE,  George likes the bananas!,66
40022,FRANK,  So let him have bananas on the side!,66
40023,GEORGE," Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.",66
40024,ESTELLE,  But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O?,66
40025,GEORGE,  I'll take it in my room. ,66
40026,KRAMER," Yeah, come in.",66
40027,STAGEHAND, I just wanted to let you know he's got about five minutes.,66
40028,KRAMER, Giddy-Up.  Jerry! Five minutes!,66
40029,KRAMER, Now that's a great looking shirt!  Aye Captain!  Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect.  Look at it! It's fantastic!,66
40030,JERRY,"  Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this!",66
40031,KRAMER,"  Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the  pirate look!",66
40032,KRAMER, Yeah.,66
40033,ELAINE," Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!",66
40034,KRAMER, Great.,66
40035,ELAINE,  What is that?!,66
40036,KRAMER," It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?",66
40037,ELAINE,  Why're you wearing that now?,66
40038,JERRY,"  'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!",66
40039,ELAINE," When did she,  when did she ask you this?",66
40040,JERRY," When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.",66
40041,ELAINE, I didn't hear anything.,66
40042,JERRY,  Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!,66
40043,ELAINE,"  Well, you can't wear that on the show.",66
40044,KRAMER,"  Elaine, you want to stop?",66
40045,ELAINE,"  Wha- What? No.  Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!",66
40046,JERRY,  I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!,66
40047,ELAINE,"  Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!",66
40048,STAGEHAND,"  Okay, let's go.  Is that what you're wearing?",66
40049,MAN, I've never seen hands like these before..,66
40050,WOMAN, They're so soft and milky white.,66
40051,PHOTOGRAPHER, You know who's hands they remind me of?  Ray McKigney.,66
40052,MAN, Ugh.. Ray.,66
40053,PHOTOGRAPHER, He was it.,66
40054,GEORGE, Who was he?,66
40055,PHOTOGRAPHER," The most exquisite hands you've ever seen.. Oh, he had it all.",66
40056,GEORGE,  What happened to him?,66
40057,MAN,"  Tragic story, I'm afraid. He could've had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his one true love..",66
40058,GEORGE," You mean, uh..?",66
40059,MAN, Yes. he was not.. master of his domain.,66
40060,GEORGE,  But how.. uh..?,66
40061,MAN,"  The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing but a claw.  He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils,  and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadn't seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's until today. You are his successor.  I uh only hope you have a little more self-control.",66
40062,GEORGE,  You don't have to worry about me.  I won a contest.,66
40063,PHOTOGRAPHER," Ok, let's get to work.",66
40064,BRYANT,"  Back now, 7",66
40065,JERRY,"  Thank you, Bryant.",66
40066,BRYANT,"  And speaking of clothing, that is a very, very unusual shirt you have on.",66
40067,JERRY,"  Oh, thank you.",66
40068,BRYANT," You're all kinda,  kinda ""puffed up"". ",66
40069,JERRY," Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.",66
40070,BRYANT,  You look kinda like a pirate.,66
40071,JERRY,"  Yeah.. like a pirate..  Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..",66
40072,BRYANT,"  You.. ah, look, I'm sorry, it is just a VERY unusual shirt. It could be kind of a whole new look for you.. you know, you could put a patch over an eye, you could be kind of like the pirate-comedian.",66
40073,JERRY," Uh-huh, yeah. ",66
40074,BRYANT, Are you going to be wearing the shirt at the concert?,66
40075,JERRY,"  Look, it's not my shirt.",66
40076,BRYANT,  Whose shirt is it?,66
40077,JERRY," What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. ",66
40078,LESLIE,  You bastard!,66
40079,BRYANT,  Did you hear that?,66
40080,JERRY,  THAT I heard.,66
40081,PHOTOGRAPHER,"  Alright, a little to the left.. Little higher, little higher. Good. Perfect! Perfect.",66
40082,GEORGE, Like that?,66
40083,PHOTOGRAPHER," Just like that. Hold it.  Good, ok, let me get just one more, one more.  Good, that's it. You're done.",66
40084,GEORGE, That's it?,66
40085,PHOTOGRAPHER,  That's it.,66
40086,MAN,  And here's your check.  Thank you very much.  It was an honor.,66
40087,WOMAN, It was great working with you.  Your hands are beautiful.,66
40088,GEORGE,"  Oh, thank you very much. ",66
40089,WOMAN," You know, I was wondering - if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together..?",66
40090,LESLIE, You ruined me! You ruined my career!,66
40091,JERRY," Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.",66
40092,LESLIE,"  Oh, I don't give a damn!",66
40093,JERRY,"  You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!",66
40094,GEORGE,"  Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check!  They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!",66
40095,ELAINE," Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.",66
40096,GEORGE, Alright. ,66
40097,ELAINE,"  Yeah, real nice.",66
40098,GEORGE,  Nice shirt..  What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?,66
40099,JERRY, Yeah.,66
40100,GEORGE," What, have you completely lost your mind?",66
40101,KRAMER,  Hey..,66
40102,GEORGE," Who's dressing you?  You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my-  AAHHHH!!!!! ",66
40103,ELAINE, You ready?,66
40104,GEORGE, Ow! Hot! Hot!,66
40105,ELAINE,  I'm sorry.,66
40106,GEORGE,  This McKigney guy had a few good years..  How could you forget to turn off an iron?,66
40107,KRAMER," Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.",66
40108,GEORGE," My whole life is ruined because of the  ""puffy shirt"".",66
40109,JERRY,  It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for,66
40110,ELAINE,"  Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.",66
40111,KRAMER, You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished.  We're  finished.,66
40112,JERRY, Really? What happened?,66
40113,KRAMER,  I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.,66
40114,JERRY, What happened with all the shirts?,66
40115,KRAMER, They gave them all to Goodwill.,66
40116,HOMELESS MAN," Ahh, can you spare a little change for an old buccaneer?",66
40117,JERRY,"  You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..",66
40118,ELAINE, Do you ever spit on anybody from here?,67
40119,JERRY, No. You?,67
40120,ELAINE, No. Do you ever think about it?,67
40121,JERRY, Yeah.,67
40122,ELAINE, Me too.,67
40123,KRAMER, Hey.,67
40124,JERRY, Hey.,67
40125,KRAMER, Well I got it!,67
40126,JERRY, You got me the air conditioner?,67
40127,KRAMER, What do you think?,67
40128,JERRY, Beautiful!,67
40129,ELAINE, What air conditioner?,67
40130,KRAMER, Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.,67
40131,JERRY, Is it a good one?,67
40132,KRAMER, Good one? It's the Commando 8.,67
40133,JERRY, Commando 8?,67
40134,KRAMER," 12,000 BTU's.",67
40135,ELAINE, I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.,67
40136,KRAMER," Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning.",67
40137,ELAINE," Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy.  Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.",67
40138,JERRY, All right.,67
40139,KRAMER," Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?",67
40140,JERRY, Yeah.,67
40141,KRAMER," Yeah.  Yeah, rock on!",67
40142,GEORGE, I gotta get out of this city.,67
40143,JERRY, So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? ,67
40144,GEORGE," I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?",67
40145,ELAINE, You don't have an old pair?,67
40146,GEORGE, I broke 'em playing basketball.,67
40147,JERRY, He was running from a bee. ,67
40148,GEORGE, Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.,67
40149,ELAINE," George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?",67
40150,JERRY, There's a lot of change down there.,67
40151,GEORGE," When I find that guy, this much I vow",67
40152,JERRY," We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!",67
40153,GEORGE," What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?",67
40154,ELAINE," Yeah, especially those frames.",67
40155,KRAMER, You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.,67
40156,GEORGE," Yeah, come on.",67
40157,JERRY," Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.",67
40158,GEORGE, Really?,67
40159,KRAMER, Retail is for suckers.,67
40160,GEORGE," Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?",67
40161,KRAMER, You just gotta mention my name.,67
40162,GEORGE, That's it?,67
40163,KRAMER, That's it. ,67
40164,GEORGE, What about these?,67
40165,ELAINE, They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.,67
40166,GEORGE," Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.",67
40167,JERRY,"  Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.",67
40168,ELAINE," Now those look good, they're very bold.",67
40169,GEORGE," Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?",67
40170,JERRY,  I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.,67
40171,ELAINE," Hi there, little doggy.  Do you mind if I pet your dog?",67
40172,DOG OWNER, It's okay with me.,67
40173,ELAINE, Hey little doggy.  Aaah!,67
40174,DWAYNE," Hey, you can't have that dog in here.",67
40175,JERRY, Are you okay? Did he bite ya?,67
40176,GEORGE, Can you believe that guy?,67
40177,ELAINE," I'm okay, it's just a nip.",67
40178,GEORGE, He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time!  You! Dog man!,67
40179,ELAINE, My leg looks pretty bad.,67
40180,JERRY, Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.,67
40181,ELAINE, Okay.,67
40182,JERRY,"  Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?",67
40183,GEORGE," Uuh, no, no.",67
40184,JERRY," All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.",67
40185,GEORGE,"  Good, good, do that.",67
40186,JERRY, What's the matter?,67
40187,GEORGE," Oh, no, nothing.",67
40188,JERRY, What is it?,67
40189,GEORGE, I can't tell you.,67
40190,ELAINE,"  Jerry, can we go?",67
40191,JERRY," Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second.  What do you mean you can't tell me?",67
40192,GEORGE," I can't tell you, don't ask.",67
40193,JERRY, I'm asking!,67
40194,ELAINE," Jerry, my leg.",67
40195,JERRY," Yeah, yeah, take care of it.  Come on, George, what is it?",67
40196,GEORGE, I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.,67
40197,JERRY, What?,67
40198,GEORGE, They were right outside!,67
40199,JERRY, Amy and Jeffrey?,67
40200,GEORGE, Yes!,67
40201,JERRY, Are you sure?,67
40202,GEORGE," Yes, positive.",67
40203,JERRY," But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.",67
40204,GEORGE, I know! I was squinting.,67
40205,ELAINE," Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.",67
40206,JERRY, We're gonna have to talk about this later.  Thank you. Taxi!,67
40207,GEORGE,"  Excuse me, what do you think of these?",67
40208,DWAYNE," Oh, we just got those in. It's a very exciting new frame.",67
40209,GEORGE," Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.",67
40210,DWAYNE," All right, do you have a prescription?",67
40211,GEORGE, Yeah.  Kramer...,67
40212,DWAYNE, What?,67
40213,GEORGE, Kramer...,67
40214,DWAYNE, What about him?,67
40215,GEORGE, You do know Kramer?,67
40216,DWAYNE, Yes...,67
40217,GEORGE," Well, I'm mentioning his name.",67
40218,DWAYNE, Why?,67
40219,GEORGE, Because... you know...,67
40220,DWAYNE," No, I don't know. Look, I'm gonna need a deposit on these.",67
40221,ELAINE," Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!",67
40222,JERRY," Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.",67
40223,ELAINE," Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!",67
40224,JERRY, But he was squinting.,67
40225,ELAINE, So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.,67
40226,JERRY," Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!",67
40227,DOCTER, Okay.,67
40228,ELAINE, Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?,67
40229,DOCTER," Not shot, dog bite.",67
40230,ELAINE," No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?",67
40231,DOCTER," Not shot, dog bite. Woof woof, not bang bang.",67
40232,JERRY," Nah, look at this. Cable's out.",67
40233,AMY," Oh that's okay, we don't have to watch tv.",67
40234,JERRY," No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing.  I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?",67
40235,AMY, Yesterday?,67
40236,JERRY," Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.",67
40237,AMY, I didn't do anything.,67
40238,JERRY,  Oh you must have done something.,67
40239,AMY," No, nothing really.",67
40240,JERRY, Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?,67
40241,AMY," Well, I did go out for a little while.",67
40242,JERRY," Well, your day's getting more interesting already.  Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.",67
40243,AMY, You can't thrust anyone.,67
40244,JERRY," No you can't.  Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?",67
40245,AMY, What are you talking about?,67
40246,JERRY," Look, my friend saw you.",67
40247,AMY, Saw me? With who?,67
40248,JERRY, You tell me.,67
40249,AMY, There's nothing to tell.,67
40250,JERRY, There isn't?,67
40251,AMY, No.,67
40252,JERRY, Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?,67
40253,AMY, I had a feeling this was to good to be true.,67
40254,JERRY, Why?,67
40255,AMY, I knew there had to be another side to you.,67
40256,JERRY," No, no, there's no side!",67
40257,AMY," There is a side, an ugly side.",67
40258,JERRY," No, no, no ugly side.",67
40259,AMY," Look, I think I'm gonna go.",67
40260,JERRY, Why?,67
40261,AMY, It's really hot in here.,67
40262,JERRY," Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?",67
40263,AMY, Yeah. When you getting an air conditioner?,67
40264,JERRY, It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.,67
40265,JERRY, I was an idiot for listening to you!,67
40266,GEORGE," Hey, I saw what I saw.",67
40267,JERRY," Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.",67
40268,GEORGE, What side?,67
40269,JERRY," A bad side, an ugly side.",67
40270,GEORGE," Ooh, so what?",67
40271,JERRY, So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.,67
40272,GEORGE, Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?,67
40273,JERRY," Ah, he'd just deny it.",67
40274,GEORGE, There must be some way to find out.,67
40275,JERRY, Amy said nothing happened.,67
40276,GEORGE," What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!",67
40277,JERRY," Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!",67
40278,GEORGE, I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough?  I was spotting those raccoons.,67
40279,JERRY," They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.",67
40280,GEORGE,"  Hey look, a dime.",67
40281,GEORGE," Heh, Mercury head. You mind?",67
40282,JERRY,"  No, keep it.  Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.",67
40283,ELAINE, There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.,67
40284,JERRY, A little white dog?,67
40285,ELAINE, Yeah.,67
40286,JERRY, Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?,67
40287,ELAINE, I'm afraid of dogs now.,67
40288,JERRY, He's like a squirrel.,67
40289,ELAINE, Well he frightened me.,67
40290,GEORGE, Did you get the shot?,67
40291,ELAINE, No. He said I didn't need a shot.,67
40292,GEORGE, You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?,67
40293,ELAINE," What, you think I should have?",67
40294,JERRY," You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.",67
40295,ELAINE," All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.",67
40296,KRAMER, The AC is on it's way.,67
40297,GEORGE," Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.",67
40298,KRAMER, What?,67
40299,GEORGE," That's right, no discount!",67
40300,KRAMER, Well did you mention my name?,67
40301,GEORGE," Yes, I mentioned your name.",67
40302,KRAMER, And?,67
40303,GEORGE," Pbbbs, Bubkis!",67
40304,KRAMER," Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.",67
40305,GEORGE," All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.",67
40306,JERRY," Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!",67
40307,KRAMER, Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!,67
40308,ELAINE," You know, George, that's an onion.",67
40309,GEORGE, Yes it is.,67
40310,ELAINE, He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?,67
40311,GEORGE," I saw them making out, you can believe it.",67
40312,JERRY," I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.",67
40313,KRAMER," Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.",67
40314,JERRY," Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.",67
40315,KRAMER," Right this way, mister Doody!",67
40316,GEORGE,  You'll see I'm right.,67
40317,KRAMER," Hey, Dwayny.",67
40318,DWAYNE, Oh hello Kramer.,67
40319,KRAMER, What is going on here?,67
40320,DWAYNE, What are you talking about?,67
40321,KRAMER, I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.,67
40322,ELAINE, Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...,67
40323,GEORGE," Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.",67
40324,DWAYNE, Who said anything about a discount.,67
40325,KRAMER," Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.",67
40326,DWAYNE, For what?,67
40327,KRAMER, Remember this?,67
40328,DWAYNE, What are you doing?,67
40329,KRAMER, Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?,67
40330,DWAYNE, Put that away!,67
40331,KRAMER," Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!",67
40332,DWAYNE," All right, all right, all right! I'll give him the discount, just put that thing away! This squares us.",67
40333,ELAINE, Can I just have the name...,67
40334,DWAYNE, Out!,67
40335,KRAMER, We'll see you Dwayne.,67
40336,JERRY," I don't know what to tell you, Elton.",67
40337,ELAINE,"  Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies",67
40338,JERRY,  Who picked these out?,67
40339,GEORGE, I did!,67
40340,JERRY, They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.,67
40341,GEORGE, Well Elaine was supposed to help me.,67
40342,ELAINE, Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!,67
40343,JERRY," Hey, hey.",67
40344,ELAINE, I'm sorry... sorry.,67
40345,KRAMER, Commando 8 has arrived!,67
40346,JERRY, Take it to the window.,67
40347,KRAMER, 12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power.  Installed!,67
40348,GEORGE, That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?,67
40349,KRAMER," No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest.  I'll seal that up later, right?",67
40350,JERRY, Just in time for Amy.,67
40351,GEORGE," Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?",67
40352,ELAINE," I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!",67
40353,KRAMER, Of what?,67
40354,JERRY, Rabies.,67
40355,KRAMER," Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!",67
40356,ELAINE," I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!",67
40357,JERRY," Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?",67
40358,ELAINE," I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.",67
40359,KRAMER," No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once.  May I have one of those, madam?",67
40360,GEORGE, Madam? What are you calling me madam for?,67
40361,KRAMER, They're ladies' glasses.,67
40362,KRAMER," Now look here, see it's right here",67
40363,GEORGE, He sold me ladies' glasses!,67
40364,ELAINE, I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.,67
40365,KRAMER," She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious.  She's foaming at the mouth!",67
40366,ELAINE, Is this gonna hurt?,67
40367,DOCTER," Yes, very much.",67
40368,ELAINE, What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?,67
40369,JERRY," Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.",67
40370,ELAINE, Let me tell you this,67
40371,JERRY, He does look like a horse.,67
40372,ELAINE," Yeah, he's got a real horse face.  Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog!  Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!",67
40373,DOG OWNER, Hey who are you calling stupid?,67
40374,JERRY," Hey, shall we spit on him?",67
40375,ELAINE," No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.",67
40376,KRAMER,  Oh myyyy papayaaaa.  The air conditioner!  I think it got the dog!,67
40377,GEORGE," Ah, Oh boy.",67
40378,BLIND MAN," Excuse me, uh I'm new here, would you mind walking me back to my locker?",67
40379,GEORGE," Oh uuh, sure, why not.  Hey, that's the guy.",67
40380,BLIND MAN, What guy?,67
40381,GEORGE, The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em!  Would you pick it up a little?,67
40382,BLIND MAN, Where the hell are we going?,67
40383,GEORGE," He's getting on a bus, damn!  Those are nice glasses.",67
40384,BLIND MAN," I don't like 'em, they pinch my nose.",67
40385,GEORGE, Is that right?,67
40386,GEORGE," Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?",67
40387,DWAYNE,"  Yeah, we can do that.",67
40388,GEORGE, And I'd like a discount.,67
40389,DWAYNE, Why should I give you a discount.,67
40390,GEORGE," Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund.  You gave me ladies' frames!",67
40391,BLIND MAN, What's that about ladies' frames?,67
40392,DOG OWNER," I'm trying to track down that lady that was in here the other day, the one that was messing with my dog.",67
40393,GEORGE," Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.",67
40394,DOG OWNER," Well I would love to talk with her.  She lives on 81st Street, right?",67
40395,GEORGE," No, that's Jerry.",67
40396,DOG OWNER," Really? You wouldn't happen to know what apartment he's in, would you?",67
40397,GEORGE," Yeah, 5A!",67
40398,DOG OWNER, Thanks a lot!,67
40399,AMY, So what are we doing here?,67
40400,JERRY," Oh, you'll find out.",67
40401,AMY," I don't know, you're acting very mysteriously.",67
40402,JERRY," Well, I'm very mysterious by nature.  A lot of women find that attractive.",67
40403,AMY, I find it annoying.,67
40404,JERRY, Oh?,67
40405,UNCLE LEO, Helloooo!,67
40406,JERRY, Uncle Leo?!,67
40407,UNCLE LEO, Come on in.,67
40408,JERRY, This is Amy.,67
40409,UNCLE LEO, Hello Amy.,67
40410,JERRY," Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?",67
40411,UNCLE LEO, Jeffrey went out tonight.,67
40412,JERRY, Ooh! Very convenient.,67
40413,UNCLE LEO," I'm supposed to tape this nature show for him, he loves nature. Botany, zoology. You know his botany teacher from college stays in close touch with him? They became friends!",67
40414,JERRY, Oh really?,67
40415,UNCLE LEO," That's pretty rare! I mean, actual friends! Like equals! They have dinner together, they have discussions...",67
40416,JERRY, Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?,67
40417,UNCLE LEO," Oh yeah yeah, I'll get 'em.",67
40418,JERRY, Thank you.,67
40419,AMY, What tickets?,67
40420,JERRY, To the Paul Simon concert in the park!,67
40421,AMY, We're going to the Paul Simon concert?,67
40422,JERRY," That's right, lady!",67
40423,AMY, Oh what a great surprise!,67
40424,JERRY, I thought you'd like that.,67
40425,AMY," Oooh, so that's why you've been acting so mysteriously.",67
40426,JERRY," Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.",67
40427,UNCLE LEO, You know Jeffrey's favorite animal,67
40428,AMY, Why is that?,67
40429,UNCLE LEO," He likes the spots. Oh uh, here's the tickets.",67
40430,JERRY, Thank you.,67
40431,UNCLE LEO," Oh uh, he asked me to give you a message. He said that uh he's very sorry and uh he hopes you'll forgive 'em.",67
40432,JERRY,  Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!,67
40433,AMY," What are you talking about, I don't know Jeffrey. Oh so this is why you brought me up here?",67
40434,JERRY," Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.",67
40435,UNCLE LEO, What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.,67
40436,JERRY, Oh... oh... wanna get some pizza?,67
40437,GEORGE," Boy, these really do pinch the nose.",67
40438,BLIND MAN, Tough luck! A deal's a deal.,67
40439,GEORGE, Oh my God it is them.,67
40440,JERRY, I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.,67
40441,GEORGE," Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...",67
40442,JERRY,"To me government is basically parents or adults... especially the IRS, the IRS is like Ward and June Cleaver, and we're all Wally and the Beaver and your accountant is Eddy Hascal showing you all these neat tricks to get away with stuff. Which is fine unless you get audited then you don't want some wise guy in a suit just standing there going 'You have a very lovely office here sir.' Because jail is the government's way of sending you to your room and when you meet Whitey and Lumpy in the joint, there's really gonna be something wrong with the Beaver.",68
40443,JERRY," So, does he like you?",68
40444,ELAINE, What do you think?,68
40445,JERRY, You like him?,68
40446,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.",68
40447,GEORGE," So, what's wrong with him?",68
40448,ELAINE," Nothing, and I've looked.",68
40449,GEORGE," Well, I'm sure you'll find something.",68
40450,JERRY," So, how did you meet him?",68
40451,ELAINE, In the office.,68
40452,JERRY," So, he's a writer.",68
40453,ELAINE, Yeah.,68
40454,JERRY," Yeah, big surprise.",68
40455,ELAINE," So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.",68
40456,GEORGE, What are those?,68
40457,ELAINE," Ask your mother,  you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.",68
40458,JERRY," So, what did you do?",68
40459,ELAINE, I said,68
40460,GEORGE," Wow, just felt your material?",68
40461,ELAINE, Yeah...Jake Jarmel.,68
40462,GEORGE, Sounds like a cool guy.,68
40463,JERRY," Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.",68
40464,GEORGE," Jerry, where did you get that sweater?",68
40465,JERRY," Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.",68
40466,GEORGE, I think that's what the back of closets are for.,68
40467,ELAINE," Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. ",68
40468,JERRY,  Hey...,68
40469,ELAINE, Hi.,68
40470,GEORGE, Who's that?,68
40471,JERRY," That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant.",68
40472,GEORGE, I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.,68
40473,ELAINE," Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.",68
40474,JERRY," Hey Barry, how you doing?",68
40475,BARRY," Hey, how are you?",68
40476,JERRY, This is my friend George.,68
40477,BARRY, Hi George. ,68
40478,ELAINE," Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?",68
40479,BARRY," Nothing really.  You, eh, you eat here?",68
40480,JERRY," Yeah, so how's my money?",68
40481,BARRY, Well it's still green. ,68
40482,JERRY," What, you got a cold?",68
40483,BARRY," No, no.",68
40484,ELAINE," Wow, look at that ring.",68
40485,BARRY,"  Oh, uh you like that?  Say uh, where's the bathroom?",68
40486,JERRY," Bathroom uh, bathroom's uh right over there.",68
40487,BARRY,"  Oh, great.",68
40488,JERRY, Did you see that?,68
40489,ELAINE, See what?,68
40490,GEORGE," Yes, I saw that.",68
40491,ELAINE, What?,68
40492,JERRY, What was all that sniffing?,68
40493,ELAINE, I don't know.,68
40494,JERRY, You don't think...?,68
40495,ELAINE," Oh, no! Come on Jerry.",68
40496,GEORGE, He was definitely sniffing.,68
40497,JERRY," I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.",68
40498,ELAINE," No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.",68
40499,JERRY," Then, what was all that sniffing?",68
40500,ELAINE, Maybe it's the cold weather.,68
40501,JERRY, Today's not cold.,68
40502,GEORGE," All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.",68
40503,ELAINE,  Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.,68
40504,FRANK, Why do you need all that ketchup for?,68
40505,GEORGE, This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.,68
40506,FRANK," So I, I talked to Phil Casacof today.",68
40507,ESTELLE, Phil Casacof?,68
40508,FRANK," Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss.",68
40509,GEORGE," Next Friday, what time?",68
40510,FRANK, 2 o'clock.,68
40511,GEORGE, That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.,68
40512,FRANK, You can look for sneakers the next day!,68
40513,ESTELLE, He doesn't know anything about bras.,68
40514,GEORGE," I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?",68
40515,FRANK," Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras?  Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look.",68
40516,ESTELLE, I am not giving him a bra.,68
40517,FRANK, Why not?,68
40518,ESTELLE, Because I don't need him looking at my bra.,68
40519,FRANK," Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!",68
40520,GEORGE, Do we have to...?,68
40521,FRANK, You don't even know what they're made from.,68
40522,GEORGE, They are made from lycra-spandex.,68
40523,FRANK, Get out of here! Lycra-spandex?,68
40524,ESTELLE, I think they are made from lycra-spandex.,68
40525,FRANK, Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet?,68
40526,ESTELLE, I'm not betting!,68
40527,FRANK, Take a look.,68
40528,ESTELLE," All right, I'll get a bra.",68
40529,FRANK, I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!,68
40530,GEORGE, She doesn't want to get a bra.,68
40531,FRANK," I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it.",68
40532,GEORGE," All right, it wouldn't kill me.",68
40533,FRANK," How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the uh cup sizes and all? They have different cups.",68
40534,GEORGE, Yea I-I know about the cups.,68
40535,FRANK," You got the A, the B, the C and the D. That's the biggest.",68
40536,GEORGE, I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.,68
40537,ESTELLE," Here, here's the bra.",68
40538,FRANK, Let me see it.,68
40539,ESTELLE,  100% lycra-spandex.,68
40540,FRANK, Let me see it.,68
40541,ESTELLE," I told you. Here, think you know everything?",68
40542,FRANK," Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it.",68
40543,GEORGE," I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. ",68
40544,ESTELLE, You got ketchup on it!,68
40545,KRAMER," Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing?",68
40546,JERRY," Sniffing, with his nose.",68
40547,KRAMER," Jerry, he probably had a cold.",68
40548,JERRY," No, I asked him.",68
40549,KRAMER," So, what are you saying?",68
40550,JERRY," I don't know, you know, what if...?",68
40551,KRAMER, Drugs? You think he's on drugs?,68
40552,JERRY, I don't know.,68
40553,KRAMER, Jerry,68
40554,JERRY, All I know he was sniffing.,68
40555,KRAMER," Listen, we went in on a CD together.",68
40556,JERRY, I know.,68
40557,KRAMER," And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.",68
40558,JERRY," Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.",68
40559,KRAMER," Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?",68
40560,JERRY," No, he didn't use 'man'.",68
40561,KRAMER," I mean when he was leaving did he say ""I'm splittin'""?",68
40562,JERRY," No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.",68
40563,KRAMER, Whoh!,68
40564,JERRY, Do you think that's a bad sign?,68
40565,KRAMER," Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?",68
40566,JERRY, I don't know.  This sweater really itches me. You want it?,68
40567,KRAMER,  Yeah.,68
40568,ELAINE," Hello.... hello, oh...",68
40569,JAKE," Well, you notice anything?",68
40570,ELAINE," You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.",68
40571,JAKE, Ooh...,68
40572,ELAINE, Did anyone call?,68
40573,JAKE," You got a few messages, I wrote them down.",68
40574,ELAINE, Where are they?,68
40575,JAKE," Lets see, they are  here they are.",68
40576,ELAINE," Thank you.  Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?",68
40577,JAKE, She did.,68
40578,ELAINE," She did? Oh, that's so great!",68
40579,JAKE, Where do you keep the corkscrew?,68
40580,ELAINE, In the drawer on the right. Hmm...,68
40581,JAKE, What?,68
40582,ELAINE, Nah it's nothing.,68
40583,JAKE, What is it?,68
40584,ELAINE, It's nothing.,68
40585,JAKE, Tell me.,68
40586,ELAINE," Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?",68
40587,JAKE, What are you talking about?,68
40588,ELAINE," See, right here you wrote ""Myra had the baby"", but you didn't use an exclamation point.",68
40589,JAKE, So?,68
40590,ELAINE," So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.",68
40591,JAKE, What's so curious about it?,68
40592,ELAINE," Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.",68
40593,JAKE," Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.",68
40594,ELAINE, You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.,68
40595,JAKE," Hey look, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.",68
40596,ELAINE, I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.,68
40597,JAKE," Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.",68
40598,ELAINE," Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!",68
40599,JAKE," Well, you can put one on this one",68
40600,JERRY, You're out of your mind you know that.,68
40601,ELAINE, Why?,68
40602,JERRY, It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.,68
40603,ELAINE," Well, I felt a call for one.",68
40604,JERRY," A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.",68
40605,ELAINE, I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.,68
40606,JERRY, George was right. Didn't take you long.,68

40683,KRAMER, Well that's a burgeoning continent.,68
40684,BARRY," Well, they are expanding their economic base.",68

40699,GEORGE," Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.",68
40700,FARKUS, Have you ever sold a woman's line before?,68

40702,FARKUS, Hum. tell me about it.,68
40703,GEORGE," Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew",68
40704,FARKUS, That's an incredible story. You have a remarkable passion for brassieres.,68
40705,GEORGE," Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?",68

40720,ELAINE," You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman?",68
40721,LIPPMAN, I was just uh going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand you worked with him very closely on this.,68
40722,ELAINE, Yes  yes I did.,68
40723,LIPPMAN," And uh, anyway I was just reading your final edit and um, there seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points.",68
40724,ELAINE," Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.",68
40725,LIPPMAN," Ah,  ""It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!""",68
40726,ELAINE," Right, well...",68

40731,LIPPMAN, Get rid of the exclamation points...,68
40732,ELAINE," Ok, ok ok ...",68
40733,LIPPMAN, I hate exclamation points...,68
40734,ELAINE, ...ok I'll just....,68
40735,JERRY, 'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.',68
40736,KRAMER, Exclamation point.,68
40737,ELAINE, You still have no proof.,68
40738,KRAMER," Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.",68
40739,JERRY, 'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.,68
40740,KRAMER, Double exclamation point!,68

40754,KRAMER, What's the matter? You've got a cold?,68
40755,RALPH," No man  Kramer, what is this?",68
40756,KRAMER, It's a sweater.,68
40757,RALPH, What is it made out of?,68
40758,KRAMER," I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.",68
40759,JERRY," Mohair, I think.",68
40760,RALPH," Mohair, that figures, I'm allergic to mohair.",68
40761,JERRY, You mean you just started sniffing?,68
40762,RALPH," Yeah, mohair does it to me every time.",68
40763,JERRY, I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.,68
40764,KRAMER," Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.",68
40765,ELAINE," The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.",68
40766,JERRY," Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!",68
40767,KRAMER, Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.,68
40768,JERRY, The what??,68
40769,NEWMAN, After you.,68
40770,WOMAN, Thank you.,68
40771,WOMAN, Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny!,68
40772,FRANK," What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this?",68
40773,GEORGE," So what, what is so bad about that?",68
40774,ESTELLE, Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity!,68
40775,FRANK," What ever happened to ""Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?""!!",68
40776,ELAINE, You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.,68
40777,JERRY," Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.",68
40778,ELAINE, What is this?,68
40779,JERRY, It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.,68
40780,ELAINE," He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?",68
40781,JERRY," Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!",68
40782,ELAINE," What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.",68
40783,KRAMER," All right, What about the money?",68
40784,JERRY," What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!",68
40785,NEWMAN," Pair of bear claws, please.",68
40786,WOMAN, Nice.,68
40787,JERRY, Think so?,68
40788,WOMAN," Yeah, what is it?",68
40789,JERRY," Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?",68
40790,JERRY,"Really at the Hospital, the basic treatment everybody gets, is to lie in a bed. What is wrong with the human being, lie down. Doctor never says to you 'Well your condition isn't as bad as we originally thought we want you to kinda  lean against a door jam for seven to ten days. See how that feels'  Alright it's always a bed, unless you goto the emergency room then it's a chair. You were shot, you were stabbed, you were run over. Have a seat. There's always a very uh interesting cultural ethnic mix to the hospital staff isn't it? It's like a local news team in there. The doctor is like the anchor man he's got the white hair, he's in charge, the nurse is like the feature reporter you know. You listen to her but it's always 'And now back to your doctor.' And the orderlies come in with the food and the bed pans and that's like your sports and weather.",69
40791,STAN," ...And then baby's head comes out, and I'm screaming and my brother who's been videotaping the whole thing turns green, his eyes roll up in his head and he blacks out, he drops the camera, the camera breaks, and then, the placenta comes flying out.",69
40792,ELAINE, Whoa.,69
40793,STAN, And then doctor says...,69
40794,JERRY,"  Thanks, that's enough.",69
40795,STAN," Will you look at that kid. Sucking away. Sucking like there's no tomorrow. Suck, suck, suck...",69
40796,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah, yeah.",69
40797,STAN," Look at that Jerry, look at that. Sucking, sucking...",69
40798,JERRY," Yeah, I looked. I saw.",69
40799,STAN," This doesn't make you uncomfortable, does it?",69
40800,JERRY," No, Uncomfortable? Not at all.  My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?",69
40801,STAN, Look at him.,69
40802,JERRY, So how long do they do this?,69
40803,STAN," Jus, a year or two.",69
40804,JERRY, No break?,69
40805,STAN, After that comes the weaning.,69
40806,JERRY," So after the sucking, comes the weaning.",69
40807,ELAINE, First the sucking then the weaning.,69
40808,JERRY," Well, you gotta wean.",69
40809,STAN, Gotta wean.,69
40810,ELAINE, Must wean.,69
40811,GEORGE, What about that spot I got?,69
40812,JERRY," Yeah, I saw the spot.",69
40813,GEORGE," You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot.  I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.",69
40814,JERRY, George...,69
40815,GEORGE," Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself.",69
40816,JERRY,  Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.,69
40817,ELAINE, Did you give him the room number?,69
40818,JERRY," Ya, 1397.",69
40819,KRAMER," 1937, 1937, 1937...",69
40820,PATIENT, Excuse me. Do you know where the elevator is?,69
40821,KRAMER," Uh ya, it's right around the corner there.",69
40822,KRAMER, 1937.,69
40823,KRAMER," Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man!",69
40824,STAN," ..So anyway, Jerry, Elaine, we have something we want to ask you.",69
40825,GEORGE, You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.,69
40826,JERRY, Will you shut up George.,69
40827,ELAINE, I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.,69
40828,JERRY, You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that.,69
40829,STAN, Myra and I would like you and Elaine to be the Godparents of Steven.,69
40830,ELAINE," Huuh, Wow.",69
40831,JERRY, Me? Godfather?,69
40832,STAN, Yes.,69
40833,JERRY,"  Never go against the family, Elaine.",69
40834,ELAINE, What?,69
40835,KRAMER," Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this .",69
40836,GEORGE," Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?",69
40837,KRAMER, I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.,69
40838,GEORGE, A pig-man?,69
40839,KRAMER," A pig-man. Half pig, half man!",69
40840,ELAINE," That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.",69
40841,JERRY,"  Elaine, never ask me about my business!....  ""Godfather.""",69
40842,STAN, The most important thing is you help with the bris.,69
40843,JERRY, The bris?,69
40844,KRAMER, A bris? You mean circumcision?,69
40845,STAN, Ya.,69
40846,KRAMER, I would advise against that.,69
40847,ELAINE," Wha, Kramer. It's a tradition.",69
40848,KRAMER," Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.",69
40849,JERRY," Well, maybe we should.",69
40850,GEORGE,"  Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?",69
40851,KRAMER, I don't know.,69
40852,JERRY, Maybe they're admiring your spot.,69
40853,KRAMER, They're all looking up.,69
40854,GEORGE," Hey, there's a guy up the roof.",69
40855,KRAMER, Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was.,69
40856,GEORGE," Oh well, I hope he doesn't jum...",69
40857,GEORGE, My car! My caaaaarrrr!,69
40858,ELAINE, A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?,69
40859,JERRY, A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.,69
40860,ELAINE," Where am I going to find a Mohel?  Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?",69
40861,JERRY," Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?",69
40862,ELAINE," Hey Jerry, you ever seen one?",69
40863,JERRY, You mean that wasn't uh.,69
40864,ELAINE, Yeah.,69
40865,JERRY, No.. you?,69
40866,ELAINE, Ya.,69
40867,JERRY, What'd you think?,69
40868,ELAINE,"  No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.",69
40869,JERRY, Hey.,69
40870,GEORGE," Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.",69
40871,JERRY," Ah, you're screwed.",69
40872,GEORGE," I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.",69
40873,ELAINE, Well I have to interview a Mohel.,69
40874,JERRY, How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.,69
40875,KRAMER, YEA!,69
40876,JERRY, What's the matter?,69
40877,ELAINE, Are you alright?,69
40878,KRAMER," Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed.  Look at that.",69
40879,JERRY, What now?,69
40880,KRAMER, Look look.,69
40881,JERRY,"  ""Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research"".."" Government funds genetic research at area hospital"" ... Yeah, so?",69
40882,KRAMER," pig-man, baby. pig-man.",69
40883,ELAINE, If I hear about this pig-man one more time...,69
40884,KRAMER," Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties.",69
40885,JERRY," Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!",69
40886,KRAMER, Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.,69
40887,GEORGE," I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, ""Hey he's no pig-man!""",69
40888,JERRY," Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. ""Oo that little tail really turns me on.""",69
40889,ELAINE,  That's just about enough,69
40890,JERRY," Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?",69
40891,ELAINE," Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.",69
40892,KRAMER," You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.",69
40893,ELAINE," Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.",69
40894,GEORGE," But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?",69
40895,KRAMER," It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.",69
40896,GEORGE, Yeah. So how does that help me?,69
40897,JERRY,"  Hey George, you ever see one?",69
40898,GEORGE," Yeah, my roommate in college.",69
40899,JERRY, So what'd you think?,69
40900,GEORGE,  I got used to it.,69
40901,JERRY," Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.",69
40902,KRAMER," Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same.",69
40903,JERRY," Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this.  You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.",69
40904,KRAMER," Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished ""oink"" of pig-man cries out for help.",69
40905,JERRY," Well, if I hear an anguished ""oink"", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look  Human, human, human...   Wait a second! ",69
40906,KRAMER, What?!,69
40907,JERRY," Oh, it's George.",69
40908,GEORGE, Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.,69
40909,KRAMER, Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?,69
40910,GEORGE, The pig-man can take the bus.,69
40911,KRAMER," George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.",69
40912,GEORGE, How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?,69
40913,KRAMER, Be realistic George.,69
40914,GEORGE," I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.",69
40915,KRAMER, Yea.,69
40916,MRS. SWEEDLER," Mr. Costanza, come in, come in. It's been a very trying couple of days around the hospital. Doctors, patients, everyone, just grief stricken over this unfortunate occurrence.",69
40917,GEORGE," Well, I join them in their grief.",69
40918,MRS. SWEEDLER," Horrible thing. Flew right past the children's wing. All the sick children, in the playroom, looking out the window, just traumatized by the incident. Apparently, they thought he was flying. You know how children are, ""Oh look. A man is flying. A man is flying"" And then, splat...",69
40919,GEORGE," That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?",69
40920,MRS. SWEEDLER, Mrs. Sweedler's fine.,69
40921,GEORGE," Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.",69
40922,MRS. SWEEDLER, How is that?,69
40923,GEORGE," Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.",69
40924,MRS. SWEEDLER, Well I have known bald men who owned convertibles. They wore a hat.,69
40925,GEORGE," Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.",69
40926,GEORGE," Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.",69
40927,MRS. SWEEDLER, Mr.Constanza.,69
40928,GEORGE, Yes.,69
40929,MRS. SWEEDLER, A man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise -,69
40930,GEORGE, Yes.,69
40931,MRS. SWEEDLER," ... and you greedily, callously want to profit from it?",69
40932,GEORGE,"  Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..",69
40933,MRS. SWEEDLER," Get out! Get out, now! Get out of my office.",69
40934,GEORGE, Should I leave this..?,69
40935,MRS. SWEEDLER, GET OUT!,69
40936,KRAMER," Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?",69
40937,RESIDENT, I don't know what you're talking about.,69
40938,KRAMER, You know. .,69
40939,RESIDENT, No.,69
40940,KRAMER,  This doesn't look familiar to you?,69
40941,RESIDENT," Uh, Sir?",69
40942,KRAMER," Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink.",69
40943,RESIDENT, Yes well if you'll excuse me. I really have some patients I have to attend to.,69
40944,KRAMER,"  Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!",69
40945,RESIDENT, Half-what?,69
40946,KRAMER," You know what I mean - pork, sausage,  A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.",69
40947,RESIDENT, I think he's been released.,69
40948,KRAMER, He's lying.,69
40949,JERRY," Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.",69
40950,KRAMER, Alright you go ahead.,69
40951,JERRY, Kramer.,69
40952,JERRY, Where's the Mohel?,69
40953,ELAINE, He'll be here.,69
40954,JERRY, He's late already.,69
40955,ELAINE, Relax. You'd think you were getting whacked.,69
40956,JERRY," I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?",69
40957,ELAINE, I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.,69
40958,JERRY, Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.,69
40959,ELAINE, What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.,69
40960,JERRY, Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.,69
40961,ELAINE, Yes it is level jumping.,69
40962,GEORGE, So uh... been to a bris before?,69
40963,WOMAN, No.,69
40964,GEORGE," I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. ",69
40965,WOMAN, I'm a cardiologist. I think I'll manage.,69
40966,GEORGE, Oh.,69
40967,KRAMER," We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger  cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch.",69
40968,STAN,  Myra?,69
40969,ELAINE," Kramer, what's the matter with you?",69
40970,KRAMER, Me?,69
40971,ELAINE,"  Oh, that's the Mohel.",69
40972,ALL,"  It's the Mohel! the Mohel is here! Thank God, the Mohel is here.",69
40973,ELAINE, Hello.,69
40974,MOHEL,"  Hello, Hello  Hello, I'm the Mohel.",69
40975,JERRY, Hello.,69
40976,MOHEL,"   It's very nice to meet you all...  Oh! What was that?!? Jeez. Scared the hell out of me. My god. I almost had a heart attack!   Ok, I'm fine, I'm fine. Anyway, we're here to perform the mitzvah of the bris...   ...Is the baby gonna cry like that? Is that how the baby cries, with the loud, sustained, squealing cry, 'cause that could pose a problem. Do you have any control of your child 'cause this will be the time to exercise it when baby is crying in that high-pitched, squealing tone that can drive you insane!!!",69
40977,ELAINE, Did you find the place alright?,69
40978,MOHEL," Did I find it alright? Could you send me to a more dangerous neighborhood? I'm dreading walking back to the subway, someone shouldn't crack me over the head and steal my bag, Because I'll be lying there and people will spit on me and empty my pockets. I'll be lying in the gutter like a bum, like a dog, like a mutt, like a mongrel, like an animal! God forbid anybody should help me or call an ambulance. Oh no, that's too much trouble to pick up a phone and press a few buttons. Ahh! What's the point.",69
40979,ELAINE,"  Oh, ya haha.",69
40980,MOHEL,"  Darling, you see where that glass is? How that glass is near the edge of the table. You got the whole table there to put the glass, why you chose the absolute edge, so half the glass is hanging off the table, you breath and that glass falls over, then you're gonna have broken glass on the carpet, embedded in the carpet fibers, deep, deep in the shag, broken glass, bits of broken glass that you never get out. you can't get it out with a vacuum cleaner. Even on your hands and knees with a magnifying glass, you can't get all the pieces, and then you think you got it all and two years later, you're walkin' barefoot and you step on a piece of broken glass and you kill yourself, is that what you want? I don't think you want that, is it? .. Do ya? Huh?",69
40981,ELAINE,  He's very highly recommended. So...,69
40982,MOHEL,  You're holding the baby?,69
40983,GEORGE,"  No, No.",69
40984,MOHEL, Hello! Who's holding the baby?!? Who's holding the baby?,69
40985,JERRY,  Yeah. I'm holding the baby.,69
40986,ELAINE,"  Ok, go.",69
40987,JERRY, I'm going.,69
40988,ELAINE, Go.,69
40989,JERRY, I'm going.,69
40990,ELAINE, C'mon,69
40991,JERRY, Don't push me.,69
40992,MOHEL, Okay. you sit here. Now I need the baby. Bring me the baby. I need the baby!,69
40993,KRAMER," No, I'm not going to let this happen.",69
40994,ALL,  Kramer! Let go of the baby! Kramer!,69
40995,MOHEL," People compose yourselves.  This is a bris. We are performing a bris here, not a burlesque show. This is not a school play! This is not a baggy pants farce! This is a bris. An sacred, ancient ceremony, symbolizing the covenant between God and Abraham... or something.  No! Don't touch it! Don't touch a thing!",69
40996,ELAINE, Ok.,69
40997,MOHEL," .. I coulda been a kosher butcher like my brother. The money's good. There's a union, with benefits. And, cows have no families. You make a mistake with a cow, you move on with your life... Anyway.",69
40998,JERRY, Hurry up George! Step on it!,69
40999,GEORGE," Alright, alright!",69
41000,JERRY, That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!,69
41001,ELAINE, You flinched.,69
41002,JERRY," Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?",69
41003,ELAINE, Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.,69
41004,GEORGE," It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.",69
41005,JERRY, Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!,69
41006,GEORGE," Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car.",69
41007,KRAMER, What about the baby?,69
41008,JERRY, Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.,69
41009,ELAINE, Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches.,69
41010,JERRY, A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!,69
41011,GEORGE," Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me.",69
41012,GEORGE, I have never seen a Mohel like that.,69
41013,JERRY, That was a one in a million Mohel.,69
41014,ELAINE, I said I'm sorry.,69
41015,JERRY, Look at this.,69
41016,KRAMER, Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later.,69
41017,GEORGE," Wha, where is he going?",69
41018,JERRY, Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.,69
41019,MOHEL,  The circumcision was perfect. The finger was your fault! You flinched!,69
41020,JERRY," Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?",69
41021,MOHEL,  Ya See! He flinched again!,69
41022,JERRY," Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!",69
41023,MOHEL, One more peep out of you and I'll slice you up like a smoked sturgeon.,69
41024,JERRY," Oh don't threaten me, Butcher Boy.",69
41025,MOHEL, Butcher Boy?!,69
41026,JERRY, Ya what was this? ,69
41027,MOHEL, What was this? ,69
41028,JERRY, It was not!,69
41029,ELAINE," Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!",69
41030,STAN,"  Hey, hey what's going on out here? You two should be ashamed of yourselves, both of ya!",69
41031,MOHEL," Ah, blood.",69
41032,ELAINE," Oh, how's the baby?",69
41033,STAN, There's nothing wrong with the baby.,69
41034,MYRA, The circumcision went fine.,69
41035,MOHEL, Thank god the flincher didn't harm the baby.,69
41036,STAN, Amen.,69
41037,MOHEL," I will get you for this. This is my business, this is my life. No one ruins this for me. No one!  Here's my card.",69
41038,KRAMER,  Outta My Way!,69
41039,JERRY,"  I can't do it.  Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.",69
41040,ELAINE, You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.,69
41041,JERRY,"  Oh, that's the Flicks.",69
41042,GEORGE,"  It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion..  looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you.  So any word from the ""pig-man""?",69
41043,KRAMER, No.,69
41044,GEORGE, No. And he's not a pig-man is he?,69
41045,KRAMER," NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient.",69
41046,JERRY," Myra, Stan.",69
41047,MYRA, Don't touch him,69
41048,JERRY, What's the matter?,69
41049,STAN," You're out, Jerry. You're out as Godfather. You too, Elaine. You're both out.",69
41050,ELAINE, But I didn't do anything.,69
41051,STAN," No, no buts. We made up our minds.  We want Kramer. He showed us how much he cares about Steven.",69
41052,KRAMER,  Don't ever go against the family Jerry.,69
41053,STAN,  Godfather.,69
41054,MYRA,  Godfather.,69
41055,KRAMER, Yes,69
41056,JERRY," Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. ""That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."" ",70
41057,JERRY, Are these seats unbelievable or what? ,70
41058,GEORGE, Where's the sunblock? ,70
41059,JERRY, Here. ,70
41060,GEORGE, 25? You don't have anything higher? ,70
41061,JERRY," What, are you on Mercury? ",70
41062,GEORGE," I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free. ",70
41063,JERRY, You got a problem with paba? ,70
41064,GEORGE," Yes, I have a problem with paba. ",70
41065,JERRY, You don't even know what paba is. ,70
41066,GEORGE, I know enough to stay away from it. ,70
41067,ANNOUNCER, 30-Love,70
41068,GEORGE, So are you going to Todd's party this weekend? ,70
41069,JERRY, I'll go if someone else drives. You going? ,70
41070,GEORGE, Gwen really wants to go. ,70
41071,JERRY, You're bringing a date to a party? ,70
41072,GEORGE, No good? ,70
41073,JERRY," A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate.  Ho, ho, ho. ",70
41074,GEORGE, Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to? ,70
41075,JERRY," Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy. ",70
41076,GEORGE," Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated. ",70
41077,JERRY, That woman is absolutely stunning. ,70
41078,GEORGE," Who, the Croat? [the tennis player] ",70
41079,JERRY," Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen. ",70
41080,GEORGE," Yeah, she's a B.L. ",70
41081,JERRY, B.L.? ,70
41082,GEORGE, Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry?  Jerry? ,70
41083,COWORKER," You know, I just heard the Lexington line is out. ",70
41084,ELAINE,"  Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting? ",70
41085,COWORKER, Take a car service. We have an account. ,70
41086,ELAINE," Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage. ",70
41087,COWORKER," Well you're not going to get a cab now. Four thirty in the afternoon? Read a magazine, keep your head down. ",70
41088,ELAINE," Yea, I guess that could work. ",70
41089,ANNOUNCER," And that is it. The match to Ms. Natalia Valdoni. Coming up next, mens single, but for now let's stop a minute and take a look at our beautiful tennis center backdrop. ",70
41090,KRAMER," Hey, hey, it's George. ",70
41091,ANNOUNCER, Holy cow it's a scorcher. Boy I bet you that guy can cover a lot of court. ,70
41092,DRIVER," Dag Gavershole Plaza huh?  Pendant Publishing, that's books right?  Miss? ",70
41093,ELAINE, Pardon me? ,70
41094,DRIVER," Books, that's what you do? ",70
41095,ELAINE, Yeah. ,70
41096,DRIVER," Yeah, I don't read much myself,  well you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax, not me. You know what I do? ",70
41097,ELAINE," You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So... ",70
41098,DRIVER,  I said you know what I do  when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey uh do you make a book of Jumbles? ,70
41099,ELAINE, I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf. ,70
41100,DRIVER, Going deaf? ,70
41101,ELAINE, What? ,70
41102,DRIVER, Oh I-I-I'm sorry. ,70
41103,ELAINE, It can be very frustrating. ,70
41104,DRIVER, Hey what about a hearing aid? ,70
41105,ELAINE," Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life. ",70
41106,DRIVER," No, no I said. Ehhh, forget it.  ",70
41107,JERRY, I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing. ,70
41108,GEORGE, Boy you are really smitten. ,70
41109,JERRY, I gotta talk to her. What do you think? ,70
41110,GEORGE, Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys. ,70
41111,JERRY, I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals. ,70
41112,GEORGE, They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side. ,70
41113,JERRY, I have to. I won't be able to live with myself. ,70
41114,GEORGE," Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you. ",70
41115,JERRY, I can't. ,70
41116,GEORGE, What are you going to say? ,70
41117,JERRY," I don't know, ""Hi"". ",70
41118,GEORGE,"  You think you're going to the other side with ""Hi""? You're not going to make it. ",70
41119,RADIO, Base to 92 come in ,70
41120,DRIVER, Yes this is 92 ,70

41126,ELAINE,  Yeah. Yes it does... ,70
41127,DRIVER, Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole thing up. ,70
41128,ELAINE," No no, no no. ",70
41129,DRIVER," Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted by your behavior. ",70
41130,JERRY," Excuse me.  Excuse me?  Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you  oh well, what are you deaf? ",70
41131,LAURA, Bingo. ,70
41132,KRAMER, And you're saying she's deaf. ,70
41133,JERRY," I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf. ",70
41134,KRAMER, Can't hear a thing. ,70
41135,JERRY, Can't hear a thing. ,70
41136,KRAMER, And you're going to go out with her. ,70
41137,JERRY," Yeah, isn't that something? ",70
41138,ELAINE, Hey. ,70
41139,KRAMER, Hey I know how to sign. ,70
41140,JERRY, Really? ,70
41141,KRAMER," Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year.  So I haven't been able to do it in a while. ",70
41142,ELAINE, What is this about? ,70
41143,JERRY, I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match. ,70
41144,ELAINE," You are kidding. That is amazing.  I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf. ",70
41145,JERRY, Wow good plan. ,70
41146,ELAINE," Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person. ",70
41147,ELAINE," No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say ""get out of here"". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people. ",70
41148,JERRY, That's nice. ,70
41149,ELAINE," Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable. ",70
41150,JERRY,  That's nice for the freaks. ,70
41151,ELAINE," Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do? ",70
41152,JERRY," Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency. ",70
41153,KRAMER," Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something. ",70
41154,ELAINE, Really?,70
41155,KRAMER, Like a rock concert. Whatever you like. ,70
41156,ELAINE," Oh great, thanks Kramer. ",70
41157,KRAMER," You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that. ",70
41158,JERRY," Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men. ",70
41159,ELAINE, Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man. ,70
41160,KRAMER, Well there ought to be ball men. ,70
41161,JERRY," All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier.  Hey.",70
41162,ELAINE, Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday. ,70
41163,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's...  ",70
41164,GWEN, I'm sorry George. ,70
41165,GEORGE, I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened. ,70
41166,GWEN," It's not you, it's me. ",70
41167,GEORGE," You're giving me the ""it's not you, it's me"" routine? I invented ""it's not you, it's me"". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me. ",70
41168,GWEN," All right, George, it's you. ",70
41169,GEORGE, You're *damn* right it's me. ,70
41170,GWEN, I was just trying to... ,70
41171,GEORGE, I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me. ,70
41172,GWEN, I'm sure you do it very well. ,70
41173,GEORGE, Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out. ,70
41174,JERRY, But I thought things were going great. ,70
41175,GEORGE, Yeah so did I. ,70
41176,JERRY, Did she say why? ,70
41177,GEORGE," No. She tried to give me the ""it's not you, it's me"" routine. ",70
41178,JERRY, But that's your routine. ,70
41179,GEORGE, Yeah. Well aparently word's out. ,70
41180,KRAMER," Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday. ",70
41181,GEORGE, Really? At the tennis match? ,70
41182,KRAMER, Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. ,70
41183,GEORGE, Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there. ,70
41184,KRAMER," Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you. ",70
41185,GEORGE, Cracks? What were they saying? ,70
41186,KRAMER, That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked. ,70
41187,GEORGE," Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it. ",70
41188,KRAMER, Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight. ,70
41189,GEORGE, She must have seen me eating it on TV. ,70
41190,JERRY, So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial? ,70
41191,GEORGE, Why not. I would be. ,70
41192,JERRY," Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye. ",70
41193,GEORGE, You're parents saw me on TV? ,70
41194,JERRY, Yeah. ,70
41195,GEORGE, This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on? ,70
41196,KRAMER, It felt like 8 seconds. ,70
41197,GEORGE," One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand. ",70
41198,ELAINE, I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it? ,70
41199,GEORGE, Can we move on? ,70
41200,JERRY, He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV. ,70
41201,ELAINE, Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her. ,70
41202,GEORGE, Yes I do. ,70
41203,ELAINE, So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday. ,70
41204,GEORGE," Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there. ",70
41205,KRAMER, Well she should be the one that shouldn't go. ,70
41206,JERRY," Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette? ",70
41207,KRAMER, Excellent question. ,70
41208,JERRY," I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life. ",70
41209,ELAINE, I beg to differ. ,70
41210,JERRY, Really. ,70
41211,ELAINE, He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils. ,70
41212,JERRY," Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night. ",70
41213,ELAINE, Well we can take the car service from my office. ,70
41214,JERRY, Really? ,70
41215,ELAINE," Yeah, they don't know. ",70
41216,KRAMER," All right, I'll see you later. ",70
41217,JERRY, Okay. ,70
41218,KRAMER,  Hey Georgie.,70
41219,GEORGE," ""To the victor goes the spoils."" What are you going to do tonight? ",70
41220,JERRY, Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman. ,70
41221,GEORGE, Oh.  ,70
41222,JERRY, Why?  Well what are you doing? ,70
41223,GEORGE, Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything. ,70
41224,JERRY," Oh, uh, do you want to come with us? ",70
41225,GEORGE," Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh,  where would we be going? ",70
41226,GEORGE," So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship. ",70
41227,LAURA, They never have napkins there. ,70
41228,JERRY, Let's get the check.  Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check? ,70
41229,LAURA,  Yea.,70
41230,JERRY," Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign. ",70
41231,LAURA," Uh, oh. That couple is breaking up. ",70
41232,GEORGE, They're breaking up? How do you know? ,70
41233,JERRY, She reads lips. ,70
41234,GEORGE, What are they saying now? ,70
41235,LAURA," ""It's not you, it's me."" ",70
41236,GEORGE,"  Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me. ",70
41237,JERRY,  What? ,70
41238,GEORGE,"  We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me. ",70
41239,JERRY,"  She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas. ",70
41240,GEORGE,"  Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off. ",70
41241,JERRY,  I don't know George. I'm not sure about this. ,70
41242,GEORGE,"  Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed. ",70
41243,JERRY,  All right. ,70
41244,JERRY," Uh Laura, George was wondering if... ",70
41245,LAURA, Sure. I'll do it. ,70
41246,JERRY, So I really had a good time. ,70
41247,LAURA," Yeah, me too. ",70
41248,JERRY, So you want to go to the party on Friday night? ,70
41249,LAURA, Yeah. ,70
41250,JERRY," All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? . Six is good. . You got a problem with six? . What? What? ",70
41251,MAN," Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've only got two spots to fill. Good luck. ",70
41252,BOY,"  Hey pops, isn't there a better way to spend your twilight years? ",70
41253,KRAMER," I may be old, but I'm spry. ",70
41254,BOY, The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours. Are you up for it? ,70
41255,KRAMER, Oh I'll be up for it punk. ,70
41256,JERRY," See I was saying ""six"" but she thought I was saying ""sex"". We straightened the whole thing out though. ",70
41257,GEORGE," She confused ""six"" with ""sex""? ",70
41258,JERRY, Yeah. ,70
41259,GEORGE," Well if she can't tell ""six"" from ""sex"" then how is she going to lip read from across the room? ",70
41260,JERRY," Well ""six"" and ""sex"" are close. ",70
41261,GEORGE," It's two completely different sounds. ""ih"" and ""eh"". ",70
41262,JERRY, Eh. ,70
41263,GEORGE, It seems like a problem. ,70
41264,JERRY, Well I'm not dating any other deaf women. ,70
41265,KRAMER, Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals. ,70
41266,JERRY, You're kidding. ,70
41267,KRAMER, Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto. ,70
41268,GEORGE," Oh, when is that car service coming? ",70
41269,JERRY," In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there. ",70
41270,GEORGE, If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend. ,70
41271,JERRY, I know. It's like X-ray vision. ,70
41272,GEORGE," If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us. ",70
41273,NEWMAN," Hey, hey, hey.  I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day. ",70
41274,JERRY, Can't do it Newman. ,70
41275,NEWMAN," But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours. ",70
41276,JERRY, It's not going to happen. ,70
41277,NEWMAN,"  All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information. ",70
41278,JERRY, Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign. ,70
41279,DRIVER,  Pardon me sir? ,70
41280,JERRY, I said pull over by the stop sign. ,70
41281,DRIVER," I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. Metalla-something. ",70
41282,KRAMER, -ca. ,70
41283,DRIVER, Huh? ,70
41284,GEORGE, What? ,70
41285,JERRY, ca. ,70
41286,GEORGE, ah. ,70
41287,DRIVER, My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke. ,70
41288,DRIVER, Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door. ,70
41289,JERRY, You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night. ,70
41290,JERRY," I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs,  check, and  late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man. ",70
41291,LAURA, Congratulations.,70
41292,KRAMER, She doesn't know what she's talking about. ,70
41293,TODD, Guys you made it. ,70
41294,GEORGE, Hey hey.,70
41295,TODD,  Hey buddy.,70
41296,JERRY, Hey Todd.,70
41297,TODD, Sorry to hear about Gwen. ,70
41298,GEORGE, Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me? ,70
41299,TODD, Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk to her. ,70
41300,GEORGE, Really?,70
41301,TODD," Look George, I'm friends with both of you. But I can't betray her confidence by telling you anything. ",70
41302,GEORGE," I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything. ",70
41303,TODD, You are so centered. ,70
41304,GEORGE," Hey, grown-up.  Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead.  Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying? ",70
41305,KRAMER," ""Hi Gwen, hi tide."" ",70
41306,JERRY, Hi tide? ,70
41307,KRAMER, Hi Todd. ,70
41308,KRAMER," ""You've got something between your teeth"" ",70
41309,GEORGE, Wheret? ,70
41310,KRAMER," No that's what he said. ""That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup."" So do I. ",70
41311,ELAINE, She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon? ,70
41312,JERRY, No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody. ,70
41313,GWEN, I don't envy you Todd. The place is going to be a mess. ,70
41314,TODD, Well maybe you can stick around after everybody leaves and we can sweep together. ,70
41315,KRAMER," ""Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."" ",70
41316,GEORGE, What? ,70
41317,KRAMER," ""You want me to sleep with you?"" ",70
41318,TODD, I don't want to sweep alone. ,70
41319,KRAMER," He says ""I don't want to sleep alone."" She says, oh boy, ""love to."" ",70
41320,GEORGE, Alright that's it.  So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together? ,70
41321,GWEN, What? You're crazy. ,70
41322,KRAMER," ""What? You're crazy."" ",70
41323,GEORGE, I heard your whole conversation. ,70
41324,GWEN, How? ,70
41325,KRAMER," ""How?"" ",70
41326,GEORGE,  I can read lips. You said let's sleep together. ,70
41327,GWEN," No I didn't. I said ""sweep"". Let's sweep together, you know with a broom. Cleaning up. ",70
41328,KRAMER," ""... with a broom, cleaning up."" ",70
41329,GEORGE, Sweep? ,70
41330,GWEN, Yes sweep. ,70
41331,KRAMER," ""Yes sweep."" ",70
41332,GEORGE, Cut it. ,70
41333,KRAMER," George says ""Cut it."" ",70
41334,GEORGE, Cut it. ,70
41335,KRAMER," George is saying ""Cut it."" ",70
41336,GEORGE, Cut it.   Would you stop signing? ,70
41337,KRAMER, What?,70
41338,GEORGE," She said ""sweep together"" you idiots, not ""sleep together."" ",70
41339,KRAMER, I know how to sign. ,70
41340,GEORGE," Ow. My eye, my eye. ",70
41341,ELAINE, It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals. ,70
41342,JERRY, I know and on the first tournament of her comeback. ,70
41343,JERRY, Thus ends the great ball man experiment. ,70
41344,DRIVER,  You with the tennis center? ,70
41345,LAURA, Yep. ,70
41346,DRIVER, Hey how about that ball man injuring Monica Seles. Wasn't that something. ,70
41347,LAURA, I'm deaf. ,70
41348,DRIVER, Oh.  ,70
41349,JERRY," I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know  Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, ""Do you want the check?"" No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people. ",70
41350,JERRY,"I had glasses when I was ten years old and anybody beat that? Did anyone get them younger than that?  Seven? Two? Anybody born with glasses? Actually come out of the birth canal and go  'that was a hell of a delivery, I'll tell ya that.  Can I clean these?  Does anybody have one of those little clothes? I jus...I was just born they...they're a little smudgy.",71

41362,ELAINE, Hmm! Rico!,71
41363,JERRY, Suave! And it's non-fat!,71

41411,JERRY, How did you know?,71
41412,KRAMER," Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.",71
41413,JERRY,  Yeah?,71
41414,ELAINE,  Buzz me.,71
41415,JERRY," Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.",71
41416,KRAMER," Yeah, but did you tape it?",71
41417,JERRY,"  Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?",71
41418,KRAMER, Yes!,71
41419,JERRY," I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.",71
41420,ELAINE, Hey!,71
41421,KRAMER, Hey!,71
41422,JERRY, What's the matter?,71
41423,ELAINE," Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.",71
41424,JERRY," Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.",71
41425,KRAMER,  Yowm!,71
41426,ELAINE, What?,71
41427,KRAMER," Well, you're getting heavy.",71
41428,ELAINE,  What?,71
41429,KRAMER," Yeah, you look like you put on  five,  ten pounds.",71
41430,JERRY, Kramer!,71
41431,KRAMER," I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.",71
41432,JERRY, Me?,71
41433,KRAMER, Yeah.,71
41434,JERRY, No.,71
41435,ELAINE," Where's your bathroom scale?  Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.",71
41436,JERRY, I've gained eight.,71
41437,KRAMER, I told ya.,71
41438,ELAINE," Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?",71
41439,JERRY, How did I gain eight?,71
41440,ELAINE," I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.",71
41441,JERRY," Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.",71
41442,KRAMER," No, no, no. That's hundred percent non-fat.",71
41443,JERRY," Well, how else could this have happened?",71
41444,KRAMER," Well, maybe it's the Oreos.",71
41445,ELAINE, I don't eat Oreos.,71
41446,KRAMER, You don't eat Oreos?  The way you break them open? You're  ~ practically having sex with them.,71
41447,JERRY, What about me?,71
41448,KRAMER, You? You're getting old.,71
41449,JERRY, Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.,71
41450,KRAMER," Oh, guess again, Tubby!",71
41451,ELAINE," Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.",71
41452,JERRY, There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.,71
41453,ELAINE, AH! I've got it.,71
41454,KRAMER, What?,71
41455,ELAINE, I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.,71
41456,KRAMER," Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubs, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week.",71
41457,JERRY," Well, let's start the insanity.",71
41458,KRAMER, NNNN-Giddy-up!,71
41459,FRANK, Tommy Tune is a very good dancer.  You ever see Tommy Tune dance?,71
41460,GEORGE, No.,71
41461,ESTELLE, I like tap dancing.,71
41462,FRANK, Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.,71
41463,ESTELLE," Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.",71
41464,GEORGE, What's for supper?,71
41465,ESTELLE, Somebody's at the door.,71
41466,FRANK, Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier.,71
41467,ESTELLE,  Lloyd?,71
41468,LLOYD," Hello, Mrs. Costanza.",71
41469,ESTELLE," Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here.",71
41470,FRANK, Hey! Lloyd!,71
41471,ESTELLE, What are you doing here?,71
41472,LLOYD," Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother so I thought I'd drop by and say, ""Hello"".",71
41473,ESTELLE, Georgie. Come here and say hello.,71
41474,FRANK," How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for Dinkins now.",71
41475,LLOYD," That's right. Hey, George.",71
41476,GEORGE," Hey, Lloyd.  How's it going? ",71
41477,LLOYD, I uh ran into George yesterday in the city.,71
41478,ESTELLE, Ow!  What's the matter with you?,71
41479,LLOYD," So, uh, how's the arm, huh?",71
41480,GEORGE," Oh, it's good.",71
41481,ESTELLE, What's the matter with your arm?,71
41482,GEORGE, Nothing.,71
41483,LLOYD," Oh, his arm moves like this. ",71
41484,FRANK, Your arm moves like this? ,71
41485,GEORGE, Yeah.,71
41486,FRANK,  I never seen your arm move like this.,71
41487,ESTELLE," Me, either.",71
41488,GEORGE," Well, it comes and goes.",71
41489,FRANK, It's like some kind of aaaaa  spasm.,71
41490,LLOYD," Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists, and he said he had the best.  So, I made an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter.",71
41491,ESTELLE, Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?,71
41492,FRANK, You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You discussed George with the mayor of New York?,71
41493,ESTELLE, Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.,71
41494,GEORGE," You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor  there's really nothing they can do.",71
41495,FRANK,"  Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him?",71
41496,GEORGE, All right. All right! I'll go.,71
41497,LLOYD," Well, that's great.  And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis.",71
41498,ELAINE," Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right.  Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.",71
41499,JERRY, And they said they can do it?,71
41500,ELAINE," Yeah, it's forty-five bucks.",71
41501,JERRY," All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.",71
41502,ELAINE, Hm-hmm.,71
41503,MARYEDITH," Well, I hope you're satisfied.",71
41504,JERRY, What?,71
41505,MARYEDITH," Every word out of my son's mouth now is *beep*, *beep*, *beep*.  You know what he said to me five minutes ago? Where's my *beep*ing cupcake?",71
41506,JERRY," Gee, I'm really sorry.",71
41507,MARYEDITH, He wants to be like you because you're a comedian. Maybe you could talk to him?,71
41508,JERRY, I'd be happy to.,71
41509,MARYEDITH, Thank you.,71
41510,JERRY," Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?",71
41511,MARYEDITH, No *beep*ing way!,71
41512,LLOYD," Well, it was very nice seeing you again.",71
41513,ESTELLE," Oh, it was good seeing you.",71
41514,LLOYD," Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw you with the other day?",71
41515,GEORGE," Oh, uh, just a friend of mine.",71
41516,ESTELLE, You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?,71
41517,LLOYD, She is. She is. How about giving me her number?,71
41518,GEORGE," Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.",71
41519,ESTELLE, She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine Benes.,71
41520,LLOYD," Oh, great.  Thanks a lot!",71
41521,GEORGE, Yeah!,71
41522,LLOYD, Buh bye.,71
41523,ESTELLE," Bye!  Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?",71
41524,NEWMAN," Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, ""Nice try, granny!"" And I sent her to the back of the line!",71
41525,JERRY," Hello, Newman.",71
41526,NEWMAN," Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!",71
41527,OWNER," Hey, Seinfeld. I'd appreciate it if you'd stop using obscenities around my son, huh?",71
41528,JERRY, It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.,71
41529,ELAINE," I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?",71
41530,OWNER, That's right.,71
41531,ELAINE," 'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.",71
41532,OWNER," Yeah, well, there is no fat.",71
41533,NEWMAN," Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.",71
41534,ELAINE," Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!",71
41535,JERRY, How's it doing?,71
41536,ELAINE, Not so good.,71
41537,KRAMER," Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.",71
41538,JERRY, So what.,71
41539,KRAMER, It changes the molecules.,71
41540,JERRY," Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.",71
41541,KRAMER," Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.",71
41542,JERRY, You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.,71
41543,ELAINE," Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.",71
41544,LAB TECHNICIAN," Oh, right. Would you fill this out, please?",71
41545,ELAINE," Uh, does it matter if it's melted?",71
41546,LAB TECHNICIAN," No!  You know, this is going to take a couple of days.",71
41547,ELAINE, That's okay.,71
41548,KRAMER," Hello, there.",71
41549,CHERYL, Hello!,71
41550,KRAMER, Ooh! Test tubes. Cool!,71
41551,JERRY, What do you got there?,71
41552,LAB TECHNICIAN," Actually, this is Mr. Giuliani's blood. We're doing a cholesterol work up on it.",71
41553,JERRY, Oh.,71
41554,ELAINE," Okay, I'm done.",71
41555,CHERYL, It was really nice meeting you.,71
41556,KRAMER," Well, the pleasure's all mine.",71
41557,JERRY, You can't take that chemist out.,71
41558,KRAMER, Why not?,71
41559,JERRY, Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.,71
41560,KRAMER, I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.,71
41561,JERRY," Well, I think the whole thing stinks.",71
41562,ELAINE, It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.,71
41563,JERRY, That's enough.,71
41564,ELAINE, What?,71
41565,JERRY, With the smelling.,71
41566,GEORGE," So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.",71
41567,JERRY, Uh-huh.,71
41568,GEORGE," And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.",71
41569,JERRY," Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this?  He's gonna think you're a mental patient.",71
41570,GEORGE," I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me.  My whole life is a lie.",71
41571,ELAINE, Hey!,71
41572,GEORGE, Hey,71
41573,JERRY, Hey.,71
41574,ELAINE," So, guess who called me.",71
41575,GEORGE," Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?",71
41576,ELAINE, We're going out tomorrow night.,71
41577,GEORGE," Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.",71
41578,ELAINE, I can't say that.,71
41579,GEORGE, Why not?,71
41580,ELAINE, What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?,71
41581,GEORGE," So, you're taking his side?",71
41582,ELAINE, No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.,71
41583,GEORGE, Already you're marrying this guy?,71
41584,ELAINE, You never know.,71
41585,GEORGE," All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.",71
41586,ELAINE," All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this?  Even you can't keep that up.",71
41587,JERRY," No, I believe he can.",71
41588,MARYEDITH, Hi!,71
41589,JERRY, Hi!,71
41590,MARYEDITH, You know Jerry.,71
41591,MATTHEW," Of course, he's the funny *beep*.",71
41592,MARYEDITH, See!,71
41593,JERRY," Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.",71
41594,MATTHEW, You did it.,71
41595,JERRY," That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up.  Excuse me one second.",71
41596,ELAINE," You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.",71
41597,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. Big advisor.",71
41598,ELAINE, He tells him which soap to use.,71
41599,JERRY,  What the *beep* are you doing? You little piece of *beep*!,71
41600,CHERYL, Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.,71
41601,KRAMER, Where's the lights. Whoa!,71
41602,CHERYL, How about this?,71
41603,KRAMER, Yeah! Bunsen burner.  oo ya ya.,71
41604,CHERYL, Oo.,71
41605,KRAMER, Yaow.,71
41606,CHERYL, Ha hea.,71
41607,KRAMER, You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.,71
41608,CHERYL, It's delicious.,71
41609,KRAMER, I hear you.,71
41610,CHERYL, Non-fat?,71
41611,KRAMER," Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?",71
41612,CHERYL, No.,71
41613,KRAMER," Well, this is in case there's a tie!",71
41614,ELAINE," Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this involuntarily movement. Some sort of a  spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?",71
41615,LLOYD," Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire.",71
41616,ELAINE, Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.,71
41617,LLOYD," Name tags, hmm?",71
41618,ELAINE," Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.",71
41619,LLOYD, Maybe I'll mention that to him.,71
41620,ELAINE, Really? Wow.,71
41621,LLOYD, You sure you don't want any yogurt?,71
41622,ELAINE," No, I'm watching my weight.",71
41623,LLOYD," Well, it's non-fat.",71
41624,ELAINE," Yeah, so they say.",71
41625,LLOYD," Well I'm done, should we go?",71
41626,ELAINE, Yeah. Okay.,71
41627,ELAINE," Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.",71
41628,JERRY,  He said that?,71
41629,ELAINE,"  No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, ""Boy, you're a lot of woman!""",71
41630,KRAMER," Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?",71
41631,JERRY," No, but I expect to hear anytime.",71
41632,KRAMER," Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.",71
41633,JERRY, Why do you say that?,71
41634,KRAMER," No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?",71
41635,ELAINE, No. What about him?,71
41636,KRAMER, You didn't hear?,71
41637,ELAINE, Un-huh.,71
41638,KRAMER, He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.,71
41639,JERRY, Name tags?,71
41640,KRAMER," Yeah! So people can go around saying ""hello"" to one another.",71
41641,JERRY," Oh, I see. So you can go, ""Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!""",71
41642,KRAMER, He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election.  Name tags!,71
41643,JERRY,"  Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye.  Well, the yogurt verdict is in.  Fat!",71
41644,KRAMER, Yeow!,71
41645,GEORGE," The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this.  I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise,  oh.",71
41646,DOCTOR," Uh huh. Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.",71
41647,GEORGE," Please, doctor.",71
41648,DOCTOR, I've examined you.,71
41649,GEORGE, Yes.,71
41650,DOCTOR, I've looked at your X-rays.,71
41651,GEORGE, Uh-huh.,71
41652,DOCTOR, And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.,71
41653,GEORGE, Hmm. Really? Nothing?,71
41654,DOCTOR," Nothing, that would indicate involuntary spasms.",71
41655,GEORGE," Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?",71
41656,DOCTOR," No, not really.",71
41657,GEORGE, How so?,71
41658,DOCTOR, May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?,71
41659,GEORGE," Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?",71
41660,DOCTOR, I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye.,71
41661,GEORGE," Now, see here, doctor.",71
41662,DOCTOR," I said, good-bye.",71
41663,GEORGE, Fine.  Ow!,71
41664,ELAINE," Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.",71
41665,JERRY," Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second,  Kramer, turn that up.",71
41666,KRAMER," Huh, Okay.",71
41667,NEWS," Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, received some startling news today, when his cholesterol count turned out to be a whopping 375. What effect this will have on the minds of the voters remains to be seen. In another development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor, Lloyd Braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name tag fiasco. We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy Giuliani is about to make a statement.",71
41668,GIULIANI," It's hard to understand. Because I've been doing everything I normally do. I've been watching my diet very carefully. I exercise regularly. My only indulgence, I guess, would be that I eat a lot of frozen yogurt. But it's non-fat.",71
41669,JERRY," Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.",71
41670,ELAINE,  Now look what you've done.,71
41671,JERRY," Well, we've got to do something.  I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.",71
41672,GEORGE, Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.,71
41673,FRANK," I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. ""Hello, Sam."" ""How are you doing, Joe?""  Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away.",71
41674,GEORGE, I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An  aaaa . . .,71
41675,ESTELLE, Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.,71
41676,GIULIANI," My campaign staff has received some very disturbing information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's being sold throughout the city. I pledge to you now, that if I'm elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint a special task force to investigate this matter. I promise you, my fellow New Yorkers, that Mayor Giuliani will do everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified non-fat yogurt.",71
41677,JERRY," The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.",71
41678,GEORGE, Phew!,71
41679,ELAINE," Oh, it stinks.",71
41680,KRAMER," Mine, too. I got one more day.",71
41681,JERRY, I can't eat this.,71
41682,NEWMAN,"  Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.",71
41683,JERRY," It had fat in it, it's not good for you.",71
41684,NEWMAN," I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.",71
41685,ELAINE," Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this.  Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.",71
41686,JERRY," So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.",71
41687,ELAINE, I wonder what actually happened in that lab.,71
41688,KRAMER," Yeah, me, too.",71
41689,NEWMAN, I can't eat this.,71
41690,MATTHEW,"  Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat *beep*.",71
41691,JERRY,"JERRY: The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go ""how do you like crotch?"" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly. ",72
41692,MR. TUTTLE, Well George we here at Sanalac like to think of ourselves as a fairly progressive company. We have a small but prestigious group of clients. ,72
41693,GEORGE, Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious. ,72
41694,MR. TUTTLE," That's funny George. You're very quick. I feel like I, like I don't have to explain every little thing to you. You understand everything immediately. ",72
41695,GEORGE, I enjoy understanding. ,72
41696,MR. TUTTLE, I want you to have this job. Of course... ,72
41697,SECRETARY, Mr. Zimmer is on line 2. ,72
41698,MR. TUTTLE," Thanks. I've got to take this call. Listen, I'm really glad that you came in. ",72
41699,GEORGE, I want you to have this job. Of course... ,72
41700,GEORGE, That's it. ,72
41701,JERRY, What do you mean that's it? ,72
41702,GEORGE," He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview. ",72
41703,JERRY," ""Of course"" was the last thing he said? ",72
41704,GEORGE," Maybe he was going to say ""Of course I have to check with my associates."" ",72
41705,ELAINE," ""I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."" ",72
41706,JERRY," ""I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."" ",72
41707,GEORGE, All right. ,72
41708,ELAINE, Why don't you go ahead and call him? ,72
41709,GEORGE, Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him. ,72
41710,JERRY," So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job. ",72
41711,GEORGE, And if I don't call... ,72
41712,JERRY," You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it? ",72
41713,GEORGE, Rest stop supply. ,72
41714,ELAINE, Good for you.,72
41715,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, yeah.",72
41716,GEORGE, Hey,72
41717,JERRY, Hey,72

41719,JERRY, Shower? ,72
41720,KRAMER, Haircut. ,72
41721,JERRY, Oh.,72
41722,KRAMER, I'm very happy with this.,72
41723,JERRY, Who'd you use? Gino? ,72
41724,KRAMER, Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair. ,72
41725,ELAINE, What butcher? ,72
41726,KRAMER, The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses. ,72
41727,JERRY, Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings. ,72
41728,ELAINE, You never get good haircuts. ,72
41729,KRAMER, You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself. ,72
41730,JERRY, Really? ,72
41731,ELAINE," Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction. ",72
41732,KRAMER, What bachelor auction? ,72
41733,ELAINE, Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity. ,72
41734,KRAMER, And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio. ,72
41735,JERRY, I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time. ,72
41736,KRAMER, Polio? ,72
41737,ELAINE, Will you go ahead? You need a haircut. ,72
41738,JERRY, Okay. ,72
41739,KRAMER, What are you all dressed up for? ,72
41740,GEORGE, I had a job interview. ,72
41741,KRAMER, Yeah. How'd it go? ,72
41742,GEORGE, Good. Of course... ,72
41743,ENZO, Oh Jerry. ,72
41744,JERRY, Oh hi Enzo. ,72
41745,ENZO," Oh, you've come for the haircut. ",72
41746,JERRY," No, actually I was just gonna... ",72
41747,ENZO," It's my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you're my favorite customer. You've been with me for so long. You're so loyal. ",72
41748,JERRY," Well I, if it's your day off I really...  ",72
41749,ENZO,"  Eh, what's the difference. It takes 10 minutes. Jerry, today I'm going to do something special for you. ",72
41750,JERRY, Well I don't want to take too much off. ,72
41751,ENZO," Hey who's your barber, eh? You tell the joke, I cut the hair. ",72
41752,MAN," Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had. ",72
41753,GEORGE, He massacred you. ,72
41754,JERRY, I know.,72
41755,GEORGE, You look like you're five years old. ,72
41756,JERRY, What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps. ,72
41757,GEORGE, You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship. ,72
41758,JERRY, I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by. ,72
41759,GEORGE," Well, you gotta do it. ",72
41760,JERRY," I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart. ",72
41761,KRAMER, No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo. ,72
41762,JERRY, He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there. ,72
41763,KRAMER, So what? ,72
41764,JERRY, I didn't want to hurt his feelings. ,72
41765,KRAMER, His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself. ,72
41766,JERRY, Yea but...,72
41767,KRAMER, I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will. ,72
41768,JERRY," No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that. ",72
41769,KRAMER," I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up. ",72
41770,JERRY, I don't want you to call him. ,72
41771,KRAMER," All right, geez. You're crazy. ",72
41772,GEORGE, So I still haven't heard about that job. ,72
41773,JERRY, Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that? ,72
41774,GEORGE, I have an idea. ,72
41775,JERRY, Yeah? ,72
41776,GEORGE, I show up. ,72
41777,JERRY, What do you mean you show up? ,72
41778,GEORGE," I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced. ",72
41779,JERRY, Hmm. Not bad. ,72
41780,GEORGE, What's the worst thing that could happen? ,72
41781,JERRY," Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs. ",72
41782,GEORGE," Yeah, so? ",72
41783,JERRY," Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.",72

41792,SECRETARY, He wants to know where his office is. ,72
41793,MIKE," Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down the hall there and a small one over here. You know I should ask Jack. ",72
41794,GEORGE, Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office. ,72
41795,MIKE, Really? ,72

41860,JERRY, Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor. ,72
41861,KRAMER," Yeah, so? ",72
41862,JERRY, I think he knew. ,72
41863,KRAMER, No. He doesn't know. ,72
41864,JERRY, Who do you know? He knows my hair. ,72
41865,KRAMER, Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together. ,72

41877,ENZO," See, now Newman is a good customer. ",72
41878,NEWMAN, Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it. ,72
41879,ENZO," Oh, not everybody like Newman, so loyal. ",72
41880,NEWMAN," Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special. ",72

41887,ENZO, You're going to get me a sample of Jerry's hair. ,72

41912,JERRY, What do you want? ,72
41913,NEWMAN,  Can I use your bathroom? ,72

41931,JERRY, You want something to drink? ,72
41932,NEWMAN, No. No.,72
41933,JERRY," If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber. ",72
41934,NEWMAN," Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel  ",72
41935,ENZO, Did you get it?  Oh you done good Newman. ,72

41946,JERRY, Who is it? ,72
41947,ENZO,  Enzo Manginero. ,72
41948,JERRY," Oh my god, he knows.  Go.  One second. ",72
41949,ENZO, It was you that was in Gino's apartment the other night. ,72
41950,JERRY, No I wasn't there.  ,72
41951,ENZO, Don't lie. I know it was you. I get a sample of your hair. I match them up. ,72
41952,JERRY," Sample?  Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book. ",72

41958,TUTTLE," George, I'm surprised to see you here. ",72
41959,GEORGE, You are? ,72
41960,TUTTLE, I thought you would have taken the large office. ,72
41961,GEORGE, Oh. Really. ,72
41962,TUTTLE, I guess I didn't make that clear when I hired you. So where's that Pensky file? Let's see what you've been up to all week.,72
41963,GEORGE," Ah, here it is.",72
41964,TUTTLE,   What have you been doing all week? ,72
41965,GEORGE, Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace. ,72
41966,TUTTLE, You haven't done anything with this. ,72
41967,GEORGE, Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office. ,72
41968,TUTTLE, I'm beginning to wonder if you understand anything. ,72
41969,GEORGE, You are aware that Pensky is interested in me. ,72
41970,TUTTLE,  You're not Pensky material. ,72
41971,GEORGE,"  Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle. ",72
41972,PENSKY," Gee George, I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression. What is was going to say was, now you are aware that our Board of Directors has been indicted, myself included, and we're prohibited from doing business until the investigation is completed. So obviously, we would have no use for you. ",72
41973,GEORGE, Obviously. ,72
41974,PENSKY, Yes. ,72
41975,SECRETARY,"  Excuse me, but Mr. Costanza's car is being towed. ",72
41976,KRAMER,  So when are you gonna be able to go out?,72
41977,NEWMAN,  Not for a while.,72
41978,JERRY," If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? ""Oh, he was kind of quiet."" I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes",73
41979,JERRY, No eight years isn't such a long streak. ,73
41980,ELAINE, It isn't? ,73
41981,JERRY, No I haven't vomited in thirteen years. ,73
41982,ELAINE, Get out! ,73
41983,JERRY," Not since June 29, 1980. ",73
41984,ELAINE, You remember the date? ,73
41985,JERRY," Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George",73
41986,ELAINE," Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal. ",73
41987,JERRY, No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York. ,73
41988,ELAINE," Yeah...  Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go.  ",73
41989,JOANNE," Hi, we just saw your boyfriend at a bus stop. ",73
41990,ELAINE," Oh, yeah? ",73
41991,JOANNE, Yeah. What's his name? ,73
41992,ELAINE, Joel... ,73
41993,JOANNE, Joel what? ,73
41994,ELAINE, Uh...  Rifkin. ,73
41995,MICHAEL, Rifkin? Joel Rifkin? ,73
41996,ELAINE, Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously. ,73
41997,MICHAEL, Guess you better keep on his good side. ,73
41998,ELAINE, Very funny. That's very funny. ,73
41999,JOANNE, I wouldn't sleep with my back to him if I were you. ,73
42000,ELAINE, All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough. ,73
42001,MICHAEL, Hey Elaine listen. If you smell anything decaying in the trunk of his car... ,73
42002,ELAINE,"  OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up! ",73
42003,ELAINE," The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin. ",73
42004,JERRY, But you like your Joel Rifkin. ,73
42005,ELAINE, Yeah. I just wish he has a different name. ,73
42006,JERRY, Ask him to change it. ,73
42007,ELAINE, You can't ask a person to change their name. ,73
42008,JERRY, Why not? ,73
42009,ELAINE, Would you change yours? ,73
42010,JERRY, If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld. ,73
42011,ELAINE," Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen? ",73
42012,JERRY, Yeah. Eighteen strangles. ,73
42013,KRAMER, You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted.  Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing.  ,73
42014,ELAINE, You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game. ,73
42015,KRAMER, I'll go. ,73
42016,ELAINE, O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call. ,73
42017,KRAMER, Yeah! Ooh!  ,73
42018,ELAINE, You think I should have asked George? ,73
42019,JERRY, Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen? ,73
42020,ELAINE, Karen? ,73
42021,JERRY, Risotto.  ,73
42022,ELAINE, Oh! The Risotto broad. ,73
42023,JERRY, Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight. ,73
42024,ELAINE, I tought you didn't like double dates. ,73
42025,JERRY," George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality. ",73
42026,ELAINE, I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds. ,73
42027,JERRY," He feels he's funnier, more relaxed. ",73
42028,ELAINE, And you're taking... ,73
42029,JERRY, Jody the masseuse. ,73
42030,ELAINE," Hey, did you get a massage yet? ",73
42031,JERRY, No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage? ,73
42032,ELAINE," Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates. ",73
42033,JERRY, Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex. ,73
42034,ELAINE, So what? ,73
42035,JERRY," So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato. ",73
42036,GEORGE,  So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this  low cut thing. So I said to her,73
42037,KAREN, That is so funny. ,73
42038,GEORGE,  You're listening to this? ,73
42039,JODI, Yeah. I heard you. ,73
42040,JERRY,  My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here. ,73
42041,JODI,  So what did she say? ,73
42042,GEORGE, Well nothing. I didn't actually say that.  ,73
42043,JODI, You just said that you said it. ,73
42044,GEORGE," Sweetheart, I was exaggerating. ",73
42045,KAREN, I'm learning a lot about you tonight George. I've never seen you like this. ,73
42046,JERRY,  It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here. ,73
42047,GEORGE, You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket. ,73
42048,JODI, How can you say that? My sister got a ticket last week. Are you saying she's not attractive? ,73
42049,GEORGE," Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules.  Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart. ",73
42050,JODI,  Can we go? ,73
42051,JERRY, Yeah. Let's go. ,73
42052,KAREN, So soon?  ,73
42053,JERRY, Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen. ,73
42054,KAREN, Yeah. ,73
42055,JODI, Nice meeting you Karen. ,73
42056,KAREN, Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage. ,73
42057,JODI, Oh yeah. ,73
42058,GEORGE, Jody let's do this agian real soon  ,73
42059,JODI, Yeah.  ,73
42060,JERRY, I strained my neck last night. ,73
42061,JODI," Really, how? ",73
42062,JERRY, I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work. ,73
42063,JODI, So what's the deal with your friend George? ,73
42064,JERRY, No deal. Why? ,73
42065,JODI," What was all that ""attractive women not getting tickets"" nonsense? ",73
42066,JERRY," Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality. ",73
42067,JODI, I don't know how you can hang out with that guy. ,73
42068,JERRY, Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense  ,73
42069,JODI, Did you see the way that he was eating? ,73
42070,JERRY," Yeah, he's disgusting.  ",73
42071,JODI," I have to tell you, I really don't like him. ",73
42072,JERRY," Yeah, me either.  ",73
42073,JODI, It's just I hate that type. ,73
42074,JERRY," Yeah, he's a bad seed. ",73
42075,JODI," Now you however, you, I like.  ",73
42076,JERRY, What are you doing? ,73
42077,JODI, What do you think I'm doing?  ,73
42078,GEORGE," So, what do you think? ",73
42079,KAREN, Really enjoyed it. ,73
42080,GEORGE, Jody's nice. ,73
42081,KAREN, She's very nice.  Let's discuss this later. ,73
42082,GEORGE, You think she liked me? She seemed to like me. ,73
42083,KAREN, Yeah ,73
42084,GEORGE, I was personable. Don't you think I was personable? ,73
42085,KAREN, You were extremely personable. ,73
42086,GEORGE, I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything? ,73
42087,KAREN, I didn't pick up anything. ,73
42088,GEORGE," The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face... ",73
42089,KAREN, I didn't see a face. ,73
42090,GEORGE, I tought I saw a face. ,73
42091,KAREN," Anyhow, what is the difference? ",73
42092,GEORGE, No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend. ,73
42093,KAREN," George, George, instead of talking about this, we could be... you know...  ",73
42094,GEORGE, He he he he ,73
42095,KAREN, Ah ah ah ah ,73
42096,GEORGE, So you think she likes me? ,73
42097,ELAINE,  Uhh! What are you doing? ,73
42098,JOEL, Massaging your neck. ,73
42099,ELAINE, Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging. ,73
42100,JOEL," Uh, boning up on football?  ",73
42101,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon. ",73
42102,JOEL, Deon Benes? ,73
42103,ELAINE," Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool. ",73
42104,JOEL, D-Deon Rifkin? ,73
42105,ELAINE," Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got?  Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great! ",73
42106,JOEL, Elaine! What is going on? ,73
42107,GEORGE, She stayed over? ,73
42108,JERRY, Yeah.  ,73
42109,GEORGE, The sex wasn't so good? ,73
42110,JERRY, No. The sex was fabulous. ,73
42111,GEORGE, So? ,73
42112,JERRY, I want the massage! ,73
42113,GEORGE, Did you ask her? ,73
42114,JERRY," I tried putting her hands there  but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it. ",73
42115,GEORGE, Why not? ,73
42116,JERRY, I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating. ,73
42117,GEORGE, So we had a good time... the four of us. ,73
42118,JERRY, Yeah. ,73
42119,GEORGE, We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant. ,73
42120,JERRY, Yeah. ,73
42121,GEORGE, What did Jodi say? ,73
42122,JERRY, She had a good time. ,73
42123,GEORGE, Is that it? ,73
42124,JERRY, Pretty much. ,73
42125,GEORGE," Did she say anything about, uh... ",73
42126,JERRY, What? ,73
42127,GEORGE, Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time. ,73
42128,JERRY, Yeah  ,73
42129,GEORGE, You just hesitated. ,73
42130,JERRY, I was blowing on the coffee. ,73
42131,GEORGE, She didn't like me? ,73
42132,JERRY, Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her. ,73
42133,GEORGE, So she doesn't like me? ,73
42134,JERRY, No. ,73
42135,GEORGE, She said that? ,73
42136,JERRY, Yes. ,73
42137,GEORGE, She told you she doesn't like me! ,73
42138,JERRY, Yes. ,73
42139,GEORGE, What were her exact-- ,73
42140,JERRY," ""I don't like him."" ",73
42141,GEORGE, Uh-Huh  Why didn't she like me? ,73
42142,JERRY, Not everybody likes everybody! ,73
42143,GEORGE, I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice? ,73
42144,JERRY, You were very nice! ,73
42145,GEORGE, I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister? ,73
42146,JERRY, It has nothing to do with her sister. ,73
42147,GEORGE," I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah",73
42148,GEORGE, You vomited in 1987. ,73
42149,JERRY, Oh no. That was the dry heaves. ,73
42150,JERRY, Jodi. ,73
42151,JODI," Hey, Jerry. ",73
42152,GEORGE, Ha! Ha! Hey!  ,73
42153,JERRY, What are you doing here? ,73
42154,JODI, I was giving Kramer a massage. ,73
42155,JERRY, Kramer!  ,73
42156,JODI, I got to run. I have an appointment downtown. ,73
42157,GEORGE, Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you. ,73
42158,JODI, No that's O.K. ,73
42159,GEORGE, Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way.  ,73
42160,JERRY, I'll see you tonight.  ,73
42161,KRAMER, Hey! I am looser than creamed corn! ,73
42162,JERRY, Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet! ,73
42163,KRAMER, You don't know what you're missing buddy. ,73
42164,GEORGE," No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up.  All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me. ",73
42165,JODI, You've never met.  ,73
42166,GEORGE," Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout.  ",73
42167,KRAMER,"  First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love.  Every muscles she touches just...  ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy.  ",73
42168,JERRY, So you had a good time. ,73
42169,KRAMER, Oh... yeah... ,73
42170,JERRY, Enjoyed yourself. ,73
42171,KRAMER, Very... much... ,73
42172,JERRY, All right now you listen and you listen good!  ,73
42173,KRAMER, What!  ,73
42174,JERRY, The massages are out! ,73
42175,KRAMER, Wha-- ,73
42176,JERRY, Ahh!!! They're out! ,73
42177,KRAMER, Why?! ,73
42178,JERRY," Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one. ",73
42179,KRAMER, Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out! ,73
42180,JERRY," I'm sorry, Kramer.  ",73
42181,KRAMER," Why? Why? Look, I paid for her.  ",73
42182,JERRY, Don't you ever talk about her like that! ,73
42183,KRAMER, But why? ,73
42184,JERRY, That's final!!! ,73
42185,KRAMER, Ah!!! Yahh!!! ,73
42186,ANNOUNCER," Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Giants stadium.",73
42187,ELAINE," Oh, you have photos in your wallet? ",73
42188,JOEL, Yeah. Why? Is that weird? ,73
42189,ELAINE," No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this? ",73
42190,JOEL, That's my mother. ,73
42191,ELAINE, Oh yeah. I see the resemblance. ,73
42192,JOEL," No, there's no resemblance. ",73
42193,ELAINE," Yeah, there is, right here you see-- ",73
42194,JOEL," Elaine, I was adopted. ",73
42195,ELAINE,  Oh. That's nice. ,73
42196,JOEL," Oh, the game's about to start. I wonder where your friend Kramer is. ",73
42197,KRAMER,"  Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer. ",73
42198,TICKET MAN, Here it is. I need some I.D. ,73
42199,KRAMER," Oh, yeah.  You know, I forgot my wallet. ",73
42200,TICKET MAN," Well, I can't give it to you then. ",73
42201,KRAMER, Are you kidding me? ,73
42202,TICKET MAN, I'm afraid not. ,73
42203,KRAMER," Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer. ",73
42204,TICKET MAN, I'm sorry. I need proof. ,73
42205,KRAMER," Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day. ",73
42206,TICKET MAN," Neither do I. But without I.D., I need confirmation from the person who left the ticket. ",73
42207,KRAMER, Where's a phone? ,73
42208,ANNOUNCER," Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Would Joel Rifkin report to the stadium office. Joel Rifkin...telephone.  ",73
42209,JOEL, Who would be calling me here?  ,73
42210,ELAINE,  He's not the murderer. ,73
42211,KRAMER," Oh, God. ",73
42212,JERRY, What's the matter with you? ,73
42213,KRAMER," Jerry, I need another massage! ",73
42214,JERRY, You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for? ,73
42215,KRAMER," Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving. ",73
42216,JERRY, Oh please. ,73
42217,KRAMER," And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me!  It's killing me Jerry! ",73
42218,JERRY," Well, did you get the ball? ",73
42219,KRAMER, Oh I got the ball. ,73
42220,JERRY," Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game. ",73
42221,KRAMER," Well, It's quite a thrill. ",73
42222,JERRY, Why don't you get somebody else? ,73
42223,KRAMER, Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best. ,73
42224,JERRY," Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No ""if and's or but's"". ",73
42225,KRAMER, What about my massage? ,73
42226,JERRY,  Ask Newman. ,73
42227,GEORGE, So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things? ,73
42228,KAREN, Of course. ,73
42229,GEORGE," No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table. ",73
42230,KAREN," What, do you think I've never had a massage before? ",73
42231,GEORGE," Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it! ",73
42232,KAREN," George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her. ",73
42233,GEORGE, I wanna know what I did to this woman. ,73
42234,KAREN," What, you got a little thing for her? ",73
42235,GEORGE," No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other. ",73
42236,KAREN, What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesn't like you? Does everybody in the world have to like you? ,73
42237,GEORGE, Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked! ,73
42238,ELAINE, Of course I support your decision to change your name. ,73
42239,JOEL, After the Giant game I realized that this--this problem isn't going away. ,73
42240,ELAINE," Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin. ",73
42241,JOEL, Sure? ,73
42242,ELAINE,  RRR... ,73
42243,JOEL, O.K. you got your list? ,73
42244,ELAINE, Yeah. Yeah. 10 names. ,73
42245,JOEL, Right. ,73
42246,ELAINE," O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it. ",73
42247,JOEL, O.K. ,73
42248,ELAINE, O.K. You start. What's your first choice? ,73
42249,JOEL, Stuart. ,73
42250,ELAINE,  No. Second choice. ,73
42251,JOEL, Stu--Stuart's no good? ,73
42252,ELAINE, I have never met a normal guy named Stuart. ,73
42253,JOEL, O-O.K. My second choice is... Todd. ,73
42254,ELAINE,  Todd.  No. Veto. ,73
42255,JOEL," All right. Oh, hey, I think you're gonna like my first my third choice. ",73
42256,ELAINE, Great... ,73
42257,JOEL, Alex. ,73
42258,ELAINE," I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex. ",73
42259,JOEL, Bad bad association? ,73
42260,ELAINE," Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go",73
42261,JODI, Hey. ,73
42262,JERRY, Hi. ,73
42263,JODI, Hi.  I was running late and I didn't have a chance to drop off my stuff before I came over. ,73
42264,JERRY," Ah, no problem. That's fine. ",73
42265,JODI, What's with this music? ,73
42266,JERRY," That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great!  ",73
42267,JODI, What are you doing? ,73
42268,JERRY, Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment. ,73
42269,JODI," Actually, I should get a new one. ",73
42270,JERRY," No, nonsense. This one's fine.  ",73
42271,JODI," So, where do you wanna go?  ",73
42272,JERRY," Go? Why go anywhere?  Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good.  Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice. ",73
42273,JODI,"  No. No, this isn't good. I can't do this. ",73
42274,JERRY," Why, what's wrong?  ",73
42275,JODI, I can't  ,73
42276,JERRY, No. Yes you can.  ,73
42277,JODI," No, I can't! ",73
42278,JERRY, Come on! I know it's something you wanna do!  ,73
42279,GEORGE," You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to.  I've got to. ",73
42280,KAREN, You're going now? ,73
42281,GEORGE, I think I can still catch her. ,73
42282,KAREN, All right George. I have had just about enough of this. ,73
42283,GEORGE, What? What are you talking about. ,73
42284,KAREN, I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her! ,73
42285,GEORGE, I know. I know. ,73
42286,KAREN," Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick? ",73
42287,GEORGE,"  I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me.  ",73
42288,KAREN," Well, now I hate you! ",73
42289,GEORGE, That I'm used to.  ,73
42290,JOEL, Ned? ,73
42291,ELAINE, What is wrong with Ned? ,73
42292,JOEL, Ned's a guy who buys irregular underwear. Next! ,73
42293,ELAINE, Ellis. ,73
42294,JOEL, Ellis?! You might as well go with Alex. It's the same thing! ,73
42295,ELAINE, Ellis and Alex aren't even close. ,73
42296,JOEL, NEXT! ,73
42297,ELAINE," Ohh, what is the point? ",73
42298,JOEL," NO, NO. COME ON! ",73
42299,ELAINE, O.K. O.K. Remy. ,73
42300,JOEL, Remy Rifkin? Should I get a beret? ,73
42301,ELAINE," Oh, Stuart's a lot better!  Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother. ",73
42302,JOEL, Grrrr! ,73
42303,JERRY," What do you mean, no? ",73
42304,JODI, No means no. ,73
42305,JERRY," Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser. ",73
42306,JODI," Listen. I massage who I want, when I want. I don't submit to forcible massage.  I'm getting out of here. ",73
42307,JERRY, Fine. Go. ,73
42308,GEORGE," Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please? ",73
42309,JERRY, What for? ,73
42310,GEORGE, We need to talk. ,73
42311,JERRY, You need to talk? ,73
42312,JODI, We have nothing to talk about. ,73
42313,GEORGE, Look it's no secret what's going on between us.  She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind. ,73
42314,JERRY," George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me. ",73
42315,GEORGE,  Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her. ,73
42316,JERRY, What? ,73
42317,GEORGE, She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable. ,73
42318,JERRY, I can see that. ,73
42319,JODI, I'm getting out of here.  Don't call me. ,73
42320,JERRY, Don't worry.  ,73
42321,GEORGE, A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime. ,73
42322,JERRY, You're a lucky guy. ,73
42323,GEORGE, I got to go after her. ,73
42324,JERRY, George. I wouldn't push for the massage.  ,73
42325,GEORGE, JODI!  ,73
42326,JERRY," The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go ""Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."" ",73
42327,JERRY,"JERRY: You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.' ",74
42328,JERRY, How would you describe the smell in this house? ,74
42329,ELAINE,  Dandruff? ,74
42330,JERRY," Yeah, that's part of it.  Kasha? ",74
42331,ELAINE, There's some kasha. ,74
42332,JERRY," Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really. ",74
42333,ELAINE," Alright, let's go, come on. ",74
42334,GEORGE, Wha... you're going? ,74
42335,ELAINE," Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late. ",74
42336,KRAMER, Egh. These aren't candies. ,74
42337,GEORGE, Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps!  ,74
42338,KRAMER, Well I'm a guest. ,74
42339,GEORGE, Now my parents are gonna know I had people over. ,74
42340,JERRY, You're not allowed to have people over? ,74
42341,GEORGE, I can't have any parties while they're out of town.  ,74
42342,KRAMER," What, this is a party? ",74
42343,ELAINE," Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go. ",74
42344,GEORGE,  Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table! ,74
42345,JERRY,"  I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table. ",74
42346,GEORGE," But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain!  ",74
42347,KRAMER," Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh? ",74
42348,ELAINE,  Come on! ,74
42349,JERRY, What's the big rush? ,74
42350,ELAINE, I'm having people over. ,74
42351,JERRY, Who? ,74
42352,ELAINE," The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona... ",74
42353,JERRY," Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there? ",74
42354,ELAINE, Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy. ,74
42355,JERRY,  Really? ,74
42356,ELAINE, I'll put in a good word for you. ,74
42357,JERRY," Thanks, because I would really like...  ",74
42358,GEORGE,  Aaahh!! ,74
42359,JERRY," Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  ",74
42360,GEORGE," But Jerry, this is not coming out! ",74
42361,JERRY, Just put a coffee table book over it. ,74
42362,GEORGE, My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table! ,74
42363,KRAMER," Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it? ",74
42364,ELAINE," Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George. ",74
42365,GEORGE," Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished. ",74
42366,ELAINE, Now?! ,74
42367,GEORGE," Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them! ",74
42368,ELAINE," Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven. ",74
42369,KRAMER," Alright, we'll take the subway. ",74
42370,JERRY, There you go. That'll get you home in time. ,74
42371,ELAINE, Oh! The subway? From Queens? ,74
42372,GEORGE," Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat. ",74
42373,JERRY," I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you. ",74
42374,ELAINE, I need something to read on the subway. ,74
42375,JERRY,"  Here, read this. ",74
42376,ELAINE,  TV Guide? ,74
42377,KRAMER," Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told. ",74
42378,ELAINE,  Hmm-mmm. ,74
42379,KRAMER," So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh? ",74
42380,ELAINE,  Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning. ,74
42381,KRAMER,  Yes indeed. ,74
42382,TANNOY ," Next stop, Queensboro Plaza. ",74
42383,KRAMER," Oh, Queensboro Plaza.  This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one? ",74
42384,ELAINE, How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time? ,74
42385,KRAMER," Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go.  Three dollars, no change. You want one? ",74
42386,ELAINE,  No thanks. ,74
42387,KRAMER," Alright, but no bites. ",74
42388,RICKY, Highlighter? ,74
42389,ELAINE, Excuse me? ,74
42390,RICKY, To highlight the programmes you plan to watch. ,74
42391,ELAINE," Ah. Uh, look really  I'm just trying to read. ",74
42392,RICKY," Fine, okay. It's just, I've never seen a beautiful lady reading 'the Guide' so far away from a TV. You must really like television. ",74
42393,KRAMER,  Elaine! ,74
42394,RICKY, Guess your boyfriend'll have to catch the next train. ,74
42395,ELAINE, He's not my boyfriend. ,74
42396,RICKY, He's not?  Interesting. ,74
42397,JERRY," Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something. ",74
42398,GEORGE, Why? ,74
42399,JERRY," Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me? ",74
42400,GEORGE, Can't hurt you. ,74
42401,JERRY," What about, what about this thing? ",74
42402,GEORGE, The Indian? ,74
42403,JERRY," Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute. ",74
42404,GEPETTO," Well, I can have the table ready for you on Monday. ",74
42405,GEORGE," Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back. ",74
42406,GEPETTO," They left you home alone, huh? ",74
42407,RICKY," Oh, 'kay, see. On this particular Tuesday  you could've watched six hours of Lucy. There's I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy. ",74
42408,ELAINE," Oh,  my stop.  Bye-bye. ",74
42409,RICKY,  Hey miss!  You forgot this! ,74
42410,GEPETTO," They don't make these any more. The work is, is all done by hand.  Takes years, and years, and...  Sylvia! For crying out, you're forty-five minutes late! ",74
42411,SYLVIA," Yeah, yeah.  Is that your car out there? ",74
42412,GEORGE," No, it's, it's his.  ",74
42413,SYLVIA," Oh, nice. You guys are obviously from Manhattan. ",74
42414,GEORGE," Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner. ",74
42415,SYLVIA," Really? Ah, I didn't think any cool guys lived in this neighborhood. ",74
42416,GEORGE,"  Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing. ",74
42417,JERRY," Alright, I'll take it. ",74
42418,GEPETTO, Smart choice. ,74
42419,SYLVIA," Wow, you bought the Indian? Oh, you guys have great taste. ",74
42420,GEORGE," Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them. ",74
42421,ELAINE, Knocked you out Jack. Pair of deuces ,74
42422,THE GIRLS,  Oh/Aah.,74
42423,ELAINE,"  Ha, ha, ha ha! ",74
42424,ELAINE, Who is it? ,74
42425,JERRY , It's Jerry. ,74
42426,ELAINE, Jerry! ,74
42427,JERRY, Surprise!  ,74
42428,ELAINE, What is this? ,74
42429,JERRY," Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something. ",74
42430,ELAINE," Oh, you did?  Oh, do you guys all know Jerry? ",74
42431,THE GIRLS, Hi Jerry/Hello.  ,74

42433,GIRL ," Elaine, is it your birthday? ",74
42434,ELAINE, No. ,74

42440,JERRY, It's a cigar store Indian.  Read the card. ,74
42441,ELAINE,  That's very nice. Thank you very much. ,74
42442,JERRY, Read it out loud. ,74
42443,ELAINE," I, I don't think so. ",74
42444,JERRY,  We had a little fight this afternoon.  Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe. ,74
42445,WINONA,"  Hey, you know, it's late. I really should go. ",74
42446,ELAINE," I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh... ",74
42447,JERRY," Hey-yah, ho-ah, hey-yah, ho-ah. ",74
42448,ELAINE, Are you out of your mind?! ,74
42449,JERRY," ...ho-ah. It's, it's, it's kitschy. ",74
42450,ELAINE, Winona is a Native American. ,74
42451,JERRY, She is? ,74
42452,SYLVIA, You got very unusual taste. ,74
42453,GEORGE,  I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled. ,74
42454,SYLVIA, Fine. ,74
42455,GEORGE, I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block. ,74
42456,SYLVIA,  Ahh! Is this your son in the bubble bath? ,74
42457,GEORGE,"  No, that's me. ",74
42458,SYLVIA, Oh. You don't see many guys your age who keep baby pictures of themselves around.  I like it. Consistent with the rest of the house. ,74
42459,GEORGE," Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house. ",74
42460,SYLVIA, What is this we're listening to? ,74
42461,GEORGE, The Ray Conniff Singers.  ,74
42462,SYLVIA," Mmmm, what's that smell? Kasha? ",74
42463,GEORGE," It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom?  ",74
42464,WINONA , Who is it? ,74
42465,JERRY," Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld. ",74
42466,WINONA,  Yeah? ,74
42467,JERRY," Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up? ",74
42468,WINONA, I'll come down. ,74
42469,KRAMER, I came by to get my ball. ,74
42470,ELAINE, It's right over there. ,74
42471,KRAMER," Oh, yeah, thanks.  Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh?  Yo! Where did this come from? ",74
42472,ELAINE, You want it? ,74
42473,KRAMER,  I can have this?! ,74
42474,ELAINE," Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours. ",74
42475,KRAMER, Oh. I'll lug. ,74
42476,WINONA, It's just that it's a very sensitive issue for me. ,74
42477,JERRY," And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya? ",74
42478,WINONA,  I guess I could go for a bite. ,74
42479,JERRY," You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address...  Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here. ",74
42480,MAILMAN," Why must I know? Because I'm Chinese? You think I know where all the Chinese restaurants are?  Oh, ask honorable Chinaman for location of restaurant. ",74
42481,JERRY," I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood. ",74
42482,MAILMAN," Oh, hello American Joe. Which way to hamburger, hotdog stand?  ",74
42483,JERRY, I didn't know that... ,74
42484,WINONA," You know, it's late. I should probably just go home. ",74
42485,JERRY," I, I had no idea. ",74
42486,KRAMER,  Hey Jerry!  Look what I got!  ,74
42487,GEORGE, Looks pretty good. ,74
42488,JERRY," Yeah, did a good job. ",74
42489,GEORGE, Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell. ,74
42490,JERRY," You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle. ",74
42491,GEORGE," So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh... ",74
42492,JERRY," Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight. ",74
42493,GEORGE," Oh, great. ",74
42494,JERRY," Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake. ",74
42495,GEORGE, Aw c'mon. ,74
42496,ESTELLE," Hello, hello! ",74
42497,GEORGE,"  Ahh, hey you're home. Hi. ",74

42500,FRANK, Where's the mail? ,74
42501,ESTELLE, Hello Jerry. ,74
42502,JERRY, Hello. ,74
42503,GEORGE," So, how was the trip? ",74
42504,ESTELLE," Ah, your father... ",74
42505,FRANK, Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a toll booth? ,74
42506,ESTELLE, I'm going upstairs.  ,74
42507,FRANK,"  This stack should be bigger, where's the TV Guide? ",74
42508,GEORGE, What TV Guide? ,74
42509,FRANK," I'm missing TV Guide volume forty-one, number thirty-one. ",74
42510,JERRY," Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway. ",74
42511,FRANK, Elaine took it? ,74
42512,GEORGE, I didn't know she took it! ,74
42513,JERRY," Wa, it's two weeks old. ",74
42514,FRANK,  How could you let her take the TV Guide?! ,74
42515,GEORGE,  He collects them. ,74
42516,JERRY, You collect TV Guide? ,74
42517,FRANK," The nerve of that woman. Walking into my house, stealing my collectible! ",74
42518,ESTELLE,  Oh my God!  This was in our bed. ,74
42519,FRANK,  What is this?  A prophylactic wrapper?! ,74
42520,ESTELLE, What is this doing on my bed?! ,74
42521,GEORGE," I don't know, uh... ",74
42522,JERRY, I'll see you later.  ,74
42523,FRANK, You were having sex on our bed?! ,74
42524,GEORGE, Yes! ,74
42525,ESTELLE," Who told you, you could have sex in our bed? ",74
42526,GEORGE,"  Well, my bed is too small. ",74
42527,FRANK," Your bed is too small? I'm gone two weeks and you turn our house into, into Bourbon Street! ",74
42528,ESTELLE, Where am I going to sleep? ,74
42529,GEORGE, What are you talking about? ,74
42530,ESTELLE, I can't sleep in there! ,74
42531,GEORGE, Of course you can. ,74
42532,ESTELLE, I can't!  I can't! ,74
42533,FRANK, That's it! You're grounded! ,74
42534,GEORGE,"  You can't ground me, I'm a grown man. ",74
42535,FRANK, You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house.  You're grounded! ,74
42536,WINONA," So, where are we gonna go eat? ",74
42537,JERRY, I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest. ,74
42538,WINONA," Ooh, I love that place, but it's usually so crowded. Can we get a table? ",74
42539,JERRY," Ah, don't worry. I made reser...  ",74
42540,WINONA, You made what? ,74
42541,JERRY," I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats. ",74
42542,WINONA, How did you get these? ,74
42543,JERRY," Got 'em on the street, from a scal...  ",74
42544,WINONA, From who?,74
42545,JERRY," A uh, one of those guys. ",74
42546,WINONA, What guys? ,74
42547,JERRY," You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events. ",74
42548,WINONA, Oh. ,74
42549,JERRY," Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide. ",74
42550,WINONA, That's Al Roker. ,74
42551,JERRY," Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this? ",74
42552,WINONA," Sure, take it. ",74
42553,JERRY, Thanks. ,74
42554,JERRY," So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you. ",74
42555,ELAINE," Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh? ",74
42556,JERRY, Yeah. You almost ruined his life's work. ,74
42557,ELAINE, He collects  these? ,74
42558,JERRY, Yeah. ,74
42559,ELAINE," Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him. ",74
42560,JERRY, What'ya do with the one you took? ,74
42561,ELAINE, I dunno. ,74
42562,ELAINE, Hi. ,74
42563,KRAMER," Yeah uh, Elaine uh, what'd he say? ",74
42564,ELAINE, What did who say? ,74
42565,KRAMER, Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book? ,74
42566,ELAINE, Uhmm... ,74
42567,KRAMER," Yeah, you didn't tell him didya? ",74
42568,ELAINE," Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be  totally embarrassed to bring it... ",74
42569,KRAMER,"  Wait a minute, on the cover I'm... ",74
42570,ELAINE, I would be embarrassed to bring it up. ,74
42571,JERRY," I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table. ",74
42572,KRAMER," Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster.  Alright, well I'm gonna go. ",74
42573,JERRY, Where you going? ,74
42574,KRAMER," Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian. ",74
42575,JERRY, My Indian? ,74
42576,KRAMER," You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy.  ",74
42577,FRANK, How do you just walk into a house and take a TV Guide? How does she expect you to watch TV?  Am I just supposed to turn it on and wander aimlessly around the dial? ,74
42578,RICKY, Hello. Is Elaine home? ,74
42579,ESTELLE," Elaine Benes? Oh, she's my son's friend. ",74
42580,FRANK,  And she's not welcome in this house! ,74
42581,RICKY,"  Oh, 'cos I made her this very special gift. 'Kay, it's a bouquet of paper from her TV Guide. ",74
42582,FRANK,  That's my TV Guide! Ripped to shreds! She gave that to you?! ,74
42583,RICKY,"  Hey, is that the Twilight Zone you're watching? ",74
42584,GEORGE, Yeah. ,74
42585,RICKY," Oh, this is a good one. ",74
42586,TANNOY ," Next stop, Queensboro Plaza. ",74
42587,ELAINE ," Mmm, gyro. ",74
42588,WINONA, I like your place. It's very unassuming. ,74
42589,JERRY," Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions. ",74
42590,WINONA,"  Oh, by the way. That TV Guide I gave you, I need it back. ",74
42591,JERRY, Why? ,74
42592,WINONA," Well, I'm doing a report on minorities in the media, and I wanted to use that interview with Al Roker. ",74
42593,JERRY," Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father. ",74
42594,WINONA," Jerry, I really need it back. It, it is mine. ",74
42595,JERRY," You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you...  ",74
42596,WINONA, What? ,74
42597,JERRY," A uh, a person that uh... ",74
42598,WINONA, A person that what? ,74
42599,JERRY," Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh... ",74
42600,WINONA, And? ,74
42601,JERRY," ...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to. ",74
42602,WINONA," You mean like, an Indian giver?! ",74
42603,JERRY," I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term. ",74
42604,RICKY, I like the special fall preview issues the best. ,74
42605,FRANK, Those. I've been saving those from the beginning. ,74
42606,RICKY," These are worth like, a lot of money. ",74
42607,ESTELLE," Oh, hello Elaine! ",74
42608,ELAINE, Hello.  ,74
42609,RICKY,  Elaine! Hello! You look scrumptious. ,74
42610,FRANK, Why'd you take my TV Guide? ,74
42611,ELAINE,"  I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one.  ",74
42612,RICKY, I made this for you. ,74
42613,ELAINE,"  Oh, thank you. ",74
42614,FRANK,  What is this? You got stains all over it! What the hell'd you do? ,74
42615,RICKY," Hey, you can't talk to her like that. ",74
42616,FRANK,  I'll talk to her any way I want! ,74
42617,RICKY," Come on Elaine, let's go. ",74
42618,ESTELLE, My coffee table! ,74
42619,KRAMER," I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly. ",74
42620,SPIKE, I'll give you a box of Coronas for it. ,74
42621,KRAMER, Forget it. ,74
42622,LIPPMAN," Uh, excuse me. Are you uh, selling this Indian? ",74
42623,KRAMER," Oh yeah, yeah. ",74
42624,LIPPMAN," Uh, I'm just uh, redecorating my office in a south-western motif and this'd be perfect. Give you five hundred dollars for it? ",74
42625,KRAMER, Giddyup. ,74
42626,LIPPMAN," Yeah? Could you help me bring it up to my office, I'm right next door. Pendant Publishing. ",74
42627,KRAMER, Pendant Publishing? Giddyup again. ,74
42628,ELAINE," Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh...  Kramer! ",74
42629,KRAMER," Yeah, hi Elaine. ",74
42630,ELAINE, What are you doing in here with that? ,74
42631,KRAMER," Ah, well, it's a business transaction. ",74
42632,LIPPMAN,"  Listen uh, petty cash just had tens and twenties.  Go ahead, count it. ",74
42633,KRAMER," Yeah, I'm sure it's all here.  You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall. ",74
42634,LIPPMAN," You like that, huh? I had that custom made for me in Santa Fe. ",74
42635,KRAMER, You mind if I use it in my book? ,74
42636,LIPPMAN, What book? ,74
42637,KRAMER," Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables. ",74
42638,LIPPMAN, About coffee tables? ,74
42639,KRAMER, Uh huh. ,74
42640,LIPPMAN, That's fantastic.  Who's your publisher? ,74
42641,KRAMER," Well, I'm still shopping it around. ",74
42642,LIPPMAN," Yeah?  You see, this is the kind of idea you should be coming in with. What the hell do you do round here all day anyway? ",74
42643,ELAINE, Well I  ...manuscript that I... ,74
42644,LIPPMAN,"  God, that Indian really completes the room. Don't you think? ",74
42645,SYLVIA," I know this coffee table, it's George Costanza's. ",74
42646,ESTELLE, It's mine. I'm his mother. ,74
42647,SYLVIA," Oh, I haven't seen George for a while. He must be working very hard. ",74
42648,ESTELLE, George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us. ,74
42649,SYLVIA, He does? ,74
42650,JERRY, I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide. ,74
42651,ELAINE, I dunno. ,74
42652,JERRY," Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy.  ",74
42653,ELAINE, I guess. ,74
42654,JERRY, What's the matter? ,74
42655,ELAINE, What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book. ,74
42656,JERRY," It is a good idea, Elaine. ",74
42657,TANNOY ," Next stop, Queensboro Plaza. ",74
42658,JERRY, You want a gyro? ,74
42659,ELAINE, I don't think so. ,74
42660,JERRY, Elaine! ,74
42661,AL ROKER, Guess your boyfriend's gonna have to catch the next train. ,74
42662,ELAINE, He's not my boyfriend. ,74
42663,AL ROKER, He's not? Interesting.  ,74
42664,JERRY," I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?'  'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents? ",74
42665,JERRY," You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But it’s really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesn’t it? ""I really am a doctor you know. You think I’m not, just check it out."" I don’t know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. ""Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and I’ll give you my opinion."" After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what they’re talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants. ",75
42666,GEORGE," Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable.  Ooh, a little expensive. ",75
42667,SASHA, Twenty five dollars. ,75
42668,GEORGE," Yes, well, you know, I’m not thinking about the price. You know you’re the only woman I’ve never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster. ",75
42669,SASHA," George, George, uh, I think we have to talk. I think we have a problem. ",75
42670,GEORGE, We do? ,75
42671,SASHA, We can’t keep seeing each other. ,75
42672,GEORGE, Why? ,75
42673,SASHA,"  Because it’s over.  It’s my parents George, the differences in our religion. Oh George, can you ever forgive me?  ",75
42674,WAITER," Uh, have you decided yet? ",75
42675,SASHA,  Yes. I’ll have the lobster. ,75
42676,GEORGE," Um, you know I’m starting to think that maybe lobster isn’t the way to go. ",75
42677,JERRY, Then he asked you out? ,75
42678,ELAINE," We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart. ",75
42679,JERRY, On your heart? ,75
42680,ELAINE," Jerry, the man is a doctor. ",75
42681,JERRY, Doctor? He’s a podiatrist. ,75
42682,ELAINE," So, it’s the same thing. ",75
42683,JERRY, Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school. ,75
42684,ELAINE, Really? ,75
42685,TAWNI, Hello. ,75
42686,JERRY, Oh hi. ,75
42687,TAWNI, Are you going to be stopping by later? ,75
42688,JERRY," Yes, I’ll be stopping. ",75
42689,TAWNI," Ok, see you later.",75
42690,JERRY, See you later.  Well we can’t all be dating podiatrists. ,75
42691,GEORGE, It’s over. ,75
42692,ELAINE, What? ,75
42693,JERRY, How did you get in? ,75
42694,GEORGE, Kramer. ,75
42695,ELAINE, What’s that? ,75
42696,GEORGE, Lobster. ,75
42697,JERRY, Looks like a swan. ,75
42698,GEORGE, She says we can’t go out anymore. ,75
42699,ELAINE, Why? ,75
42700,GEORGE, Because I’m not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents won’t let her get involved with anyone who isn’t Latvian Orthodox. ,75
42701,ELAINE," Latvian Orthodox?  Mmm, it is lobster. ",75
42702,JERRY, She’s limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad. ,75
42703,GEORGE, I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well that’s not entirely true. ,75
42704,JERRY," Oh, whatever.",75
42705,ELAINE," Mmm, this is delicious. ",75
42706,JERRY," Mmm, succulent. ",75
42707,GEORGE," She knew I didn’t have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didn’t seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman. ",75
42708,ELAINE, Why don’t you just ask her parents? ,75
42709,GEORGE," I can’t. I met them. They’re devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting. ",75
42710,JERRY, To Latvian Orthodox? ,75
42711,GEORGE, Why not? What do I care? ,75
42712,JERRY, You know it’s not like changing toothpaste. ,75
42713,ELAINE, I think it would be romantic. ,75
42714,GEORGE, Really? ,75
42715,ELAINE," Yeah, it’s like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh. ",75
42716,GEORGE," King Edward.  King Edward, Jerry. ",75
42717,JERRY, Yeah well King Edward didn’t live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza. ,75
42718,GEORGE, You know what? I could probably do this. What’s the difference. ,75
42719,ELAINE, George I was just kidding around. ,75
42720,GEORGE, No. I wouldn’t even have to tell her. I could surprise her. ,75
42721,ELAINE, George I wasn’t serious. ,75
42722,GEORGE," How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this. ",75
42723,ELAINE, I guess this one is my fault. ,75
42724,JERRY, Oh yeah. ,75
42725,TAWNI,  Oh that was nice. Have you always been such a good kisser? ,75
42726,JERRY," Oh I don’t know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing. ",75
42727,TAWNI, Well it was worth it.  I’ll be  right  back . Where are you going? ,75
42728,JERRY, To wash my hands. They’re sticky from the orange. ,75
42729,TAWNI, Meet you back here? ,75
42730,JERRY, Right there. ,75
42731,JERRY,"  ""Fungicide"". Fungus? ",75
42732,JERRY, Fungicide. I mean what could she have? ,75
42733,ELAINE, I don’t know. ,75
42734,KRAMER, Fungus. ,75
42735,JERRY, Exactly,75
42736,ELAINE, So what did you say? ,75
42737,JERRY, I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home. ,75
42738,ELAINE," I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet? ",75
42739,JERRY, I didn’t open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little. ,75
42740,ELAINE, You were snooping. ,75
42741,JERRY, I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldn’t do that. ,75
42742,KRAMER, I would. I always open medicine cabinets. ,75
42743,ELAINE, Well I trust people not to do that. ,75
42744,KRAMER, Big mistake. ,75
42745,JERRY, Why don’t you ask that doctor what it is? ,75
42746,ELAINE, What? Now he’s a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist. ,75
42747,JERRY, But that’s what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. They’re knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus. ,75
42748,ELAINE, I am not going to ask him about funguses. ,75
42749,KRAMER, Fungi. ,75
42750,JERRY, What? ,75
42751,KRAMER, Fungi. ,75
42752,GEORGE,"  In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um…  ",75
42753,GEORGE, No. ,75
42754,GEORGE, No not vast  ,75
42755,GEORGE, Yes. ,75
42756,GEORGE,  I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious. ,75
42757,GEORGE," Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah. ",75
42758,GEORGE," Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that. ",75
42759,GEORGE," Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in? ",75
42760,GEORGE," Ah hah. You see Father, I’m I’m incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, don’t you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change? ",75
42761,SISTER ROBERTA," Oh I’m sorry. Father, there’s a man waiting in the chapel. ",75
42762,SISTER ROBERTA, Oh are you? That’s wonderful. Well good luck to you. ,75
42763,GEORGE, Nice nun. ,75
42764,SISTER ROBERTA, May I help you? ,75
42765,KRAMER," Oh yeah, I’m here to pick up my friend George Costanza. ",75
42766,SISTER ROBERTA, Well he’s in with the Father. ,75
42767,KRAMER, Oh yeah. ,75
42768,SISTER ROBERTA, I’m Sister Roberta. ,75
42769,KRAMER, Oh. Kramer. Pleasure. ,75
42770,SISTER ROBERTA, Mine.  ,75
42771,GEORGE," I can’t believe how easy it is. I’m virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and I’m in the club. ",75
42772,JERRY, That’s all there is to it. ,75
42773,GEORGE, That’s all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza. ,75
42774,JERRY, And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza? ,75
42775,GEORGE, Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence. ,75
42776,JERRY, Oh a slinky.,75
42777,KRAMER, Sister Roberta gave it to me. ,75
42778,JERRY, Why did she give you that? ,75
42779,KRAMER, I think she liked me. ,75
42780,JERRY, What do you mean she liked you? ,75
42781,KRAMER, Liked me. ,75
42782,GEORGE," Kramer, they like everybody. They’re friendly people. ",75
42783,KRAMER, No. I think I picked up on a vibe. ,75
42784,JERRY," You picked up on a vibe, from a nun. ",75
42785,KRAMER," Yeah, Jerry I’m telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it. ",75
42786,JERRY, Yea alright. ,75
42787,KRAMER," Oh, that's my phone.",75
42788,JERRY, Oh hi. ,75
42789,TAWNI," Hi, I just wanted to stop by and see how you were feeling. ",75
42790,JERRY,  A little better.  ,75
42791,TAWNI, If you need anything let me know. ,75
42792,JERRY, Okay.,75
42793,TAWNI, Okay.,75
42794,JERRY, All right.,75
42795,TAWNI, Bye.,75
42796,JERRY, Bye.,75
42797,GEORGE, Story. ,75
42798,JERRY, She’s subletting Carol’s place for a month. ,75
42799,GEORGE," Yea, she likes you. ",75
42800,JERRY, Yeah but there’s a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet. ,75
42801,GEORGE, So? ,75
42802,JERRY, So I don’t know what she’s using it for. ,75
42803,GEORGE, Well how do you even know it’s hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube? ,75
42804,JERRY, I didn’t even think to look. ,75
42805,GEORGE, Well take a look. It might not even belong to her. ,75
42806,JERRY, Yeah. ,75
42807,GEORGE, People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet. ,75
42808,JERRY, Yeah I’ve got this old bottle of cough medicine. ,75
42809,GEORGE, I still have brill cream. ,75
42810,JERRY, Hi,75
42811,TAWNI, Hi. ,75
42812,JERRY, Hi. Can I use your bathroom? ,75
42813,ELAINE, You sure you don’t mind? ,75
42814,DOCTOR, No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time. ,75
42815,ELAINE, Well I mean the question isn’t even for me it’s for a friend. ,75
42816,DOCTOR," Elaine, I’m used to it. I’m a doctor. ",75
42817,ELAINE, Well… podiatrist. ,75
42818,DOCTOR, Huh? ,75
42819,ELAINE," No no, I’m just saying you didn’t really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which I’m sure is very grueling in it’s own way. ",75
42820,DOCTOR, I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet. ,75

42840,SISTER ROBERTA," Good evening. I hope I’m not disturbing you, but I found another toy I thought you might like. ",75
42841,JERRY," Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And I’ll need that in the form of a question. ",75
42842,GEORGE, I don’t know. I can’t believe they’re making me take this test. ,75
42843,JERRY," Hey, did you talk to the doctor? ",75

42846,ELAINE, You took her medicine. ,75
42847,JERRY, Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again? ,75
42848,ELAINE, I don’t know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists aren’t real doctors. ,75
42849,JERRY, How could you say that? ,75
42850,ELAINE, It’s you fault. You just got me thinking. ,75
42851,JERRY, I was merely speaking extemporaneously. ,75
42852,ELAINE, I’ve got nothing against the foot. I’m pro-foot. ,75
42853,JERRY, Me too. ,75
42854,ELAINE, Do you think I should call him and apologize? ,75
42855,JERRY, Yes. He’s a doctor.  Wait a second.   What are you doing? ,75
42856,GEORGE, What does it look like I’m doing? ,75
42857,JERRY,"  ""Matthew, Luke, Paul"", what you’re cheating on your conversion chest? ",75
42858,KRAMER, I told you. ,75
42859,JERRY, What? ,75
42860,KRAMER, I told you she liked me. ,75
42861,JERRY, Who? ,75
42862,KRAMER, Sister Roberta. ,75
42863,JERRY, How do you know? ,75
42864,KRAMER, She told me. She said she’s never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. She’s questioning her faith. She’s thinking of leaving the church. ,75
42865,JERRY, Wow,75
42866,KRAMER," Oh, uh, this power. I’m dangerous Jerry, I’m very very dangerous. ",75
42867,GEORGE," Oh, I’m I’m full of it Father. ",75
42868,GEORGE," Oh, I understand.  Hey.",75
42869,KRAMER,"  Yea, Hey.  Um, you wanted to see me Father? ",75
42870,KRAMER," I know what this is about Father. I didn’t do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. It’s just that, that I have this power. ",75
42871,KRAMER, Kavorka? ,75
42872,KRAMER, I don’t understand. ,75
42873,KRAMER, Help me Father. Help me. ,75
42874,JERRY, What is that stench? I got it.  Ah hah. ,75
42875,KRAMER, Hey. ,75
42876,JERRY, Hey. What are you doing? ,75
42877,KRAMER, I’ve got the Kavorka Jerry. ,75
42878,JERRY, The Kavorka? What’s that? ,75
42879,KRAMER, The lure of the animal. I’m dangerous. ,75
42880,JERRY, What is this thing around your neck? ,75
42881,KRAMER, The priests they’re helping me. I just bathed in vinegar. ,75
42882,JERRY, You know you’re funcifying the whole building. ,75
42883,KRAMER, Keep away Jerry. Keep away. ,75
42884,JERRY, Kramer.  Kramer. ,75
42885,WOMAN, George Costanza? Estelle’s son? ,75
42886,ESTELLE, Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this? ,75
42887,GEORGE, For a woman. ,75
42888,FRANK, A woman? What are you out of your mind? ,75
42889,ESTELLE, Why can’t you do anything like a normal person? ,75
42890,FRANK, Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels? ,75
42891,GEORGE, No it’s a regular religion. ,75
42892,FRANK, I’m calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this. ,75
42893,GEORGE, I don’t want to get out of it. ,75
42894,ESTELLE," Bu George, you don’t know what you’re saying. You’re under their control. ",75
42895,FRANK," What, they brainwashed you? ",75
42896,GEORGE, No no. ,75
42897,FRANK, You’re not performing any rituals in this house. ,75
42898,ESTELLE, Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you. ,75
42899,FRANK, And stay away from those squirrels. ,75
42900,TAWNI, Oh how you doing Jerry? ,75
42901,JERRY, Good. What’s the matter? ,75
42902,TAWNI, I’m tired. I hardly slept last night with all this scratching. Bonkers was going crazy. ,75
42903,JERRY, Bonkers? ,75
42904,TAWNI," My cat. He’s got this weird sort of skin condition. Some type of fungus, I couldn’t find his medicine. ",75
42905,JERRY, Oh it’s your cat! ,75
42906,TAWNI, What? ,75
42907,JERRY," Ooh, nothing. ",75
42908,GEORGE, Yes faddah. ,75
42909,GEORGE, What? ,75
42910,GEORGE," I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous. ",75
42911,KRAMER, How you doing? ,75
42912,WOMAN, Get away from me you creep.  ,75
42913,KRAMER," Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta I’ve still got time to catch her. ",75
42914,SISTER ROBERTA,"  I can’t.  I’m sorry. It’s a beautiful religion, but I am not worthy of it. I found something else. ",75
42915,SISTER ROBERTA, Him. ,75
42916,CROWD," Kavorka, Kavorka. ",75
42917,ELAINE,"  You know, because I love the foot. I’m a big fan of the foot. ",75
42918,DOCTOR, Well it’s my fault. I got a little defensive. ,75
42919,ELAINE," And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe. ",75
42920,DOCTOR, It’s my favorite toe. ,75
42921,ELAINE," Let’s face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? You’re not going to the ear guy. ",75
42922,DOCTOR, No you’re not. ,75
42923,ELAINE, I’ll be right back. ,75
42924,DOCTOR," Oh uh, where’s the bathroom? ",75
42925,ELAINE, It’s right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here. ,75
42926,JERRY, Elaine it’s her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back. ,75
42927,DOCTOR,"  ""Fungicide""? Fungus? ",75
42928,SISTER ROBERTA, Something’s wrong. I don’t feel the same lure. ,75
42929,KRAMER, You don’t? ,75
42930,SISTER ROBERTA, What have I…? I must return to the church. By the way you really need to take a bath. You stink. ,75
42931,KRAMER, Yeah yeah. ,75
42932,JERRY," But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, ""Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on.""",75
42933,SASHA, For me? ,75
42934,GEORGE, Well I didn’t do it for my mother. ,75
42935,SASHA, I’m really flattered. But I just don’t feel ready to make a commitment yet. Maybe when I get back from Latvia. ,75
42936,GEORGE, Latvia? ,75
42937,SASHA, Yes. I’m going to stay with some relatives there for a year. Isn’t it great? ,75
42938,GEORGE," Enjoy, enjoy. ",75
42939,SASHA," Oh George, you are so sweet. Don’t ever change. ",75
42940,GEORGE, I’d like a doggie bag for this please. ,75
42941,JERRY, The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.,76
42942,ELAINE," Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here ",76

42949,JANE, no there's not enough to spare ,76
42950,ELAINE," well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it ",76
42951,JANE," I'm sorry I don't have a square to spare, now if you don't mind ",76

42953,JANE," no I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square ",76
42954,ELAINE," oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply ",76
42955,JANE," look, I don't have a square and I don't have a ply  ",76
42956,ELAINE," No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you ",76
42957,JERRY,  hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent ,76
42958,JANE, you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom ,76
42959,JERRY, what? ,76
42960,ELAINE, hey ,76

42966,ELAINE, 3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares! ,76
42967,JANE," she wouldn't stop ""help me! help me!"" she was insane ",76
42968,ELAINE," I was begging her ""please! please!"" she was insane ",76
42969,JERRY, who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out ,76
42970,JANE, I don't know what she looks like ,76
42971,JERRY, I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony ,76

43243,JERRY, oh you're crazy ,76
43244,KRAMER, Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind? ,76

43246,KRAMER, iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top? ,76
43247,JERRY, it can't be ,76

43255,ELAINE," yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway ",76
43256,JERRY, oh I though you didn't care about his looks ,76
43257,ELAINE, I lied ,76
43258,JERRY, aha ,76
43259,ELAINE," are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony , I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry ",76
43260,JERRY, oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there? ,76
43261,ELAINE," yeah, yeah ",76

43266,JERRY, how's you get her to meet here? ,76
43267,KRAMER," I don't know, we have a certain chemistry ",76
43268,JERRY, oh my god ,76

43274,JERRY, selling sexual pleasure over the phone? ,76
43275,JANE, I sell paper goods you jerk ,76
43276,JERRY, paper goods? ,76
43277,ELAINE," excuse me, do you have a tissue? ",76
43278,JANE," No, I'm sorry, I can't spare it, there's not enough to spare ",76
43279,JANE, Where's the ladies' room  ,76
43280,ELAINE, I have to go to the bathroom too  ,76
43281,JANE, oh damn ,76
43282,ELAINE, something.. wrong? ,76
43283,JANE," yeah there's no toilet paper in here, I usually check but would you mind? ",76
43284,ELAINE," I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square ",76
43285,JANE," Hey, wait a minute, I know you ",76
43286,ELAINE," that's right honey, and I know you! ",76
43287,JANE," no, no, no!!! ",76
43288,ELAINE," here, take it ",76
43289,JERRY, thanks,76
43290,JANE,  don't call me anymore ,76
43291,JANE,  you either ,76
43292,JERRY," Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going ""boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly."" ",76
43293,JERRY,"It is my opinion that we never should have landed a man on the moon. It's a mistake. Now everything is compared to that one accomplishment. Now every body goes “I can't believe they could land a man on the moon . . . and taste my coffee!” I think we all would have been a lot happier if we hadn't landed a man on the moon. Then we'd go, They can't make a prescription bottle top that's easy to open? I'm not surprised they couldn't land a man on the moon. Things make perfect sense to me now. Neil Armstrong should have said, ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for every whining, complaining, SOB on the face of the earth.""",77
43294,ELAINE," Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.",77
43295,JERRY, I once got Happy New Yeared in March.,77
43296,ELAINE, It's disgusting.,77
43297,JERRY," It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?",77
43298,ELAINE, Really cold.,77
43299,JERRY, Scary cold.,77
43300,ELAINE, I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?,77
43301,JERRY, That. ,77
43302,ELAINE,"  What is that, ha?",77
43303,GEORGE, What?,77
43304,JERRY, When did you get that?,77
43305,GEORGE, This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?,77
43306,JERRY," You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?",77
43307,ELAINE," Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.",77
43308,JERRY, Look at this,77
43309,ELAINE," Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...",77
43310,GEORGE," All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.",77
43311,ELAINE, Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.,77
43312,JERRY, Yeah. ,77
43313,GEORGE, What for?,77
43314,ELAINE, These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.,77
43315,GEORGE, Why?,77
43316,ELAINE," Because it's rude, otherwise.",77
43317,GEORGE," You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?",77
43318,ELAINE, Yes.,77
43319,GEORGE," So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?",77
43320,JERRY, The fabric of society is very complex George.,77
43321,GEORGE, I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.,77
43322,ELAINE, Ya can't bring Pepsi. ,77
43323,GEORGE, Why not?,77
43324,ELAINE, Because we're adults?,77
43325,GEORGE," You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh , no way wine is better than Pepsi.",77
43326,JERRY," I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.",77
43327,GEORGE, I just don't like the idea that any time there’s a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.,77
43328,JERRY," You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.",77
43329,KRAMER," All right, let's go. Who's driving? ",77
43330,JERRY, You are. I can't get that thing in my car. ,77
43331,KRAMER, Uh huh.,77
43332,JERRY," Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze.",77
43333,ELAINE," Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!",77
43334,GEORGE, Hehehehehe ,77
43335,JERRY," You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?",77
43336,GEORGE," Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.",77
43337,ELAINE," You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.",77
43338,GEORGE," Oh, here we go...",77
43339,ELAINE, What?,77
43340,GEORGE, Why don't we get them a couch?  We’ll rent a U-haul -- we’ll bring ‘em a nice sectional.,77
43341,KRAMER, Yeahhehehehe,77
43342,ELAINE, We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?,77
43343,KRAMER,"  All right, yeah.",77
43344,GEORGE, Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?,77
43345,ELAINE, Ring Dings?,77
43346,GEORGE," Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.",77
43347,KRAMER, Ooooh I like Ring Dings.,77
43348,ELAINE," George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.",77
43349,KRAMER, HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! ,77
43350,GEORGE,"  It's a funeral procession. . . .  And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, ""just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .",77
43351,ELAINE," Oh, Kramer, that’s the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.",77
43352,KRAMER,  All right.,77
43353,ELAINE," Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is…",77
43354,JERRY, Jerry.,77
43355,ELAINE," Yeah, Jerry, Jerry -- come with me.",77
43356,KRAMER," Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.",77
43357,ELAINE, Yeah.,77
43358,KRAMER, All right,77
43359,ELAINE," Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.",77
43360,JERRY," Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.",77
43361,ELAINE, Mmm.,77
43362,JERRY, I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?,77
43363,ELAINE, You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.,77
43364,JERRY, I'm looking forward to it.,77
43365,ELAINE, Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.,77
43366,JERRY," Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?",77
43367,ELAINE, CHOCOLATE BABKA! That's their specialty.,77
43368,JERRY, Love that babka.,77
43369,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah!",77
43370,JERRY," So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.",77
43371,ELAINE, Why?,77
43372,JERRY," I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.",77
43373,ELAINE, You think it's effeminate?,77
43374,JERRY, It's a tad dainty.,77
43375,ELAINE," Oh, we forgot to pick a number.",77
43376,JERRY," Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.",77
43377,ELAINE, I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?,77
43378,JERRY," Ah, no, forget it.",77
43379,ELAINE," No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask ‘em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.",77
43380,KRAMER,"  Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?",77
43381,GEORGE," Ah, Just double park.",77
43382,KRAMER," No, no.",77
43383,GEORGE, Why not?,77
43384,KRAMER," I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?",77
43385,GEORGE," Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give ‘em up.",77
43386,KRAMER, That's a fallacy.,77
43387,GEORGE," All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?",77
43388,KRAMER, Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?,77
43389,GEORGE," Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.",77
43390,KRAMER, So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.,77
43391,GEORGE, Does the heater even work in this car?,77
43392,KRAMER, No.,77
43393,GEORGE," Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see",77
43394,KRAMER, I see.,77
43395,GEORGE," You see, hu, ho ho.",77
43396,ELAINE, But we were here ahead of you.,77
43397,BARBARA, How do I know that?,77
43398,JERRY, Well we saw you come in.,77
43399,DAVID," Well, that's easy for you to say.",77
43400,ELAINE," Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.",77
43401,CLERK, 46?,77
43402,ELAINE," Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?",77
43403,BARBARA, Yes.,77
43404,ELAINE," Oh my god. I, I know you. I-I’m, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.",77
43405,BARBARA, I'm on my way over there right now.,77
43406,ELAINE, Yeah me too.,77
43407,DAVID, You're Jerry right?,77
43408,JERRY, David!,77
43409,ELAINE," Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?",77
43410,BARBARA, Yes it is.,77
43411,ELAINE," You know we were here, ahead of you.",77
43412,BARBARA, You're NOT getting my number.,77
43413,JERRY, Oh so you still don't believe us.,77
43414,CLERK, 47!,77
43415,BARBARA, That’s Us.,77
43416,ELAINE," Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.",77
43417,BARBARA," Well, I'll be there ahead of you and I'LL be telling them what a jerk YOU are. . . .  I'll have the chocolate babka.",77
43418,CLERK, You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one.,77
43419,GEORGE," Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!",77
43420,KRAMER," Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?",77
43421,GEORGE, What's that?,77
43422,KRAMER," Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars.",77
43423,GEORGE, Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you they’re not getting no twelve dollar cake.,77
43424,KRAMER," All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.",77
43425,GEORGE, . . . Why not?,77
43426,KRAMER, Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. ,77
43427,GEORGE," ""throws your hips off kilter"" So where's your money? ",77
43428,KRAMER, I never take it.,77
43429,GEORGE, So what do you do?,77
43430,KRAMER," Oh, I get by.",77
43431,BARBARA, See you later ,77
43432,JERRY, That's the last babka. They got the last babka.,77
43433,ELAINE, I know. They're going in first with the last babka.,77
43434,JERRY, That was our babka.,77
43435,ELAINE, You can't beat a babka.,77
43436,JERRY, We had that babka.,77
43437,ELAINE,  They're going to be heroes.,77
43438,JERRY, Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.,77
43439,ELAINE, Well how about a carrot cake?,77
43440,JERRY, Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.,77
43441,ELAINE, Black Forrest?,77
43442,JERRY," Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.",77
43443,JERRY, How about a Napoleon?,77
43444,ELAINE, Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.,77
43445,JERRY, That was our babka. We had that babka!,77
43446,ELAINE, What's this one?,77
43447,CLERK," That, Cinnamon Babka.",77
43448,ELAINE, ,77

43450,CLERK, There's chocolate and there's cinnamon.,77
43451,JERRY, Well-well we got to get the cinnamon.,77
43452,ELAINE," No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.",77
43453,JERRY," I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, ""Oh This is so good. What's in it?"" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.",77
43454,CLERK, 49?,77
43455,ELAINE, I'll have a cinnamon babka.,77
43456,JERRY," … and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!",77
43457,CLERK, That’ll be 13.05,77
43458,GEORGE, All right here you go.,77
43459,KRAMER, Yeuu.,77
43460,CLERK, A hundred? I can't change that.,77
43461,GEORGE," You can't - huhu, All right let's go.",77
43462,KRAMER, Wait a second. I can get change.,77
43463,KRAMER," Hey, anybody got change for a hundred?",77
43464,GEORGE, Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!,77
43465,KRAMER, What?,77
43466,GEORGE, Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.,77
43467,KRAMER," Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.",77
43468,GEORGE, I am not buying something just to get change.,77
43469,KRAMER," George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.",77
43470,GEORGE," All right, what are we doing?",77
43471,KRAMER, Just get some gum or something.,77
43472,GEORGE, Pack of gum. Here you go. ,77
43473,CLERK, What is it a hundred? I can't change a hundred.,77
43474,GEORGE, Why not?,77

43482,GEORGE, We’re up to two dollars here.,77
43483,KRAMER," Here, George, get a Penthouse Forum.",77
43484,GEORGE, I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.,77
43485,KRAMER," Why? No, that’ll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.",77
43486,GEORGE," Oh, that's nice.",77
43487,KRAMER," Come on, did you ever read one of these?",77
43488,GEORGE, It's not real. They're all made up.,77
43489,KRAMER," Ohh, it's real.",77
43490,GEORGE," Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES!  . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.",77
43491,CLERK, 6.75.,77
43492,GEORGE," Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.",77
43493,KRAMER," All right, all right.",77
43494,GEORGE," Yes, I’m Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex.",77
43495,KRAMER, You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.,77
43496,JERRY," Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.",77
43497,ELAINE," Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. ",77
43498,JERRY, Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.,77
43499,ELAINE,  Well what is this?,77
43500,JERRY, What?,77
43501,ELAINE, It's a hair.,77
43502,JERRY," Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.",77
43503,ELAINE," No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.",77
43504,JERRY," No no come on really, get another one. It’ll take a second.",77
43505,ELAINE," Alright, alright.",77
43506,ELAINE, Excuse me.,77
43507,ELAINE," No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a  hair on it.",77
43508,CLERK, You have to take a number.,77
43509,ELAINE, We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing  you’re gonna wait now?,77
43510,JERRY," Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.",77
43511,ELAINE, Well it was a little hair. I took it off.,77
43512,JERRY, A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?,77
43513,ELAINE, What if it's your hair?,77
43514,JERRY, What if it's your hair?,77
43515,ELAINE,  What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.,77
43516,JERRY," Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. ",77
43517,ELAINE," Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.",77
43518,JERRY," Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?",77
43519,ELAINE, No I'm bringing cake! ,77
43520,GEORGE, All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!,77
43521,KRAMER,"  ""I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true…""  "" A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was…""",77
43522,GEORGE, L-Look at this?,77
43523,KRAMER, Ahh.,77
43524,GEORGE," Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?",77
43525,KRAMER," ""…well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out…."" ",77
43526,GEORGE, I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?,77
43527,KRAMER," No, no I can't comprehend it?",77
43528,GEORGE, I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?,77
43529,KRAMER," Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.",77
43530,GEORGE, So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.,77
43531,KRAMER," Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?",77
43532,GEORGE, Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?,77
43533,KRAMER," How about Idi Amin, huh?",77
43534,GEORGE," I’ll tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!",77
43535,KRAMER, Are those shoes comfortable?,77
43536,GEORGE, No not really.,77
43537,KRAMER, Cause they look comfortable.,77
43538,GEORGE, I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.,77
43539,ELAINE, Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?,77
43540,JERRY, No. That’s out of the question.,77
43541,ELAINE, Whhhy?,77
43542,JERRY, Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.,77
43543,ELAINE, What happened?,77
43544,JERRY, I'd rather not talk about it.,77
43545,ELAINE, You can't tell me?,77
43546,JERRY, All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.,77
43547,ELAINE, You found a hair in your Farina?,77
43548,JERRY, Yeah.,77
43549,ELAINE, What happened?,77
43550,JERRY," Well I started screaming, ""There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina."" Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running  and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.",77
43551,ELAINE,  Wow. Who's hair was it?,77
43552,JERRY, My mother's.,77
43553,ELAINE,  Ahhhhh,77
43554,CLERK, 58!,77
43555,ELAINE," Ooo, That's us. ",77
43556,JERRY," Oh, good.",77
43557,ELAINE, You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.,77
43558,CLERK, ,77
43559,JERRY," Oh, that's lovely.",77
43560,ELAINE," Ah,",77
43561,JERRY," That’s what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.",77
43562,JERRY," Yeah that’s a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.",77
43563,CLERK, Here you are. ,77
43564,ELAINE, Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?,77
43565,KRAMER," HEY DOUBLE-PARKER!  SHOW YOURSELF.  COME ON OUT, I’M FREEZING! ",77
43566,GEORGE, We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.,77
43567,KRAMER, Why?,77
43568,GEORGE, You know -- Elaine.,77
43569,KRAMER, What about her?,77
43570,GEORGE, . . . I'm a little scared of her.,77
43571,KRAMER, You're scared of Elaine?,77
43572,GEORGE, Yes!,77
43573,KRAMER, Why?,77
43574,GEORGE," Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.",77
43575,KRAMER," Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. I’m freezin in here.",77
43576,GEORGE, Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?,77
43577,KRAMER, Because I wanted to look good for the party.,77
43578,GEORGE," Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!",77
43579,GEORGE, I wasn't talking to you.,77
43580,ELAINE," Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.",77
43581,JERRY," Huh, wa?",77
43582,ELAINE, What's the matter with you?,77
43583,JERRY," I don’t know, I don't feel so good.",77
43584,ELAINE, What's wrong?,77
43585,JERRY," My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.",77
43586,ELAINE, The black and white?,77
43587,JERRY, Yeah.,77
43588,ELAINE, Not getting’ along?,77
43589,JERRY, I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.,77
43590,ELAINE,  “Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?”,77
43591,JERRY, Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.,77
43592,ELAINE," Wait, what about your vomit streak?",77
43593,JERRY," I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.",77
43594,ELAINE," Oh, oh! Ooh my god. Oh!",77
43595,ELAINE," Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC!… ",77
43596,ELAINE,"  ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe.  W-Where're you going?",77
43597,JERRY, Fourteen years down the drain. ,77
43598,GEORGE, Do you think chickens have individual personalities?,77
43599,KRAMER,  I don't know.,77
43600,GEORGE," If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities I’m not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?",77
43601,KRAMER,  Waj cha jia ja,77
43602,CLERK, Can I help you guys with anything?,77
43603,GEORGE," Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.",77
43604,CLERK, Well wait outside. This isn't a hangout.,77
43605,GEORGE, But my friend here has hypothermia.,77
43606,KRAMER,  Hypothermia.,77
43607,CLERK," All right guys, take it outside.",77
43608,CLERK, You're paying for these.,77
43609,ELAINE, How was it?,77
43610,JERRY, As good as it gets.,77
43611,GEORGE," You know that coat was Gore-Tex. It’s worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay.",77
43612,KRAMER,  You know I'm freezin. I’m definitely freezin. I can't stop shaking.,77
43613,GEORGE, I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.,77
43614,KRAMER,  L-l ,77
43615,GEORGE," Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator.",77
43616,CLERK, Can I get’ca anything else?,77
43617,JERRY," Oh, no thanks.",77
43618,CLERK," How about a nice box of ""scram"".",77
43619,GEORGE," S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though.",77
43620,GEORGE," What, what happened to you?",77
43621,ELAINE, Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...,77
43622,JERRY," Hey, what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya, What are you drunk?",77
43623,GEORGE, I had to give it to the liquor store guy.,77
43624,JERRY, What for?,77
43625,GEORGE," I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get?",77
43626,ELAINE, Cinnamon babka.,77
43627,GEORGE, Cinnamon? Why didn't ‘cha get chocolate?,77
43628,JERRY, George!,77
43629,ELAINE," Here, here's your cake. ",77
43630,GEORGE, And your wine.,77
43631,ELAINE, See ya'.,77
43632,JERRY, See ya'.,77
43633,JERRY,"JERRY: I love these nature shows, I’ll watch and kind of nature show, and it’s amazing how you can always relate, to whatever they’re talking about. You know like you’re watching the African Dung Beetle and you’re going “Boy, his life is a lot like mine.” And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if it’s the antelope, and there’s a lion chasing the antelope you go, “Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away!” But the next week it’s the lion, and then you go “Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, don’t let him use his speed!”",78
43634,ELAINE,  Well did he bring it up in the meeting?,78
43635,JERRY," Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him… Golden Boy.",78
43636,ELAINE," Yeah, I'm on the phone here.",78
43637,JERRY, Golden Boy’s always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy!,78
43638,ELAINE," No thanks.  Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.",78
43639,JERRY," But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.",78
43640,ELAINE, Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?,78
43641,JERRY," No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!",78
43642,ELAINE," Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! that’s fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye.  Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!",78
43643,JERRY, The guy who’s in the gulag?!,78
43644,ELAINE," Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine!",78
43645,JERRY, You wanna barrow Golden Boy!,78
43646,ELAINE," Oh!  Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!",78
43647,JERRY," Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for ""War and Peace"" was ""War--What Is It Good For?""!",78
43648,ELAINE, ...  ....Ha ha ha ha.,78
43649,JERRY," No, no… I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to ""War and Peace""!",78
43650,ELAINE, But it's a line from that song!,78
43651,JERRY, That's were they got it from!,78
43652,ELAINE, Really?,78
43653,JERRY, I'm not joking!,78
43654,GEORGE, … You can't handle the truth!  ,78
43655,JERRY, What?,78
43656,GEORGE,"  I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! ",78
43657,ELAINE, What is this your mail? ,78
43658,GEORGE," Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it.",78
43659,ELAINE, Oh! Your Alumni Magazine.,78

43666,JERRY, You've caught your mother opening envelopes!,78
43667,GEORGE, Yes.,78
43668,JERRY, What did she say?,78
43669,GEORGE, I was curious! ,78
43670,JERRY, Isn't that against the law?,78
43671,GEORGE, Maybe I can get her locked up.,78
43672,ELAINE,"  Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this",78
43673,JERRY, He can't handle the truth!,78

43735,DIANE, I can't believe it. I-I would never had thought…,78
43736,JERRY," Yeah... he’s specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales… all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know it’s the largest mammal on earth but as George says ""they don't have to be.""",78

43772,LIPPMAN," You know, Tolstoy use to write in the village square. The faces inspired him.",78
43773,TESTIKOV,  He did not need inspiration… God spoke through his pen. Hu Hu Hu ,78
43774,ELAINE," Ohh, That is so true! ",78
43775,LIPPMAN, Yes.,78
43776,ELAINE," Although one wonders if ""War and Peace"" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title ""War---What Is It Good For?""",78
43777,LIPPMAN, What?,78

43786,ELAINE, …they-they took it from Tolstoy.,78
43787,LIPPMAN, No. e-Elaine.,78
43788,TESTIKOV, War--What Is It Good For?,78
43789,LIPPMAN, It-no- it's just her sense of humor.,78
43790,ELAINE, No it’s not. That really is true.,78
43791,TESTIKOV, What is that noise!,78
43792,LIPPMAN, It’s Not…,78
43793,ELAINE, Yes it is…,78

43808,TESTIKOV, Will you Turn it off!,78
43809,LIPPMAN, The one at the top.,78

43811,TESTIKOV, Aaach!,78
43812,LIPPMAN, Yeah… Ohoo.,78
43813,JERRY, I did it for you.,78
43814,GEORGE," I don’t know what’cha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.",78
43815,JERRY, You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.,78
43816,GEORGE," Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.",78
43817,JERRY," Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and…",78
43818,GEORGE," Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.",78

43824,JERRY, Well what happened?,78
43825,KRAMER, I have no concentration!,78
43826,JERRY," What, what, what's wrong with you?",78

43831,JERRY, She’s waking down the street and it hit her in the head!,78

43841,JERRY, What is with this thing.,78
43842,CORINNE,"  I don't know, it never shuts up. So anyway, you could see why I would be interested in finding this person.",78
43843,JERRY, Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.,78
43844,CORINNE,  Stop it! Stop it!,78
43845,JERRY, Let me have a look at this thing.,78
43846,CORINNE, Ya know it was somebody told me they thought they saw that thing come out of a limousine.,78
43847,JERRY," Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.",78
43848,CORINNE, Boy am I lucky your name came up. I just pushed a button.,78

43881,ELAINE,"  Where is it, give it to me!",78
43882,JERRY, I don't have it!,78
43883,ELAINE, Why not.,78
43884,JERRY, Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.,78
43885,ELAINE," But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!",78
43886,JERRY, How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?,78
43887,ELAINE, One million.,78
43888,JERRY, Well that's a start.,78

43937,ELAINE," Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?",78
43938,TESTIKOV,  yes. How could I forget? heehe.,78
43939,ELAINE,"  Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.",78

43952,DIANE, Save the whale George... for me.,78
43953,GEORGE," So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment … I was a Marine Biologist!",78
43954,ELAINE," George I’ve just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!",78
43955,GEORGE, I know I was just telling them the story.,78
43956,KRAMER," Well come on George, finish the story.",78
43957,GEORGE, The sea was angry that day my friends… like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!,78
43958,GEORGE," I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, ""Easy big fella!"" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its’ breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!",78
43959,JERRY, Mammal.,78
43960,GEORGE, Whatever.,78
43961,KRAMER," Well then, what did you do next?",78
43962,GEORGE," Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him,  face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there… so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!",78
43963,KRAMER, What is that a Titleist?,78
43964,GEORGE, ,78
43965,KRAMER, A hole in one eh.,78
43966,JERRY, Well the-the crowd must have gone wild!,78
43967,GEORGE," Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me…",78
43968,KRAMER,  Um-hm.,78
43969,GEORGE," …kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.",78
43970,JERRY, Wow! What'd she say?,78
43971,GEORGE," Told me to ""Go to hell!"" and I took the bus home.",78
43972,JERRY, All right lets go.,78
43973,ELAINE," What, are you in a bad mood?",78
43974,JERRY, Ahhh… got my laundry back.,78

43976,JERRY, He didn't make it.,78
43977,ELAINE, I'm sorry. ,78
43978,JERRY, Yea.  This is Golden Boy's son… Baby Blue.,78
43979,KRAMER,  What's with you?,78
43980,GEORGE, Sand. It's everywhere,78
43981,KRAMER, Yep.,78
43982,JERRY,"JERRY: Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. ""What ever happened to Bob?"" ""Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face."" Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. ""Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived.""",79
43983,AUDREY, Hum! That was really good! ,79
43984,JERRY, Yeah. are you full? ,79
43985,AUDREY," Oh no, I've had just enough. ",79
43986,JERRY," Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city.  Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some. ",79
43987,AUDREY, No thanks. ,79
43988,JERRY, You're not gonna have any? ,79
43989,AUDREY, No  ,79
43990,JERRY, Do you not like apple pie? ,79
43991,AUDREY," No, it's not that. ",79
43992,JERRY," Well, at least taste it. ",79
43993,AUDREY, No  ,79
43994,JERRY, You won't even taste it? ,79
43995,AUDREY, No. ,79
43996,JERRY," Come on, try it!  A little taste!  Come on.  ",79
43997,JERRY, She wouldn't so much as taste it.,79
43998,GEORGE, Did she say why? ,79
43999,JERRY, No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this  ,79
44000,GEORGE, Maybe she's diabetic. ,79
44001,JERRY, No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse. ,79
44002,GEORGE, Maybe you said something that offended her. ,79
44003,JERRY, The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city. ,79
44004,GEORGE, Like at the airport?  ,79
44005,JERRY, Yeah. ,79
44006,GEORGE, That's a great idea!!! ,79
44007,JERRY, Tell me about it! ,79
44008,GEORGE, We could be zipping all over the place. ,79
44009,JERRY, They could at least try it. ,79
44010,GEORGE, They never try anything. ,79
44011,JERRY, What's the harm? ,79
44012,GEORGE, No harm! ,79
44013,JERRY,  I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie. ,79
44014,ELAINE, Who wouldn't taste a pie? ,79
44015,JERRY, Audrey. ,79
44016,ELAINE, Dump her. ,79
44017,JERRY," Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie??? ",79
44018,ELAINE,  I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie. ,79
44019,JERRY, You did? ,79
44020,ELAINE," He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness. ",79
44021,GEORGE," Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways.  What are you doing? ",79
44022,ELAINE, I got a pebble. ,79
44023,JERRY," Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman? ",79
44024,ELAINE, What the hell does that mean? ,79
44025,KRAMER, Hey! Elaine. Go Like this.  ,79
44026,ELAINE, What? Why? ,79
44027,KRAMER, Do it. Do it. This. ,79
44028,ELAINE, Like...  Like this? ,79
44029,KRAMER, Oh yeah! It's you! ,79
44030,ELAINE, What's me? ,79
44031,KRAMER,  There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine. ,79
44032,ELAINE, Get out! ,79
44033,KRAMER," It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite. ",79
44034,GEORGE," Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin? ",79
44035,KRAMER, Rinitze.  Oh yeah... ,79
44036,JERRY,  Uh... may I help you?  ,79
44037,KRAMER," It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it. ",79
44038,GEORGE," Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there? ",79
44039,KRAMER, Real Boss! ,79
44040,ELAINE, I'm going down there. ,79
44041,GEORGE," I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday. ",79
44042,ELAINE,  Let's go. ,79
44043,GEORGE, All right. All right.  ,79
44044,KRAMER,  Are you gonna need this? ,79
44045,JERRY, Keep it.  ,79
44046,ELAINE, It looks exactly like me. ,79
44047,GEORGE, It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine. ,79
44048,ELAINE, What's going on here? How do you think this happened? ,79
44049,GEORGE," Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh? ",79
44050,ELAINE, You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible? ,79
44051,SALESWOMAN,  You are perfect for that suit. ,79
44052,GEORGE, You think so? ,79
44053,ELAINE,  Excuse me. Where did this come from? ,79
44054,SALESWOMAN, I don't know. ,79
44055,GEORGE, You really think this looks O.K. on me? ,79
44056,SALESWOMAN, Fabulous. Perfect fit. And it's the last one we have. ,79
44057,ELAINE, I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from? ,79
44058,SALESWOMAN," I told you, I don't know. ",79
44059,ELAINE,"  Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know? ",79
44060,SALESWOMAN, Why? ,79
44061,ELAINE, Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me. ,79
44062,ELAINE,"  Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you. ",79
44063,SALESWOMAN, I think maybe you're flattering yourself. That mannquein is wearing a twelve hundred dollar Gaultier dress. ,79
44064,ELAINE," What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress?  Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags.  I'll meet you outside. ",79
44065,SALESWOMAN, What is her problem? ,79
44066,GEORGE," Ah, Pfft! What can you do?  Is this the price tag? ",79
44067,SALESWOMAN, Yes. ,79
44068,GEORGE," Yes, hello. Party's over.  ",79
44069,SALESWOMAN," I'll tell you a little secret. We're having an unadvertised sale starting Friday, that suit will be half-price. ",79
44070,GEORGE, So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me? ,79
44071,SALESWOMAN," Oh, I'm afraid I could't do that. It wouldn't be fair to the other customers. ",79
44072,GEORGE," Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair.  ",79
44073,ELAINE," So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up. ",79
44074,KRAMER," Well, how did they get your face? ",79
44075,ELAINE, I don't know. They wouldn't tell me.  Jerry? Je... Hello? ,79
44076,JERRY,  Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie. ,79
44077,JERRY, And you waved it away. ,79
44078,JERRY, Did you give her a reason? ,79
44079,JERRY, You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head. ,79
44080,JERRY," Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip.  Well, I think we proven who the psycho is. ",79
44081,ELAINE, We certainly have. ,79
44082,KRAMER," Hey, Elaine scratch my back. ",79
44083,ELAINE, No way! ,79
44084,KRAMER," Come on, one lap around. ",79
44085,ELAINE, No. ,79
44086,KRAMER, It will be a funky adventure. ,79
44087,ELAINE," Kramer, forget it. ",79
44088,KRAMER," Jerry, how about you? ",79
44089,JERRY, I think you know my policy. ,79
44090,KRAMER, I'm going home to spatula.  ,79
44091,ELAINE, I thought George was meeting us here? ,79
44092,JERRY, No he's going downtown to guard the suit. ,79
44093,ELAINE, He's guarding a suit? ,79
44094,OLIVE,  Do you need some help with that itch? ,79
44095,KRAMER," Madam, I pray you're not toying with me.  Whoa. ",79
44096,OLIVE, Turn around. ,79
44097,KRAMER," Oh, all right.  ",79
44098,SALESWOMAN,  It fits you perfectly. ,79
44099,BOB, You think so?  ,79
44100,GEORGE,  What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second?  Can I help you? ,79
44101,BOB, I'm buying the suit. ,79
44102,GEORGE," No, no, no, this suit is not for sale.  ",79
44103,BOB," Excuse me, do you work here? ",79
44104,GEORGE,  No. ,79
44105,BOB, Then what the hell business is it of yours? ,79
44106,GEORGE," Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday. ",79
44107,BOB, Really? ,79
44108,GEORGE, Yea Yea Yea,79
44109,BOB, This Monday? ,79
44110,GEORGE, Yes. Now take off those pants. ,79
44111,SALESWOMAN," Actually, the unadvertised sale starts on Friday. ",79
44112,BOB, Friday? Thanks.  ,79
44113,GEORGE,"  You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it. ",79
44114,JERRY, I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here? ,79
44115,AUDREY, Everything is delicious. ,79
44116,JERRY, You've tasted them? ,79
44117,AUDREY," Um-hmm, I think almost all of them. ",79
44118,JERRY, Oh I see they have apple pie. ,79
44119,AUDREY, Mmm-hmm. ,79
44120,JERRY, You've had the apple pie? ,79
44121,AUDREY, Many times. ,79
44122,JERRY," Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind. ",79
44123,AUDREY, Can we drop this? ,79
44124,JERRY,  Why can't I know? ,79
44125,AUDREY, Ah! Poppie. ,79
44126,POPPIE," Sweetheart, hello. ",79
44127,AUDREY," Poppie, this is Jerry. ",79
44128,POPPIE, Welcome  ,79
44129,JERRY, Hello Poppie. ,79
44130,POPPIE, Don't fill up on the bread. I'm making you a very special dinner. Very special.  ,79
44131,JERRY, The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know.  ,79
44132,POPPIE," Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey. ",79
44133,AUDREY, Jerry are you OK? ,79
44134,JERRY, Huh? ,79
44135,AUDREY, Is anything wrong? ,79
44136,JERRY," No, Nothing. ",79
44137,AUDREY, You look like you've seen a ghost. ,79
44138,OLIVE,  I'll see you tomorrow. ,79
44139,KRAMER, Hey. These are for you Olive. ,79
44140,OLIVE, Thank you. ,79
44141,KRAMER, Ohh! ,79
44142,POPPIE, Here it is. ,79
44143,AUDREY," Wait till you taste this.  Poppie, this is perfect. ",79
44144,POPPIE,  Well? ,79
44145,AUDREY, Jerry have some.  You're not gonna taste it?  Jerry.  ,79
44146,JERRY, So she tought I did it to get back at her ,79
44147,GEORGE, Why didn't you just tell her? ,79
44148,JERRY," I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene. ",79
44149,GEORGE, How could he not have washed? ,79
44150,JERRY," Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something. ",79
44151,GEORGE," Yeah, just like I do. ",79
44152,JERRY," You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught. ",79
44153,GEORGE," Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it? ",79
44154,JERRY, We haven't spoken. ,79
44155,KRAMER," Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive.  ",79
44156,GEORGE, Olive? ,79
44157,KRAMER, Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks. ,79
44158,GEORGE, Oh.,79
44159,KRAMER," You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen. ",79
44160,GEORGE, I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes. ,79
44161,KRAMER, Is that Elaine mannequin still there? ,79
44162,GEORGE, Yeah. ,79
44163,KRAMER, Yeah.,79
44164,GEORGE," The last time I saw her, she was naked. ",79
44165,JERRY," Yeah, and Poppie's got problems... ",79
44166,BOB, Where is it? Where is it? ,79
44167,GEORGE,"  Well, look at this.  This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake. ",79
44168,BOB, You bastard! You hid the suit. ,79
44169,GEORGE," Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it. ",79
44170,BOB," I hope you rot in that suit. Look I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay! ",79
44171,GEORGE," Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short. ",79
44172,ELAINE," So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects. ",79
44173,JERRY," Yeah, all right. Go ahead.  ",79
44174,ELAINE," There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose. ",79
44175,JERRY,"  Hum... ok, what else you got? ",79
44176,ELAINE," OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list. ",79
44177,JERRY," Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it? ",79
44178,ELAINE, Because you have an attitude. ,79
44179,JERRY, Georgio! Nice duds! ,79
44180,GEORGE," You're telling me.  So, what do you think? ",79
44181,JERRY, Did you hear something? ,79
44182,ELAINE," Yeah, like a swoosh. ",79
44183,JERRY, Yeah. ,79
44184,ELAINE,  It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound. ,79
44185,GEORGE, I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise.  This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour! ,79
44186,JERRY, So what? What would they care? ,79
44187,GEORGE," This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed. ",79
44188,JERRY, So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise? ,79
44189,GEORGE," Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire? ",79
44190,JERRY," You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts. ",79
44191,KRAMER," Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before. ",79
44192,JERRY, Audrey? ,79
44193,KRAMER," Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie. ",79
44194,JERRY, Was it apple? ,79
44195,KRAMER, What else? ,79
44196,JERRY, This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel! ,79
44197,STRANGER, Do I know you? ,79
44198,ELAINE, Hmm... No you don't. ,79
44199,STRANGER, Yeah! You were wearing a G-string and one of those bras with points. ,79
44200,ELAINE, The mannequin! ,79
44201,JERRY," Oh, I got to see this thing. ",79
44202,JERRY," Boy, the resemblance is uncanny. ",79
44203,ELAINE, You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window! ,79
44204,SALESWOMAN," It's our store and our mannequin, we can do whatever we want with it. ",79
44205,ELAINE," No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges.  Yes, this is my attorney. ",79
44206,SALESWOMAN,  Yeah? What law am I breaking? ,79
44207,JERRY," Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney, ",79
44208,ELAINE, Uh-huh ,79
44209,JERRY, The Charlie Macarthy hearings. ,79
44210,ELAINE, Uh-huh. Are you taking this down? ,79
44211,SALESWOMAN, I'm getting the manager.  ,79
44212,ELAINE, Jerry get the car.  ,79
44213,JERRY, What are you doing? ,79
44214,ELAINE, Just get the car! ,79
44215,JERRY," Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this. ",79
44216,JERRY," I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right? ",79
44217,ELAINE, Where are you going? ,79
44218,JERRY, Poppie's ,79
44219,MACKENZIE," Thanks for meeting me down here George. My office is out of control,  phones ringing, people running in and out.  Did you hear something? ",79
44220,GEORGE," No, I didn't hear anything. ",79
44221,MACKENZIE," Huh, that's strange.  It's quieter here. We can concentrate without people wooshing around...  That sound again. Sure you didn't hear anything? ",79
44222,GEORGE," No, can't say as I did. ",79
44223,MACKENZIE, Kind of like a... rustling. ,79
44224,GEORGE, Could be the leaves... ,79
44225,AUDREY, That's right. Poppie's on 77th. Ok we'll see you at 8,79
44226,JERRY, Hello. ,79
44227,AUDREY, What are you doing here? ,79
44228,JERRY, So how was the pie? ,79
44229,AUDREY, What pie? ,79
44230,JERRY, The apple pie you had today at Monks ,79
44231,AUDREY, I'm very busy here. ,79
44232,JERRY," Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it. ",79
44233,AUDREY, You better not let Poppie see you here. ,79
44234,HEALTH INSPECTOR," All right, I'm looking for someone named Poppie. ",79
44235,AUDREY," Uh, who are you? ",79
44236,HEALTH INSPECTOR," Board of health, we've had several complaints. ",79
44237,JERRY," Oh, about the... uh  ",79
44238,HEALTH INSPECTOR, Are you Poppie? ,79
44239,POPPIE, I'm Poppie. ,79
44240,HEALTH INSPECTOR, I think you'd better come with me. ,79
44241,POPPIE, What's the problem? ,79
44242,AUDREY, What do they want from Poppie? ,79
44243,JERRY," Well, Poppie's a little sloppy. ",79
44244,MACKENZIE, You taught I'd care about your pants wooshing? ,79
44245,GEORGE, I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted. ,79
44246,MACKENZIE," No, no, no. He got fired because he wasn't a team player. That's something we don't joke about at MacKenzie. You'll find we're team here George. We don't tolerate dissent. If you want to go your own way, you're in the wrong place. ",79
44247,GEORGE, No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me. ,79
44248,WAITER, Chocolate cream pie. Compliments of the house. ,79
44249,MACKENZIE, Oh! Hope you saved room for dessert. ,79
44250,WAITER,  The chef said that he made it special for you. ,79
44251,GEORGE, Oh...  ,79
44252,MACKENZIE," Mmm.. Best pie I've ever tasted. Take a bite George.  Well, take a bite. It's delicious.  I insist.  ",79
44253,BUSINESSMAN," If you're one of us, you'll take a bite. ",79
44254,JERRY, So you didn't get the job. ,79
44255,GEORGE, No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill. ,79
44256,JERRY," Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something. ",79
44257,KRAMER, What am I supposed to say? ,79
44258,JERRY, Tell her you lost your itch. ,79
44259,GEORGE, What happened to your itch? ,79

44279,GEORGE," It's just not good, it's not good.",80
44280,JERRY, It's not good.,80
44281,GEORGE," I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.",80

44314,JERRY," Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.",80

44333,MICKEY,"  But I got a big problem. The kid I stand in for, he's growing. He was four feet last month, now he's like four-two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can do four-two, four-three is a stretch, any higher than that and I'm gonna be out on my ass doing that para-legal crap.",80
44334,JERRY, How do you stop a kid from growing?,80
44335,KRAMER,"  I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.",80
44336,MICKEY," I offered him cigarettes,  but his stupid mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any.",80
44337,KRAMER,  What about lifts?,80
44338,MICKEY,  Out of the question.,80
44339,GEORGE,  Can't you just switch with another Midget?,80

44355,JERRY, Who couldn't.,80
44356,FULTON, I haven't cracked a smile in months.,80
44357,JERRY," Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle.  You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other.  Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.",80
44358,FULTON, It's a fine time.,80
44359,JERRY," Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....",80
44360,GEORGE,  So how were the eggs?,80
44361,DAPHNE, Eggs are eggs.,80
44362,GEORGE,"  Eggs are eggs. That is very profound.  By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so.  Listen Dophne",80
44363,DAPHNE,  Daphne.,80
44364,GEORGE," Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...",80
44365,DAPHNE,"  Oh, I forgot to tell you. Al Netchie called me today.",80
44366,GEORGE," Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?",80
44367,DAPHNE, He told me not to get involved with you.,80
44368,GEORGE, What?,80
44369,DAPHNE," Ya, he said you could never make a commitment to any one and you'd just wind up  hurting me.",80
44370,GEORGE, He said that?  What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.,80
44371,DAPHNE, Is it true?,80
44372,GEORGE," Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.",80
44373,SON, How long are you going to be away for Daddy?,80
44374,FATHER," I'm not really going away, I told you, I'll be back every other weekend.",80

44422,JERRY," No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.",80
44423,ELAINE, If you were a woman would you go out with him?,80
44424,JERRY, If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.,80
44425,ELAINE,"  Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.",80
44426,JERRY, Alright.,80

44446,JERRY," No, me either.",80
44447,GEORGE, What choice do I have?,80

44471,MICKEY, He's a good kid.,80
44472,KRAMER, Ya?,80
44473,JERRY, So what does he care if you put lifts in?,80
44474,MICKEY," You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, Everything. Oh, I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate.  What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!?",80
44475,DAPHNE," George, tomorrow's Sunday. We could sleep late, and get the paper and half breakfast and spend the morning together, go for a long walk, maybe do a little shopping, have lunch...",80
44476,GEORGE,  You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.,80
44477,DAPHNE, Why not?,80

44479,DAPHNE, I thought we were going to spend the day together.,80
44480,GEORGE," Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. ",80
44481,DAPHNE," Have you given any more thought to what we talked about? You know, moving in?",80
44482,GEORGE," Yes, oh yes very much.",80
44483,DAPHNE, Maybe you don't want to move in.,80
44484,GEORGE," No, no I do. You know it's just...",80
44485,DAPHNE,"  Maybe Al Netchie was right, maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved with you.",80
44486,GEORGE,  No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.,80

44603,DAPHNE," Heh, he was carrying these two pieces of pizza...",80
44604,JERRY,"I think that of all the places that you go all the time, the dry-cleaning relationship is one of the most bizarre. Because you keep giving each other the same thing, back and forth, over and over again. He gives it to you, you give it to him, he gives it back to you. It's like it's half his shirt, in a way. He has it as much as you do...you oughta go shopping with him. 'What do you think of this shirt?' 'That would look good with a light starch.' The only warning label people really respect is 'dry-clean only.' Ya know what I mean? Speed limits, lung cancer, cigarette warnings - your very life is at stake! People go, 'Ah, the hell with it!' But dry-clean only? 'Oh, don't put that in the wash! It's dry-clean only! Are you crazy?!'",81

44613,MERYL," No, it's 15-8.",81
44614,JERRY," I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.",81
44615,MERYL," Alright c'mon, let's get some breakfast.",81
44616,JERRY," Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor.  Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.",81
44617,MERYL ," Ooh, cashmere?",81

44627,MERYL, I'll get the short stack.,81
44628,JERRY," Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9.  Hey, how ya doin.'",81
44629,KRAMER, We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.,81
44630,JERRY," Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. ",81
44631,MERYL, You bring your own syrup?,81
44632,KRAMER, Got to.,81
44633,JERRY , You got a lot to learn about pancakes.,81
44634,MARTY , This is my wife. She died eight years ago. I been looking all over for this!,81
44635,JERRY," Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?",81

44651,MARTY ," Sure, you get the discount, too.",81
44652,JERRY," You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...",81
44653,MERYL, I'm taking him to the cleaners!,81
44654,JERRY," Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you... I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!",81

44842,ELAINE ," Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!",81
44843,GEORGE," Well, that doesn't mean anything!",81
44844,ELAINE," Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!",81
44845,JERRY ," She's right, George. Bottle-wipe is big.",81
44846,GEORGE," Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?",81
44847,JERRY,  Bottle-wipe supercedes it.,81
44848,GEORGE," Yeah, you're right, you're right.  Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?",81
44849,ELAINE," George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.",81
44850,GEORGE, Why?,81
44851,ELAINE, I...I don't know...,81
44852,GEORGE," Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!",81
44853,ELAINE," No, that's not it!",81
44854,GEORGE," Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!",81
44855,ELAINE, Why couldn't you just wait?,81
44856,GEORGE, I was there! I saw a drain!,81
44857,ELAINE, Since when is a drain a toilet?!,81
44858,GEORGE, It's all pipes! What's the difference?!,81
44859,ELAINE, Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!,81
44860,GEORGE, I'll call a plumber right now! ,81
44861,JERRY," Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?",81

44874,KRAMER, Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?,81
44875,MARTY," Who the hell are you? Huh, It's not your quilt.",81
44876,JERRY," He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.",81
44877,MARTY," Well, uh...maybe tomorrow.",81
44878,KRAMER , Maybe.,81
44879,JERRY," Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.",81
44880,KRAMER," Alright, I'm gonna see you later.",81
44881,JERRY, Where you goin'?,81
44882,KRAMER," I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.",81
44883,JERRY, I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.,81
44884,KRAMER," Hey, that's how I maintain my glow.",81

44889,PAULA," Thirteen? Well, I can't afford that.",81
44890,MARTY," Well, I'm sorry.",81
44891,ELAINE," Hi, Greg.",81
44892,GREG," Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second.",81
44893,ELAINE," Ok.  I got the machine next, buddy. ",81
44894,GREG ," Oh, well, It's all yours. ",81
44895,GEORGE, What happened? Did he bring it up?,81
44896,ELAINE," Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.",81
44897,GEORGE, Signal? What signal?,81
44898,ELAINE," Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.",81
44899,GEORGE, I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!,81
44900,ELAINE," Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.",81
44901,GEORGE," A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?",81
44902,ELAINE, Yeah! It's a social thing.,81
44903,GEORGE," What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!",81
44904,ELAINE, No! I won't be a party to this.,81
44905,GEORGE, So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?,81
44906,ELAINE," Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. ",81
44907,PAULA, I won't let you do this!,81
44908,JERRY, I want to!,81
44909,PAULA, But it isn't right! I can't.,81

44912,JERRY," Oh, the hell with her. ",81
44913,PAULA," No, Jerry, please!",81
44914,JERRY, I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.,81
44915,PAULA , I can't fight you. ,81
44916,JERRY, Do you want box or hanger?,81
44917,PAULA, You decide. ,81
44918,ELAINE," You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?",81
44919,GREG," Yeah.  Oh, there's the manager. Good. I think I'm gonna talk to her about that guy, you know, we cannot have people like that in here.",81
44920,ELAINE, Are you sure you want to do that?,81
44921,GREG," Yeah. He's disgusting! Besides, I'll take any chance I can to talk to her.",81
44922,ELAINE, You're interested in...in her? ,81
44923,GREG, Very.,81
44924,ELAINE," Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged.  Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. ",81
44925,GREG," Oh good, there he is. I wanna be able to point him out.",81
44926,ELAINE," You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.",81
44927,GREG, Why?,81
44928,ELAINE," Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?",81
44929,GREG," Oh, I see...you're friends with the urinator, aren't you?",81
44930,ELAINE," Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.",81
44931,MARTY," Here you go, Mrs. Seinfeld...with your 25% discount, it comes to $17.80.",81
44932,MERYL," Here you go.  Excuse me, this isn't mine.",81
44933,MARTY," Oh, yes it is. Your husband brought it in himself.",81
44934,MERYL, Really?  Thank you. ,81
44935,ANNA, That's him! ,81
44936,MERYL , You son of a bitch!,81
44937,JERRY, I'm sorry.,81
44938,MERYL, Who is she? I want to know who she is.,81
44939,JERRY, It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.,81
44940,MERYL," A divorce? Oh, so you can marry her and give her the discount?",81
44941,JERRY," Yes, that's right.",81
44942,MERYL," What happened to us, Jerry?",81
44943,JERRY, I'll tell you what happened. We got married.,81
44944,MERYL," I'm sorry, uh.. this is my fault. I pushed it on you.",81
44945,JERRY, No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.,81
44946,MERYL," Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot......this is your maple syrup.",81
44947,JERRY," It's alright, I want you to have it.",81
44948,MERYL,"  Okay, thanks.",81
44949,JERRY, We'll always have...pancakes.,81
44950,MERYL," Bye, Jerry. ",81
44951,GRANDPA , I thought you said you was bringin' a white boy home! I don't see a white boy! I see a damn fool!,81
44952,JERRY,"I really feel as human beings, we need more training in our basic social skills. Conversational Distance, don't you hate these people that talk to you they talk into your mouth like you're a clown at a drive-through and Hand shakes is the worst, there's absolutely no guidelines for hand shakes you know these people? Too long, too weak, sometimes they give you the three-quarter handshake just the fingers, early release, late release, sometimes people will dispute your release, you let go there're hangin' on. I have actually said to people 'Hey the handshake is over!.' Too many pumps, coming in too high, too sweaty, coming from too far away. Sometimes a guy will give you a strong grip, late release, and pull you in for the too close conversation. To him I say 'That's three strikes you're out.'",82
44953,JERRY, You know their timing couldn't be worse.,82
44954,GEORGE, Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?,82
44955,JERRY," You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.",82
44956,GEORGE, When are they leaving for Paris?,82
44957,JERRY, Not for another three days.,82
44958,GEORGE, What about her place?,82
44959,JERRY, She lives with her parents.,82
44960,GEORGE," Really?  Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.",82
44961,JERRY,"  Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.",82
44962,GEORGE," Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?",82
44963,JERRY, The baldies,82
44964,GEORGE, Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.,82
44965,JERRY," That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.",82
44966,ALEC,  Hey guys.,82
44967,GEORGE, Hey Alec,82
44968,JERRY, Hey Alec,82
44969,ALEC, This is Joey.,82
44970,GEORGE," Hey Joey, how you doin'?",82
44971,ALEC,"  Hey listen, I was wondering if either one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother program? I'm kinda running the local chapter. What do you say George?",82
44972,GEORGE, Well uh....,82
44973,JOEY,  Wouldn't you like to be a big brother to someone like me? Please?,82
44974,GEORGE," Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.",82
44975,ALEC," That's great George, thanks a lot I'll get in touch with you.",82
44976,JOEY, Wouldn't you like to be a big brother..,82
44977,ALEC,"  Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go  See ya.",82
44978,JERRY, What happened?,82
44979,GEORGE, What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?,82
44980,JERRY,  Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?,82
44981,JERRY, Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?,82
44982,GEORGE, Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.,82
44983,JERRY," Ya, it's much better isn't it?",82
44984,GEORGE," Oh, n-no comparison.",82
44985,JERRY," Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.",82
44986,GEORGE,  Hey hey hey hey hey hey.,82
44987,JERRY, What?,82

44989,JERRY, Yea?,82
44990,GEORGE, So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.,82
44991,JERRY, What about little Joey?,82
44992,GEORGE, Who?,82
44993,JERRY," Ah, I think he's probably better off.",82
44994,GEORGE, I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris  all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.,82
44995,MORTY, But there are no stamps on these.,82
44996,GEORGE," Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps  I-I'll reimburse you of course.",82
44997,HELEN, Why are you doing this?,82
44998,JERRY, He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.,82
44999,HELEN, Why?,82
45000,JERRY, Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.,82
45001,KRAMER," Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?",82
45002,HELEN, I told you it was good. ,82
45003,KRAMER,  Ya,82

45009,KRAMER," Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.",82
45010,GEORGE," Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?",82
45011,KRAMER," Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.",82
45012,GEORGE," What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?",82
45013,KRAMER, Well I suppose the children do.,82
45014,GEORGE,  Yes I suppose they do.,82

45139,JERRY, The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.,82
45140,MORTY," I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.",82
45141,HELEN, Why would they? Know body bought them then.,82
45142,MORTY, He's wearing one.,82
45143,KRAMER, Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.,82
45144,MORTY, You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?,82
45145,KRAMER, Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.,82
45146,MORTY, You gotta deal.,82
45147,KRAMER, Yaaaa.,82
45148,JERRY, This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.,82
45149,MORTY," I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.",82
45150,HELEN, You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.,82
45151,MORTY, He'll send them express.,82
45152,HELEN, You're crazy.,82
45153,MORTY," I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.",82
45154,JERRY, N-na I'm paying for the trip.,82
45155,MORTY, So much the better.,82
45156,GEORGE, Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.,82
45157,ALEC, Paris huh?,82
45158,GEORGE," Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.",82
45159,ALEC, Where will you stay?,82
45160,GEORGE," An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.",82
45161,ALEC," George, you have no idea how fantastic this is.",82
45162,GEORGE, Fantastic?,82
45163,ALEC," Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, but he seems to take to you.  So it's a perfect solution.",82
45164,GEORGE, How gee what a coincidence.,82
45165,ALEC, And you'll send me a postcard.,82
45166,AARON, Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected to the way he painted children.,82
45167,ELAINE, Mm hmm.,82
45168,AARON," And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life.  He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him",82
45169,ELAINE, Aaron,82
45170,AARON, Yes?,82
45171,ELAINE," Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?",82
45172,AARON," Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy it.",82
45173,ELAINE," Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?",82
45174,AARON," No, it was fun.",82
45175,ELAINE, You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.,82
45176,AARON," Yea, they bought me a coke.",82
45177,KRAMER, So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?,82
45178,MORTY," I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys.  So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.",82
45179,KRAMER, How serendipitous.,82
45180,MORTY, So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.,82
45181,KRAMER, Mmm,82
45182,JERRY, He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized.  Alright come on let's play.,82
45183,KRAMER, Did you call Jack Klompus yet?,82
45184,MORTY, I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.,82
45185,JERRY, Ah come on.,82

45203,MORTY, I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.,82
45204,JACK, What's in the boxes?,82
45205,MORTY, Raincoats.,82
45206,JACK, Raincoats?  You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.,82
45207,HELEN, I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.,82
45208,JACK, When do you want these?,82
45209,MORTY, Send them tomorrow.,82
45210,ESTELLE, You think they're coming tonight?,82

45228,GEORGE, They will get a good home won't they?,82
45229,RUDY, Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.,82
45230,GEORGE," Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.",82
45231,RUDY, I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes.,82
45232,GEORGE, Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.,82

45263,GEORGE, Aaaa  aaaa  Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their  big plans!,82
45264,JERRY, What are you talking about?,82
45265,GEORGE, Mom and Pop Seinfeld,82

45271,GEORGE, Is there something wrong with my parents?,82

45281,GEORGE," It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.",82
45282,JERRY, I-I'll tell 'em,82
45283,GEORGE, Hey could you do one other thing for me?,82
45284,JERRY, Name it.,82
45285,GEORGE, You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them?  It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris.  Is that a coincidence?  Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going ,82
45286,JERRY," So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?",82
45287,GEORGE,  Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.,82
45288,JOANNE, So where's he taking you?,82

45455,ELAINE," N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?",82
45456,JERRY, It is a tad askew.,82
45457,ELAINE, I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?,82
45458,JERRY, I've hardly been out to dinner with them.,82
45459,ELAINE," See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.",82

45650,MR. GOLDSTEIN,"  You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful.

45676,FRANK, I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.,82
45677,ESTELLE, Ah forget about them let's just...,82
45678,JERRY,"To me, the thing about birthday parties is that the first birthday party you have and the last birthday party you have are actually quite similar. You know, you just kinda sit there...you're the least excited person at the party. You don't even really realize that there is a party. You don't know what's goin' on. Both birthday parties, people have to kinda help you blow out the candles, you can't do it...you don't even know why you're doing it. What is this ritual? What is going on? It's also the only two birthday parties where other people have to gather your friends together for you. Sometimes they're not even your friends. They make the judgement. They bring 'em in, they sit 'em down, and they tell you - 'these are your friends! Tell them thank you for coming to my birthday party.'",84
45679,TOBY ," These are great! Just great! Really great! Really, really great! Don't you think so, Elaine?",84
45680,ELAINE ," Yeah, really great.",84
45681,TOBY," Oh, a coffee table book about coffee tables!  How did you come up with this idea?",84
45682,KRAMER, It was there!,84
45683,TOBY," Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!' ",84
45684,ELAINE," You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...",84
45685,KRAMER," Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?",84
45686,TOBY," Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great!",84
45687,ELAINE ," 'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from ""The Price Is Right""! ",84
45688,JERRY," Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny -  ""Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest.""",84
45689,ELAINE ," Yeah, it's funny, I dunno.",84
45690,JERRY," You don't know? Come on, that's gold!",84
45691,ELAINE," Well, I don't know about ""gold.""",84
45692,JERRY," Oh, that's gold, baby.",84

45694,JERRY, I was saying 'baby' way before George!,84

45696,JERRY," Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.",84
45697,ELAINE," Yeah, who's he?",84
45698,JERRY, He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.,84

45719,JERRY," Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!",84
45720,GEORGE," Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food!  He's suckin' down Equal packets!",84
45721,ROBIN, Do you think 25 kids is too much?,84
45722,GEORGE," 25 kids for his birthday party?  Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets. ",84
45723,ROBIN," So, what about entertainment?  Should I get Barney?",84
45724,KID, No Barney!,84
45725,ROBIN , Maybe a clown.,84
45726,GEORGE, How about Bozo?,84
45727,KID, Who's Bozo?,84

45733,ROBIN," George! Forget Bozo, George. Bozo's out. He's finished. It's over for Bozo.",84
45734,GEORGE," You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...",84
45735,FRANK," Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!",84
45736,ESTELLE," Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!",84
45737,FRANK, Blow out the candles!!,84
45738,ROBIN," Well, this time, you can blow out the candles.",84
45739,GEORGE," Nah, I have asthma. ",84
45740,TOBY, Hi!,84
45741,ELAINE ," Hi, Toby.",84
45742,TOBY, How are you doing today?,84
45743,ELAINE, Fine...  How are you?,84
45744,TOBY," Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear about Bob Rosen?",84
45745,ELAINE, Nope.,84
45746,TOBY, He is going to Knopp. He is going to be a vice president.,84
45747,ELAINE," Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?",84
45748,TOBY, No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house.,84
45749,ELAINE, Really!?,84
45750,TOBY, Maybe it'll be you!,84
45751,ELAINE, Oh...well...,84
45752,TOBY," You really deserve it. I mean, you have experience, seniority...Lippman really respects your opinion...",84
45753,ELAINE ," Well! Well, it could be you.",84
45754,TOBY, No...,84
45755,ELAINE," No, really.",84
45756,TOBY , Really? You think so?,84
45757,ELAINE , Sure.,84
45758,TOBY," Boy, wouldn't that be exciting!",84
45759,ELAINE," I mean, stranger things have happened...",84
45760,TOBY, Wow! Me! A senior editor!  I'd like that.,84
45761,ELAINE," Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.",84
45762,TOBY," Well, it's a possibility, like you said! Stranger things have happened! Thank you, Elaine. Thank you. ",84
45763,JERRY," Hey, Ronnie.",84
45764,RONNIE, Hey.,84
45765,JERRY,  Can I have a club soda?  Goin' on tonight?,84
45766,RONNIE, Yeah. You?,84
45767,JERRY, Yeah.,84
45768,RONNIE, You know Leonard Christian's here?,84
45769,JERRY," Yeah, I know.",84
45770,RONNIE, Can I ask you something? Are my nostrils getting bigger?,84
45771,JERRY,  I don't...think so.,84
45772,RONNIE, Are you sure? Take a good look. They seem a little bigger?,84
45773,JERRY, I don't...I dunno.,84
45774,RONNIE, Is it possible for nostrils to expand?,84
45775,JERRY," Oh, is this a bit?",84
45776,RONNIE," Hey, I don't do ""bits."" I'm a prop comic. Dammit, I can't find my water gun. I can't go on without my water gun.",84
45777,KRAMER," Hey, Jerry.",84
45778,JERRY,  Hey.,84
45779,KRAMER," Well here's Toby,  Jerry.",84
45780,TOBY," This is so exciting! Look, I have goosebumps!  Touch! Touch them!  I've never been to a comedy club before!",84
45781,JERRY," Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.",84
45782,TOBY , You are so funny!,84
45783,JERRY," Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.",84
45784,TOBY," Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. I believe you! Oh, he's so funny! ",84
45785,KRAMER, What about me?,84
45786,TOBY ," What about you?  I'm only kidding. You're funny, too. I love to laugh.",84
45787,JERRY," Good, good.",84
45788,KRAMER ," So, you up next?",84
45789,JERRY," Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?",84
45790,TOBY," Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot.' ",84
45791,KRAMER," Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?",84
45792,JERRY, Yeah.,84
45793,TOBY," Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show!",84
45794,JERRY," O.k., good, I'll see you later. ",84
45795,TOBY," Oh, he's so great! This is so great! I'm so excited!",84
45796,JERRY, Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...,84
45797,TOBY ," Oh, really! Really! That is so true!",84
45798,JERRY," Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.",84
45799,TOBY, Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on! ,84
45800,JERRY , See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...,84
45801,TOBY," Oh, that is so true, yes!",84
45802,JERRY, ...that's why men hunt and women nest.,84
45803,TOBY, BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo! ,84
45804,JERRY," Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.",84
45805,KRAMER, Hey.,84
45806,JERRY," Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!",84
45807,KRAMER," Look, she didn't mean anything.",84
45808,JERRY," Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!",84
45809,KRAMER," She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!",84
45810,JERRY, Hey! What is wrong with you?!,84
45811,TOBY, Me? Nothing's wrong with me.,84
45812,JERRY, Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!,84
45813,TOBY," Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show.",84
45814,JERRY, No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!,84
45815,TOBY," Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it in this business if you can't take it?",84
45816,JERRY," Oh, I can take it.",84
45817,TOBY , Let's go. ,84
45818,RONNIE," Hey, man. Good set.",84
45819,GEORGE, Bozo?,84
45820,ERIC, No.,84
45821,GEORGE, B-O-Z-O?,84
45822,ERIC," Sorry, I...",84
45823,GEORGE, You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?,84
45824,ERIC, No!,84
45825,GEORGE, How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?,84
45826,ERIC," I don't know, I just don't.",84
45827,GEORGE, How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?,84
45828,ERIC," Hey, man - what are you hassling me for? This is just a gig, it's not my life. I don't know who Bozo is, what - is he a clown?",84
45829,GEORGE," Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?",84
45830,ERIC," Well, what is he?",84
45831,GEORGE," Yes, he's a clown!",84
45832,ERIC," Alright, so what's the big deal! There's millions of clowns!",84
45833,GEORGE," Alright, just forget it.",84
45834,ERIC," Me forget it? You should forget it! You're livin' in the past, man! You're hung up on some clown from the sixties, man!",84
45835,GEORGE," Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric!  What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?",84
45836,GEORGE," Well, I do what I can. ",84
45837,ROBIN," Hi Mom, how's everything?",84
45838,ROBIN, The burgers should be ready in a minute.,84
45839,GEORGE," Ah, great, great.  What's that smell? Smoke?  Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here... FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!",84
45840,GEORGE , It was an inferno in there! An inferno! ,84
45841,ERIC, There he is! That's him! ,84
45842,GEORGE , I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.,84
45843,ROBIN," But you yelled ""get out of my way""!",84
45844,GEORGE," Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?",84
45845,ROBIN," But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out, you left everyone behind!",84
45846,GEORGE," Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?",84
45847,FIREMAN, How do you live with yourself?,84
45848,GEORGE, Its not easy.,84
45849,GEORGE, So she doesn't want to see me anymore.,84
45850,JERRY," Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?",84
45851,GEORGE," No, her too. And her mother.",84
45852,JERRY, Really? Her mother.,84
45853,GEORGE," Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.",84
45854,JERRY, You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.,84
45855,GEORGE, Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.,84
45856,JERRY," Hmm. So you feel ""women and children first,"" in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.",84
45857,GEORGE, To some degree.,84
45858,JERRY," So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.",84
45859,GEORGE, In a manner of speaking.,84
45860,JERRY," Yeah, well, it's honest.",84
45861,GEORGE, Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.,84
45862,JERRY," Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.",84
45863,GEORGE, Perhaps.,84
45864,JERRY," So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?",84
45865,GEORGE, Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.,84
45866,JERRY," By the way, did you see this? ",84
45867,GEORGE, What's that?,84
45868,JERRY," It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.",84
45869,GEORGE," Wow, he really does a number on you.  ""Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling.""",84
45870,JERRY, I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.,84
45871,GEORGE, You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.,84
45872,JERRY," Yeah, right.",84
45873,GEORGE," You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'",84
45874,JERRY," Yeah, that'd be something.",84
45875,GEORGE," I'm not kidding, you should do it.",84
45876,JERRY, But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.,84
45877,GEORGE," Well, go ahead! Do it!",84
45878,JERRY, Why can't I?,84
45879,GEORGE, No reason!,84
45880,JERRY," You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!",84
45881,GEORGE, This is unprecedented!,84
45882,JERRY," There's no precedent, baby!",84
45883,GEORGE, What...are you using my babies now?,84
45884,JERRY," Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'",84
45885,TOBY," You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!",84
45886,JERRY," Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?",84
45887,TOBY," Well, how would you like it if I called security?",84
45888,JERRY," Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!",84
45889,TOBY," No,  that's it.  Get out of the way.",84
45890,KRAMER," Hey, what's going on?",84
45891,JERRY, Boo!,84
45892,KRAMER, What's happenin' here?,84
45893,JERRY, Hiss!,84
45894,KRAMER,  Toby! Toby!,84
45895,TOBY,  My pinky toe!,84
45896,KRAMER,"  Toby!  Oh, Oh!",84
45897,KRAMER, What did you go up there to heckle her for?,84
45898,JERRY, Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! ,84
45899,KRAMER," Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.",84
45900,JERRY," Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.",84
45901,GEORGE, What accident?,84
45902,KRAMER," Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.",84
45903,GEORGE, That's unbelievable!,84
45904,KRAMER," Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.",84
45905,GEORGE, Wha.. you ran?,84
45906,KRAMER," No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, ""I got a toe here, buddy - step on it.""",84
45907,GEORGE, Holy cow!,84
45908,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, ""Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?"" I said, ""Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - ""  - knocked him out cold!",84
45909,GEORGE, How could you do that?!,84
45910,KRAMER," Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.",84
45911,GEORGE, You're Batman.,84
45912,KRAMER," Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.",84
45913,JERRY, You kept makin' all the stops?,84
45914,KRAMER," Well, people kept ringin' the bell!",84
45915,GEORGE," Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?",84
45916,KRAMER, Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.,84
45917,GEORGE, You did all this...for a pinky toe?,84
45918,KRAMER," Well, it's a valuable appendage.",84
45919,JOANNE," So, Kramer found the toe, and they re-attached it.",84
45920,ELAINE, Really.,84
45921,JOANNE," Yea, poor kid. What an ordeal.",84
45922,MICHAEL, And you know how extremely sensitive she is?,84
45923,ELAINE, I know.,84
45924,MICHAEL, She's gonna need our full support.,84
45925,ELAINE ," Yeah, right.",84
45926,MICHAEL," Toby, what can I do? Can I get you something?",84
45927,TOBY," Oh no, no thank you.",84
45928,MICHAEL, Toby please let us help. We're family.,84
45929,TOBY," Oh well, I could use some coffee.",84
45930,JERRY, She got the promotion?,84
45931,ELAINE , Yep.,84
45932,JERRY, Why?,84
45933,ELAINE," I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.",84
45934,JERRY, Too bad.,84
45935,ELAINE," Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?",84
45936,JERRY," Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'",84
45937,ELAINE, Why don't you just shut the f-,84
45938,KRAMER ," Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!",84
45939,ELAINE," Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??",84
45940,KRAMER," Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.",84
45941,ELAINE," Oh, wonderful!",84
45942,KRAMER," You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.",84
45943,ELAINE," Oh, of course! She's deranged.",84
45944,JERRY," I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.",84
45945,RONNIE, I heard you went down to somebody's office and heckled them?,84
45946,JERRY, Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!,84
45947,RONNIE," How could you do that? I mean, everybody's talking about it.",84
45948,JERRY," Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.",84
45949,RONNIE," Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks. You opened the door for all of us. I can't wait till the next time someone heckles me.",84
45950,JERRY," Yeah, well, it won't be long.",84
45951,ANNOUNCER," Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jerry Seinfeld!",84
45952,JERRY, Gotta go. ,84
45953,GEORGE, Robin? Robin!,84
45954,ROBIN," George, what is it? I'm working.",84
45955,GEORGE," Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.",84
45956,ROBIN, What are you talking about?,84
45957,GEORGE, O.k....,84
45958,JERRY," I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need ""the clown"" in his title, as clown? Bozo, ""the"" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...",84
45959,GEORGE," ...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.",84
45960,ROBIN," L-listen, Listen...I gotta think about this. ",84
45961,GEORGE," Alright, but I'm serious about this.",84
45962,RONNIE ," Alright, hand it over man!",84
45963,JERRY, ...that's why men hunt and women nest.,84
45964,GEORGE , He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Get out of the way! ,84
45965,ROBIN, George! This is Ronnie Kaye!,84
45966,GEORGE," The prop comic?  Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?",84
45967,RONNIE , Nostrils.,84
45968,JERRY, George - could I have a word?,84
45969,JERRY,"I find the human fascination with water is amazing. We're constantly going to beaches, pools, lakes, rivers, we're swimming, we're snorkeling, we're-we're scuba diving, we bathe in it, our bodies are mostly made of water, everyone is caring around these bottles of water. We can't get enough water, unless it rains then we're like, ""Oh, look I'm soaked. I am literally drenched."" For some reason we have a huge problem with small flying water. I-It'll just stop us right in our tracks. ""Uh, I felt a drop, We're gonna get caught in it! Everyone cover your water bottles, run!!""													 ",85
45970,KRAMER," All right, get off at the next exit.",85
45971,JERRY," Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.",85
45972,KRAMER," It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.",85
45973,JERRY,  You sure we're makin' the right move?,85
45974,ELAINE," We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.",85
45975,JERRY, Didn't they just have a baby?,85
45976,ELAINE," That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'",85
45977,JERRY, Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?,85
45978,KRAMER," Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?",85
45979,JERRY, No.,85
45980,KRAMER, Put that on the top of your list.,85
45981,JERRY," No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.",85
45982,ELAINE," Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?",85
45983,JERRY," I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.",85
45984,ELAINE, When's Rachel comin' out?,85
45985,JERRY, She's makin' the three o'clock train.,85
45986,ELAINE," Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.",85
45987,JERRY, I bought him some kishka.,85
45988,KRAMER, What's that?,85
45989,JERRY," It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.",85
45990,GEORGE, I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.,85
45991,JANE, Me too. I love cough medicine.,85
45992,GEORGE," You see? We were made for each other.  It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.",85
45993,JANE, What's your favorite?,85
45994,GEORGE, Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?,85
45995,JANE, No.,85
45996,GEORGE," Oh, very refreshing.  Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.",85
45997,JANE, Are we almost there?,85
45998,GEORGE," Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.",85

46002,KRAMER, Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.,85
46003,JERRY," Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?",85
46004,KRAMER," Come on, I'll rub some on yours.",85
46005,JERRY," No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.",85
46006,GEORGE,"  You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.",85
46007,JANE,  You must've been excited.,85
46008,GEORGE," Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?",85
46009,JANE, I don't think so.,85
46010,GEORGE," 'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?",85

46016,JERRY, No lines.,85
46017,ELAINE, You know why? One word,85
46018,JERRY, So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?,85
46019,ELAINE, I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.,85
46020,KRAMER," I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?",85
46021,ELAINE,  No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.,85
46022,JERRY,  Oh this is interesting.,85
46023,ELAINE, What?,85
46024,JERRY, Jane's topless. ,85
46025,KRAMER, Yo yo ma.,85

46028,CAROL," Come on, you guys. You can come and see the bay-bee!",85
46029,JERRY," Oh, in a minute, Carol.",85
46030,KRAMER, We're gonna be right there.,85
46031,JERRY, This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.,85
46032,ELAINE, Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?,85
46033,KRAMER, Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.,85
46034,ELAINE, What?,85
46035,KRAMER," You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.",85
46036,JERRY," Oh, here she comes. ",85
46037,JANE, I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink?,85
46038,JERRY, No thanks.,85
46039,ELAINE, I'm good.,85
46040,KRAMER," Deh-deh-deh-deh-  All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach.",85
46041,CAROL," Adam , Jerry and Elaine are here.",85
46042,ELAINE," Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby.",85
46043,CAROL, Isn't he gorgeous? ,85
46044,ELAINE, Ugghh.,85
46045,CAROL, Is she gorgeous? ,85
46046,ELAINE," Oh, gorgeous, yes.",85
46047,JERRY, So very gorgeous.,85
46048,CAROL," Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in.",85
46049,JERRY, Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?,85
46050,ELAINE," Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.",85
46051,JERRY," Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool.  And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.",85
46052,ELAINE," Oh, you have to lie.",85
46053,JERRY, It's a must lie situation.,85
46054,ELAINE," Yes, it's a must lie situation.",85
46055,JERRY," You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.",85
46056,ELAINE," No, I don't think so.",85
46057,JERRY, In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.,85
46058,KRAMER," Oooh, lobsters.",85
46059,BEN, Oh this ointment should do it.,85
46060,CAROL," How are you feeling, Adam?  Elaine!  This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa.",85
46061,ELAINE, Hi.,85
46062,CAROL," Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?",85
46063,ELAINE,  Pretty gorgeous.,85
46064,BEN," Elaine, you have children?",85
46065,ELAINE," Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.",85
46066,BEN, A beautiful woman like you should. You're quite breathtaking.,85
46067,ELAINE, Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?,85
46068,CAROL," And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?",85
46069,BEN," Uh, Sure. ",85
46070,JERRY," Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.",85
46071,ELAINE," Yeah, see ya.",85
46072,JERRY, Okay. ,85
46073,CAROL," Oh, just look at him!",85
46074,BEN," Yeah, he really is breathtaking. ",85
46075,RACHEL, Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way.,85
46076,JERRY, Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. ,85
46077,GEORGE, Hey Rachel!,85
46078,RACHEL,  Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change.,85
46079,GEORGE, What kind of a greeting was that?,85
46080,JERRY, She's got greeting problems.,85
46081,GEORGE," Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.",85
46082,JERRY," Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. ",85
46083,KRAMER," Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!",85
46084,GEORGE," Hey! Wow, the K-Man! ",85
46085,JERRY, You got lobster for everybody?,85
46086,KRAMER," Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.",85
46087,GEORGE," This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...",85
46088,KRAMER," I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. ",85
46089,GEORGE," You saw who, what?",85
46090,KRAMER," Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.",85
46091,JERRY,  All right.,85
46092,GEORGE, You saw Jane topless?,85
46093,JERRY," Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.",85
46094,GEORGE, Oh you mean face down on her chest.,85
46095,JERRY, No.,85
46096,GEORGE, Face up on her back?,85
46097,JERRY, Yeah.,85
46098,GEORGE, Well why'd she do that?,85
46099,KRAMER, I guess she was hot.,85
46100,GEORGE, You mean she just laid there topless?,85
46101,KRAMER," No, no, she got up, she walked around...",85
46102,GEORGE, Walked around? And you looked?,85
46103,KRAMER," Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.",85
46104,GEORGE, I can't believe that you saw her before me.,85
46105,JERRY, Think of me as a doctor. ,85
46106,GEORGE," Well, how good a look did you get?",85
46107,JERRY, Well what'd you mean?,85
46108,GEORGE," Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...",85
46109,JERRY, They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.,85
46110,GEORGE," Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.",85
46111,JERRY,  I guess that's true...,85
46112,GEORGE," Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.",85
46113,JERRY, What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?,85
46114,GEORGE," Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.",85
46115,JERRY, You can see me naked. I can offer you that.,85
46116,GEORGE, It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.,85
46117,ELAINE, Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.,85
46118,JERRY, I've never been called breathtaking either.,85
46119,ELAINE," I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?",85
46120,JERRY, Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.,85
46121,ELAINE," Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.",85
46122,JERRY, How are you gonna do that?,85
46123,ELAINE, I can be very clever.,85
46124,RACHEL, I'm gonna take a swim.,85
46125,ELAINE," Oh, me too. I'll meet you down.  Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.",85
46126,GEORGE," Oh, okay. ",85
46127,RACHEL, Hey!,85
46128,GEORGE," Oh, sorry.",85
46129,RACHEL, Don't you knock?,85
46130,GEORGE," I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.",85
46131,JERRY, You might have.,85
46132,GEORGE, I didn't.,85
46133,JERRY, You won't.,85
46134,RACHEL," What'd you want anyway, George?",85
46135,JERRY," Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?",85
46136,GEORGE," No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.",85
46137,JERRY," Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.",85
46138,GEORGE," Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.",85
46139,RACHEL, We don't have any gum.,85
46140,GEORGE, Okay.  Thanks anyway. ,85
46141,RACHEL, Strange man.,85
46142,JERRY, Wait'll you get to know him.,85
46143,RACHEL," So where is this baby, anyway?",85
46144,JERRY," Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. ",85
46145,RACHEL,"  Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry. ",85
46146,GEORGE,  I was in the pool! I was in the pool!,85
46147,GEORGE, Did she do it on purpose?,85
46148,JERRY," It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.",85
46149,GEORGE, I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.,85
46150,JERRY, So what?,85
46151,GEORGE, Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...,85
46152,JERRY, But...,85
46153,GEORGE, Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...,85
46154,JERRY, Oh... You mean... shrinkage.,85
46155,GEORGE, Yes. Significant shrinkage.,85
46156,JERRY, So you feel you were short changed.,85
46157,GEORGE," Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.",85
46158,JERRY," Well, so what's the difference?",85
46159,GEORGE, What if she discusses it with Jane?,85
46160,JERRY," Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.",85
46161,GEORGE, How do you know?,85
46162,JERRY, Women aren't like us.,85
46163,GEORGE," They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?",85
46164,JERRY," No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.",85
46165,GEORGE, How do women know about shrinkage?,85
46166,JERRY, Isn't it common knowledge?,85
46167,GEORGE, Do women know about shrinkage?,85
46168,ELAINE," What do you mean, like laundry?",85
46169,GEORGE, No.,85
46170,JERRY, Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...,85
46171,ELAINE, It shrinks?,85
46172,JERRY, Like a frightened turtle!,85
46173,ELAINE, Why does it shrink?,85
46174,GEORGE, It just does.,85
46175,ELAINE, I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.,85
46176,MICHAEL," Thanks for the lobster, Kramer.",85
46177,KRAMER," Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?",85
46178,RACHEL," Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.",85
46179,KRAMER, You mean you've never tasted lobster?,85
46180,RACHEL, No.,85
46181,KRAMER," Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.",85
46182,CAROL," Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us.",85
46183,JERRY," No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.",85
46184,ELAINE," Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.",85
46185,JERRY," Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.",85
46186,CAROL, I'm gonna get him.,85
46187,GEORGE," See, look at this.  Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.",85
46188,ELAINE," Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. ",85
46189,GEORGE," What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?",85
46190,JANE," It's nothing, George.",85
46191,GEORGE," You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?",85
46192,JANE, What is it with you?,85
46193,JERRY,  Easy big fella.,85
46194,MICHAEL," So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the Fleesher's Market?",85
46195,KRAMER," No, I got 'em in the ocean.",85
46196,MICHAEL, The ocean? What'd you mean?,85
46197,KRAMER," Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.",85
46198,MICHAEL, Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those lobsters from there. That's against the law.,85
46199,KRAMER, Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.,85
46200,MICHAEL, My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at four and came home every night stinking of brine! He sent me through law school with the lobsters he caught! ,85
46201,CAROL,  Here he is.,85
46202,KRAMER, Ahhh! ,85
46203,ELAINE," Some night, huh?",85
46204,BEN," Yeah, I wish I had my telescope.",85
46205,ELAINE," Some dinner, huh?",85
46206,BEN, Nothing like fresh caught lobster.,85
46207,ELAINE," Some house, huh?",85
46208,BEN, It was built by Mark Fargman. He build a lot of these homes here.,85
46209,ELAINE," Some ugly baby, huh?",85
46210,BEN, What did you say?,85
46211,ELAINE,"  I said, uh, some snuggly baby.",85
46212,BEN, He is something.,85
46213,ELAINE," Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.",85
46214,BEN," Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be nice. ",85
46215,JERRY, You told her?,85
46216,RACHEL," Yeah, what's the big deal?",85
46217,JERRY," You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.",85
46218,RACHEL," Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.",85
46219,GEORGE, You're going back to New York now?,85
46220,JANE," Yeah, I have some things to do.",85
46221,GEORGE," Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.",85
46222,JANE, So what if I did?,85
46223,GEORGE, And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?,85
46224,JANE, I don't know what you're talking about.,85
46225,GEORGE," *I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!",85
46226,JANE,  I'm sure it is.,85
46227,GEORGE," Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage.",85
46228,KRAMER, You looking for this? ,85
46229,RACHEL," Oh, Kramer! You startled me.",85
46230,KRAMER," Well, I thought you might wind up around here.",85
46231,RACHEL," Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much an' well I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?",85
46232,KRAMER, No I'm afraid I couldn't do that.,85
46233,RACHEL, Why not?,85
46234,KRAMER," Well, that wouldn't be kosher.",85
46235,RACHEL," C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.",85
46236,KRAMER," Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.",85
46237,RACHEL," Come on, Kramer.",85
46238,KRAMER, Heyahhh!,85
46239,RACHEL, I just heard a car drive out. What was that?,85
46240,JERRY," Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. ",85
46241,CAROL," George, thanks so much for making breakfast.",85
46242,ELAINE," George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.",85
46243,KRAMER, Ya I didn't know you could cook.,85
46244,GEORGE," Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.",85
46245,BEN," Yes, George, the whole breakfast is breathtaking. ",85
46246,RACHEL, Good morning.,85
46247,ALL," Hey, hey. Morning",85
46248,RACHEL," Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really saved me.",85
46249,MICHAEL, What happened?,85
46250,RACHEL," Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.",85
46251,KRAMER, Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.,85
46252,RACHEL," You're right, I would have.",85
46253,JERRY,"  Hey, look at this guy.",85
46254,GEORGE, A little breakfast.,85
46255,JERRY, Yeah.,85
46256,GEORGE,"  And, uh, you eat eggs, right?",85
46257,RACHEL," Yes, I do. Thank you.",85
46258,JERRY," Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?",85
46259,RACHEL, Umm... This is so good.,85
46260,GEORGE," Ah, enjoying them?",85
46261,RACHEL, Mm-hmm.,85
46262,GEORGE," Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. ",85
46263,RACHEL, There's lobster in these eggs?,85
46264,GEORGE," Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.",85
46265,JERRY," Well, I guess I gotta go, too.",85
46266,ELAINE," Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. ",85
46267,MICHAEL, Excuse me?,85
46268,POLICE," I'm sorry to bother you, but we're trying to track down a lobster poacher that uh cleaned out on of the traps.",85
46269,KRAMER, Wonder what's goin' on.,85
46270,GEORGE," Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.",85
46271,MICHAEL," There he is, officer. ",85
46272,RACHEL, Ahh! Don't you ever knock?,85
46273,GEORGE, I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.,85
46274,ELAINE," Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.",85
46275,JERRY, I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.,85
46276,ELAINE, How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?,85
46277,JERRY, They got some sort of program.,85
46278,GEORGE," Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.",85
46279,JERRY," Hey, isn't that Michael's car?",85
46280,ELAINE, There's Rachel.,85
46281,GEORGE, Where? ,85
46282,MR. LIPPMAN, To your promotion.,86
46283,ELAINE," Oh, thank you!  Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.",86
46284,MR. LIPPMAN," Well, you're really on your way now.",86
46285,ELAINE, You really oughtta do something about that cold.,86
46286,JERRY, You got a raise?,86
46287,ELAINE," I don't fool around,  baby!",86
46288,JERRY, I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.,86
46289,ELAINE," They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.",86
46290,JERRY," Oh, when did that happen?",86
46291,ELAINE, They're signing the papers next week.,86
46292,JERRY, Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?,86
46293,ELAINE," Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.",86
46294,JERRY," Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.",86
46295,ELAINE," Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.",86
46296,JERRY," Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen ""Girlie"" Brown would be very proud of you.",86
46297,JERRY, Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?,86
46298,GEORGE, I went to the beach. ,86
46299,JERRY," Oh, the beach.",86
46300,GEORGE," It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. ",86
46301,JERRY, What is it that isn't working?,86
46302,GEORGE," Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright.  Oh, maybe not academically speaking,  I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.",86
46303,JERRY,  Could I get napkin over there?,86
46304,GEORGE," It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong.  Everywhere.",86
46305,WAITRESS ," Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.",86
46306,GEORGE," Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. ",86
46307,ELAINE," Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.",86
46308,JERRY," You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current,  and the tuna swim with it. ",86
46309,GEORGE,  Good for the tuna.,86
46310,ELAINE," Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.",86
46311,GEORGE, So what? What am I supposed to do?,86
46312,ELAINE, Go talk to her.,86
46313,GEORGE," Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.",86
46314,JERRY," Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.",86
46315,GEORGE," Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.",86
46316,JERRY," If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.",86
46317,GEORGE," Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!",86
46318,GEORGE," Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.",86
46319,VICTORIA," Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me.",86
46320,GEORGE, My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.,86
46321,VICTORIA, I'm Victoria. Hi.,86
46322,JERRY,"  Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. ",86
46323,KRAMER," Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!",86
46324,JERRY, What's happening?,86
46325,KRAMER, The coffee table book. It's a go-oo!,86
46326,JERRY," Oh yeah, I heard all about it.",86
46327,KRAMER, You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop ,86
46328,JERRY, You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?,86
46329,KRAMER," Oh, you better believe it!",86
46330,JERRY, I'll loan you my puffy shirt.,86
46331,KRAMER," No, no, no.",86
46332,JERRY, What're you gonna talk about?,86
46333,KRAMER," Well, coffee tables.",86
46334,JERRY," Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye.  You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.",86
46335,KRAMER, You know who you are? Even Steven,86
46336,VICTORIA, Are you growing a beard?,86
46337,GEORGE, Why shave every day? It just grows right back.,86
46338,VICTORIA, I guess ...,86
46339,GEORGE," I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.",86
46340,VICTORIA," Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!",86
46341,GEORGE, Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.,86
46342,VICTORIA, What are we gonna do? Should we just move?,86
46343,GEORGE, That won't be necessary.,86
46344,GEORGE," Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!",86
46345,VICTORIA," Are you sure you don't wanna come up, I mean, it's only nine thirty.",86
46346,GEORGE, I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.,86
46347,VICTORIA," Who are you, George Costanza?",86
46348,GEORGE, I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.,86
46349,THEATER MANAGER," Excuse me, is your name Elaine?",86
46350,ELAINE, Yes.,86
46351,THEATER MANAGER, Were you suposed to meet a Jake Jarmal here?,86
46352,ELAINE, Yeah.,86
46353,THEATER MANAGER," Well, I'm afraid he's been in an accident.",86
46354,ELAINE,  An accident? What happened?,86
46355,THEATER MANAGER," Well-he got side-swiped by a cab, but he's alright. He's in St.Vincent Hospital, room 907.",86
46356,ELAINE, Oh. Ok. Thank you.,86
46357,ELAINE, Could I have a box of Jujyfruits?,86
46358,COUNTERPERSON,  There you go.,86
46359,JAKE," So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.",86
46360,ELAINE,"  Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.",86
46361,ELAINE, You want one?,86
46362,JAKE, No thanks.,86
46363,ELAINE, So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?,86
46364,JAKE, Where did you get those?,86
46365,ELAINE, At the movies.,86
46366,JAKE, Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?,86
46367,ELAINE," Yeah, he did.",86
46368,JAKE, Then when did you get those?,86
46369,ELAINE, Right after ... that ...,86
46370,JAKE," So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?",86
46371,ELAINE," Well... the counter...was right there, and...",86
46372,JAKE," I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.",86
46373,ELAINE," No, no, it does!",86
46374,JAKE,"  If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!",86
46375,ELAINE, But...Jake...,86
46376,JAKE," I would like to be alone now, please.",86
46377,ELAINE," But, Jake, I didn't...",86
46378,JAKE, Goodnight!,86
46379,JERRY,  Broke even.,86

46387,KATHY LEE, I did.,86
46388,REGIS," I mean, he looks like a fun guy, doesn't he?",86
46389,KATHY LEE, I love his hair.,86
46390,REGIS," Yeah, oh, I do too. This guy could be a little bonkos. Really. Anyway, if you will, would you please welcome",86
46391,REGIS,"  Hello, Kramer is here.",86
46392,KATHY LEE," I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something!",86
46393,REGIS," Ah, well, yes Kramer. So, a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where did you come up with this idea?",86
46394,KRAMER," Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.",86
46395,REGIS," You know, when I'm skiing, Kramer, I'm trying not to kill myself, you're writing books!",86
46396,KRAMER," Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!",86
46397,KATHY LEE," Have you always had an interest in coffee tables, because, really, I-I love coffee tables, and I-I thought I was the only one.",86
46398,KRAMER," You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.",86
46399,KATHY LEE, Is that fabulous?,86
46400,REGIS, Look at this!,86
46401,KATHY LEE, Is that fabulous?,86
46402,REGIS, Fabulous!,86
46403,KATHY LEE, I want one of these.,86
46404,REGIS, Did I tell you this guy was bonkos?,86
46405,KATHY LEE, This coffee table  is full of pictures of celebrities' coffee tables.,86
46406,KRAMER, That's true. That's right.,86
46407,REGIS," Yeah? Well, I'm not in there. Where's mine?",86
46408,KRAMER," Oh, it's on file, right here. ",86
46409,REGIS," I'm tellin' ya, this guy's bonkos! He really is!",86

46415,ELAINE," Yeah, it got pretty nasty.",86
46416,JERRY, And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?,86
46417,ELAINE, It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.,86
46418,JERRY, Why didn't you eat it in the cab?,86
46419,ELAINE," Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.",86
46420,ELAINE, What's all this?,86
46421,JERRY, Played cards last night.,86
46422,ELAINE, Oh yeah? How'd you do?,86
46423,JERRY, Broke even.,86
46424,ELAINE, You always break even.,86
46425,JERRY," Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!",86
46426,ELAINE, Do you have twenty bucks?,86
46427,JERRY, What for?,86
46428,ELAINE, Just gimme twenty bucks.,86
46429,JERRY,  What the hell was that?,86
46430,ELAINE, Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.,86
46431,JERRY, You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.,86
46432,ELAINE," You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -",86
46433,JERRY," Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.",86
46434,GEORGE," Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -",86
46435,JERRY, Bad.,86
46436,GEORGE, Day was -,86
46437,ELAINE, Night.,86
46438,GEORGE, Yes!,86
46439,JERRY, So you just did the opposite of everything?,86
46440,GEORGE," Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.",86
46441,JERRY, So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.,86
46442,GEORGE, Yes funny  let's go.,86
46443,JERRY, Elaine ... look! A twenty!,86
46444,ELAINE,  Oh my God.,86

46448,MR. LIPPMAN," Uh, Ya, Have a seat.",86
46449,KRAMER, Al-righty  Have you got yourself a cold?,86
46450,KRAMER," Woah, that's quite a honk!",86
46451,MR. LIPPMAN," Ya, thank you.",86
46452,KRAMER, Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.,86
46453,MR. LIPPMAN," The reason I asked you in here, is I-I caught your appearance on uh ""Regis and Kathy Lee"" the other day and -",86
46454,KRAMER," Ya that was pretty good, huh?",86
46455,MR. LIPPMAN," An-Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best i-if you uh didn't do any more of these shows.",86
46456,KRAMER, Because of the coffee thing?,86
46457,MR. LIPPMAN," Kramer, I'm sorry.",86
46458,KRAMER," What about ""Sonia Live""? Now you're not cancelling ""Sonia Live""?",86
46459,MR. LIPPMAN, It's out -,86
46460,KRAMER," She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.",86
46461,MR. LIPPMAN," Kra-Kramer, I -",86
46462,MR. CUSHMAN, Why don't you tell me about some of your previous work experience?,86
46463,GEORGE, Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.,86
46464,MR. CUSHMAN, Go on.,86
46465,GEORGE," Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.",86
46466,MR. CUSHMAN, Do you talk to everybody like this?,86
46467,GEORGE, Of course.,86
46468,MR. CUSHMAN, My niece told me you were different.,86
46469,GEORGE," I am different, yeah.",86
46470,MR. CUSHMAN," I gotta tell ya, you are the complete opposite of every applicant we've seen.  Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, sir. There's someone here I'd like you to meet.  This is Mr. Costanza. He's one of the applicants.",86
46471,MR. STEINBRENNER, Nice to meet you.,86
46472,GEORGE," Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!",86
46473,MR. STEINBRENNER, Hire this man!,86
46474,SECRETARY, Tina Robbins is here to see you.,86
46475,MAN, Who's that?,86

46481,ELAINE," So, I haven't seen you in a while.",86
46482,TINA," Elaine, we have a problem.",86
46483,ELAINE," Well, what is it?",86
46484,TINA, You're getting kicked out.,86
46485,ELAINE, Kicked out?! Why?!,86
46486,TINA," Well, there's been a number of complaints.",86
46487,ELAINE, Yeah? Like what?,86
46488,TINA," Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief.",86
46489,ELAINE," Ah, I didn't know who he was!",86
46490,TINA, That's why there's a buzzer.,86
46491,ELAINE, What else?,86
46492,TINA," Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building.",86
46493,ELAINE, What else have you got?,86
46494,TINA," Well, let's see. ",86
46495,JERRY," I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.",86
46496,RACHEL, I suppose...,86
46497,JERRY," Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.",86
46498,RACHEL,  Jerry ...,86
46499,JERRY, Yes?,86
46500,RACHEL, I've been doing a lot of thinking.,86
46501,JERRY, Uh huh?,86
46502,RACHEL," Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.",86
46503,JERRY," Oh, that's okay.",86
46504,RACHEL,  What?,86
46505,JERRY," Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.",86
46506,RACHEL, You will?,86
46507,JERRY," Sure. See, things always even out for me.",86
46508,RACHEL, Huh?,86
46509,JERRY," It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!",86
46510,RACHEL," Yeah, you too.",86
46511,JERRY,  She'll be coming around the mountain...,86
46512,JERRY, The New York Yankees?!,86
46513,GEORGE, The New York Yankees!,86
46514,JERRY," Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?",86
46515,GEORGE," I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!",86
46516,JERRY, I can't believe it.,86
46517,GEORGE, Ya!,86
46518,JERRY, Ya?,86
46519,ELAINE,  It's me.,86
46520,JERRY,  Come on up.,86
46521,GEORGE," And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?",86
46522,JERRY, That's a great place!,86
46523,GEORGE," I'm back in business, baby!",86
46524,JERRY," George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.",86
46525,GEORGE, Hey! ,86
46526,JERRY, Hi Elaine.,86
46527,ELAINE, Hi.,86
46528,JERRY, How're things going?,86
46529,ELAINE, How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!,86
46530,JERRY, Why? Why are they doing that?,86
46531,ELAINE, I don't know! They have a list of grievances.,86
46532,JERRY, The jewel thief?,86
46533,ELAINE," Yeah, the jewel thief.",86
46534,JERRY, What else?,86
46535,ELAINE, I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine.  I gotta be out by the end of the month.,86
46536,GEORGE," Well, you could move in with my parents. ",86
46537,ELAINE," Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? ",86
46538,GEORGE, Instinct.,86
46539,ELAINE, Stick ... with the opposite. ,86
46540,JERRY," Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up,  he was down. Now he's up,  you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?",86
46541,SECRETARY," Mr. Lippman, the people from Matsushimi are here.",86
46542,MR. LIPPMAN," Oh ya alright... tell them I'll be right there.  Oh man well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us.",86
46543,ELAINE,"  Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.",86
46544,CHAIRMAN,  Ah Lippman son.  Lippman son. ,86
46545,INTERPRETER," Mr Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake this partnership with your company.",86
46546,MR. LIPPMAN," I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs.",86
46547,JERRY, Is that the end of it?,86
46548,GEORGE," Yeah, it's the last one.",86
46549,JERRY, Alright.,86
46550,ESTELLE," I can't believe you're moving out.  Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.",86
46551,KRAMER," Oh, it's true.",86
46552,GEORGE," Alright, let's go.",86
46553,FRANK, Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. ,86
46554,GEORGE, I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.,86
46555,ESTELLE," Jerry, did you hear this?",86
46556,JERRY, He knows what he's doing.,86
46557,GEORGE," I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.",86
46558,JERRY, Opposite.,86
46559,ELAINE, I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!,86
46560,JERRY, Why'd you have to eat so many?,86
46561,ELAINE, Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.,86
46562,JERRY, Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.,86
46563,KRAMER," Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!",86
46564,ELAINE, Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.,86
46565,JERRY, Don't say that.,86
46566,ELAINE, It's true. I'm George! I'm George!,86
46567,GEORGE," Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two!  Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'.  So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly -  he's the first base man.",86
46568,ELAINE, Uh huh.,86
46569,GEORGE," We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.",86
46570,KRAMER," Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.",86
46571,JERRY, Ah ... let's call it even.,86
46572,JERRY,"Baseball is so associated with sex. ""He's playing the field,"" ""Hoo, he scored,"" ""oh, he didn't get to first base."" ""I struck out."" ""Why?"" ""She wanted a diamond."" It's always about baseball. Always baseball. As far as baseball goes, I prefer the fat umpires...I feel if you're on the field and you're not in the game, you should be in the worst physical condition a human being could possibly be in. They should be allowed to eat during the game. We're a little too into sports in this country, I think we gotta throttle back. Know what I mean? People come home from these games, ""We won! We won!"" No, they won - you watched.",87
46573,GEORGE," O.K., Danny, take a swing.  N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.",87
46574,TARTABULL, Really?,87
46575,GEORGE," No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!",87
46576,TARTABULL ," Alright, alright.",87
46577,GEORGE, What are all sweatin' for?,87
46578,TARTABULL, It's hot in this uniform.,87
46579,GEORGE, Hot?  What is this?,87
46580,TARTBULL, What is what?,87
46581,GEORGE," This uniform, what's it made from?",87
46582,TARTBULL," I don't know, cotton?",87
46583,GEORGE," No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see.  Will you stop it?  Oh. Of course. Polyester!",87
46584,TARTABULL, So?,87
46585,GEORGE, I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.,87
46586,TARTABULL," Well, this is what they give us.",87
46587,GEORGE, You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?,87
46588,TARTABULL, You really think cotton's better?,87
46589,GEORGE," Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.",87
46590,TARTABULL," Yeah, good idea. Catch ya later. ",87
46591,GEORGE," Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. ",87
46592,HOT DOG VENDOR, Hot dogs here! Yankee franks!,87
46593,ELAINE," Oh, you want one?",87
46594,JERRY, Yeah.,87
46595,ELAINE, I'll get it. ,87
46596,JERRY," That's alright, I got it.",87
46597,ELAINE, Jerry!,87
46598,JERRY," Elaine, stop it.",87
46599,ELAINE," Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money.  Yo! Dogs! Two!",87
46600,JERRY, I'm sorry.,87
46601,ANNOUNCER ON P.A. SYSTEM," Your attention please...the New York Yankees would like to welcome Miss Connecticut, Miss Rhode Island and Miss North Dakota, all of whom will be competing in the Miss America pageant this weekend in Atlantic City. ",87
46602,JERRY ," Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.",87
46603,ELAINE," Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.",87
46604,JERRY," Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?",87
46605,ELAINE," Yeah, she was an editor.",87
46606,JERRY," Right, just like you.",87
46607,ELAINE, Yeah. Can you hold my seat? ,87
46608,CROWD, Hey! Down in front! ,87
46609,JERRY , Hot dog?,87
46610,MISS RHODE ISLAND," No, thanks. I'm watching my weight.",87
46611,JERRY," Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...",87
46612,MISS RHODE ISLAND, Rhode Island.,87
46613,JERRY, I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. ,87
46614,GEORGE, Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?,87
46615,JERRY," Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.",87
46616,GEORGE, You're incredible.,87
46617,JERRY," And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.",87
46618,GEORGE," What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!",87
46619,JERRY," The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.",87
46620,GEORGE," Chaperone? What, are you kidding?",87
46621,JERRY," No, it's part of the contest rules.",87
46622,GEORGE, What does the chaperone do?,87
46623,JERRY," I don't know, she just sits there.",87
46624,GEORGE, Can she talk?,87
46625,JERRY, I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. ,87
46626,GEORGE, You're calling her?,87
46627,JERRY," Yeah.  There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?",87
46628,GEORGE," Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?",87
46629,JERRY," Of course, they're polyester.",87
46630,GEORGE," Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.",87
46631,JERRY, Why do they wear polyester?,87
46632,GEORGE, I don't know. That's all gonna change.,87
46633,JERRY, You're going to do something about it?,87
46634,GEORGE, Why shouldn't I?,87
46635,JERRY , No reason...,87
46636,LANDIS," Of course, Jackie O. was a great lady. Those are going to be some tough shoes to fill. Everyone loved her. She had such...grace.",87
46637,ELAINE , Yes! Grace!,87
46638,LANDIS, Not many people have grace.,87
46639,ELAINE," Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -",87
46640,LANDIS," You can't have ""a little grace."" You either have grace, or you...don't.",87
46641,ELAINE," O.K., fine, I have...no grace.",87
46642,LANDIS, And you can't acquire grace.,87
46643,ELAINE," Well, I have no intention of ""getting"" grace.",87
46644,LANDIS, Grace isn't something you can pick up at the market.,87
46645,ELAINE ," Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?",87
46646,LANDIS, Thank you for coming in.,87
46647,ELAINE," Yeah, yeah, right.",87
46648,LANDIS," We'll make our choice in a few days, and we'll let you know.",87
46649,ELAINE ," I have no chance, do I?",87
46650,LANDIS, No. ,87
46651,ELAINE, Justin Pitt?,87
46652,LANDIS, He was a very close friend of Mrs. Onassis's.,87
46653,ELAINE," ""Mrs. Onassis's""? That's hard to pronounce.",87
46654,LANDIS, Excuse me?,87
46655,ELAINE, Nothing. ,87
46656,PITT," Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department or not.",87
46657,LANDIS," Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes. ",87
46658,PITT , Charmed.,87
46659,ELAINE, I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...,87
46660,JERRY," Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that ""Miss Congeniality"" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone.  The chaperone can't make it.  Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going?  Hold on one second.  Hey, what are you doing tonight?",87
46661,KRAMER, Nothin.',87
46662,JERRY," I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?",87
46663,KRAMER, What state?,87
46664,JERRY, Rhode Island.,87
46665,KRAMER, They're never in contention.,87
46666,GEORGE, How do you know?,87
46667,KRAMER, Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.,87
46668,JERRY," Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.",87
46669,KRAMER, Giddy-up!,87
46670,JERRY , I think I got someone!,87
46671,PITT , The resemblance is uncanny.  Even the brown eyes.,87
46672,ELAINE," Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.",87
46673,PITT," No, there's something else. An indefinable quality.",87
46674,ELAINE, Grace?,87
46675,PITT," Grace, yes.",87
46676,ELAINE, You think Ihave grace?,87
46677,PITT," Some grace, yes.",87
46678,ELAINE, Just some?,87
46679,PITT," Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand.",87
46680,ELAINE ," Oh, Mr. Pitt.",87
46681,PITT," Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away.",87
46682,GEORGE," Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?",87
46683,SHOWALTER," Sure, George.",87
46684,GEORGE, How's everything going? Everything O.K.?,87
46685,SHOWALTER," Well, all of a sudden there's a problem with Tartabull's swing...",87
46686,GEORGE," Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.",87
46687,SHOWALTER, How so?,87
46688,GEORGE," Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.",87
46689,SHOWALTER," Cotton, huh?",87
46690,GEORGE," Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.",87
46691,SHOWALTER," You may have something there, George.",87
46692,GEORGE, Oh - I've got something.,87
46693,SHOWALTER , Hmm. Cotton uniforms.,87
46694,JERRY, Congratulations!,87
46695,ELAINE," Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.",87
46696,JERRY," Now, what is it that you do, exactly?",87
46697,ELAINE, I attend to his personal affairs.,87
46698,JERRY, Like what?,87
46699,ELAINE," Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.",87
46700,JERRY, Really! Socks!,87
46701,ELAINE, Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.,87
46702,JERRY," Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! ",87
46703,KRAMER ," So, what do you think? Does this work?",87
46704,JERRY," Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just ""recede into the night,"" if you know what I mean.",87
46705,KRAMER, No way!,87
46706,JERRY, What?,87
46707,KRAMER," Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.",87
46708,JERRY," I'm not going to ""defile"" her!",87
46709,KRAMER," That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.",87
46710,JERRY, But -,87
46711,KRAMER , AAAH! No buts! Those are my rules.,87
46712,JERRY, But wait a minute...,87
46713,KRAMER," Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! ",87
46714,KRAMER," If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?",87
46715,KAREN," As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!",87
46716,JERRY, That's a hell of a plan.  Listen -,87
46717,KRAMER , What advice would you give young people?,87
46718,JERRY," Alright, Kramer!",87
46719,KRAMER," This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.",87
46720,KAREN," You really know a lot about this, don't you?",87
46721,KRAMER," Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.",87
46722,KAREN," Well, what could she have done?",87
46723,KRAMER, Tape her breasts together. ,87
46724,KAREN, What else?,87
46725,KRAMER," Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.",87
46726,JERRY," Hey, come on!",87
46727,KAREN," No, no...it's O.K.  Go on.",87
46728,KRAMER," Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.",87
46729,KAREN, Really.,87
46730,KRAMER," Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.",87
46731,JERRY, I'll be right back. ,87
46732,KRAMER," So, what's your talent?",87
46733,KAREN, Magic.,87
46734,KRAMER, Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.,87
46735,KAREN, Six.,87
46736,KRAMER," No, five. But you were close.",87
46737,KRAMER, How's your evening?,87
46738,KAREN," Well, I'm wearing this red dress -",87
46739,KRAMER, Stop right there.,87
46740,KAREN, No good?,87
46741,KRAMER, Disaster.,87
46742,KAREN, Why?,87
46743,KRAMER," Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.",87
46744,KAREN, That makes sense. ,87
46745,JERRY," Well, here we are...",87
46746,KAREN," Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?",87
46747,KRAMER," Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.",87
46748,KAREN," I am in your hands.  Well! Oh, good night, Jerry.  Kenneth will take you home. ",87
46749,KRAMER, Hey.,87
46750,JERRY," Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.",87
46751,KRAMER," Oh, come on.",87
46752,JERRY," And that waist cincher, that was the topper!",87
46753,KRAMER," Oh, you're poo-pooing!",87
46754,JERRY," Yes, I poo-poo.",87
46755,KRAMER," Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!",87
46756,JERRY, I don't want to stop her!,87
46757,KRAMER," You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! ",87
46758,JERRY," Yeah, so do you. ",87
46759,GEORGE," Well, did you see it?",87
46760,JERRY, See what?,87
46761,GEORGE," The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments!  ""Wade Boggs",87
46762,JERRY," Boy, they really do sound comfortable.",87
46763,GEORGE ," Hey, where ya goin'?",87
46764,JERRY, I'm working in Atlantic City.,87
46765,GEORGE, Really!,87
46766,JERRY," Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?",87
46767,GEORGE, Atlantic City?  Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.,87
46768,JERRY," You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her.  She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...",87
46769,ELAINE," So, what do you think?",87
46770,PITT , No.,87
46771,ELAINE, You don't like them?,87
46772,PITT," No, I don't like them.",87
46773,ELAINE, What's wrong?,87
46774,PITT, They're too tight.,87
46775,ELAINE, Too tight?,87
46776,PITT," There's no elastic, you need to pull too much .",87
46777,ELAINE , I think they look good!,87
46778,PITT, They're cutting off the circulation.,87
46779,ELAINE," Alright, well, I'll just take them back. ",87
46780,PITT, Hello?,87
46781,JERRY," Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?",87
46782,PITT , It's for you.,87
46783,ELAINE, Sorry. Hello?,87
46784,JERRY," Hey Elaine, it's me.",87
46785,ELAINE, Jerry?,87
46786,JERRY, We're going to Atlantic City.,87
46787,ELAINE, Really? When?,87
46788,JERRY," Today, right now! Are you in?",87
46789,ELAINE," One second, hang on.  Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?",87
46790,PITT, Tomorrow?,87
46791,ELAINE, Yes.,87
46792,PITT, But I was hoping for my new socks today!,87
46793,ELAINE," Well, it's just one more day.",87
46794,PITT, I'm sorry. I must have them today.,87
46795,ELAINE , I can't go.,87
46796,JERRY, Why not?,87
46797,ELAINE, Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.,87
46798,PITT, Elaine!,87
46799,ELAINE, I gotta go. ,87
46800,KRAMER," No. Alright, watch me now.  Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.",87
46801,KAREN," Yes, I see. O.K.",87
46802,KRAMER," Let's try a few more questions, alright?  If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?",87
46803,KAREN," Kramer, are these questions really that important...?",87
46804,KRAMER," Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!",87
46805,GEORGE, Hey.,87
46806,JERRY, Hey.,87
46807,GEORGE, How was the show?,87
46808,JERRY, Good. How was the roulette?,87
46809,GEORGE," I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.",87
46810,JERRY," Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!",87
46811,PITT," It's good, but...",87
46812,ELAINE, But what??,87
46813,PITT, Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up.,87
46814,ELAINE ," No, no! They'll stay up!",87
46815,PITT," For a while, yes, but not in the long run.",87
46816,ELAINE, But that's why I got you the tighter ones! ,87
46817,PITT," Oh, forget about those!  Why do you keep mentioning those?",87
46818,ELAINE, What do you want!?,87
46819,PITT," I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!",87
46820,JERRY, What the hell is that?,87
46821,GEORGE," I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!",87
46822,JERRY ," Well, I can't sleep with that noise.",87
46823,GEORGE, Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?,87
46824,JERRY," Wait a second.  This'll scare 'em off.  Well, good night, Ollie.",87
46825,GEORGE," Good night, Stan.",87
46826,KRAMER, What is it?,87
46827,KAREN, My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now?,87
46828,KRAMER, How did this happen?,87
46829,KAREN," They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water!",87
46830,KRAMER ," Well, how did this happen?",87
46831,KAREN, It must have been an accident.,87
46832,KRAMER, Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.,87
46833,KRAMER," Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!",87
46834,JERRY, What? Why? What happened?,87
46835,KRAMER, Her birds are dead.,87
46836,JERRY, Birds?,87
46837,KRAMER," Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! ",87
46838,JERRY," What are you looking at?  Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.",87
46839,KRAMER ," You killed them, didn't you?",87
46840,JERRY," No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!",87
46841,KRAMER," Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!",87
46842,JERRY," Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! ",87
46843,GEORGE , What was that all about?,87
46844,JERRY," Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.",87
46845,GEORGE, Oh. ,87
46846,KAREN," O.K., this is it!",87
46847,KRAMER, How ya feelin'?,87
46848,KAREN, I'm a little nervous!,87
46849,KRAMER, There's nothing to be nervous about.,87
46850,KAREN, But I've never sung before in my life!,87
46851,PHILBIN," And now, let's welcome Karen Ann Hanson, Miss Rhode Island!",87
46852,JERRY, I heard those doves were really incredible.,87
46853,GEORGE, That's a shame. ,87
46854,JERRY, It's like watching an animal get tortured.,87
46855,GEORGE," Hey, hey! Yankee game! ",87
46856,JERRY," Oh, great! Alright. ",87
46857,JERRY, That's a shame.,87
46858,KRAMER, Poise. Poise!,87
46859,JERRY,Its fascinating. When you go into a stationery store that they’re manufacturing millions of pens; constantly we’re all buying them. I must have bought six thousand Bics in my life. I’ve used up maybe two of them. Where are the rest of them? When you move the refrigerator there’s a couple back there but it doesn’t account for it. Where are all the pens? That’s why it’s so embarrassing if you don’t have one. You got a pen? Can I borrow a pen? We always have to whisper because it’s so humiliating. I don’t have a pen. They’re making millions of them every week!   I know; where are they?,88
46860,STATIONER, May I help you?,88
46861,ELAINE," Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.",88
46862,STATIONER," Oh, I know the Rollamech 1000.",88
46863,ELAINE," No, I'm sure you do.",88
46864,STATIONER, They're pretty expensive.,88
46865,ELAINE," Well, it's for my boss.",88
46866,STATIONER, What do you do?,88
46867,STATIONER," Well, we don't have any in stock right now but I would be happy to order it for you. Just give me your phone number and when it comes in I'll give you a call. You're name is?",88
46868,ELAINE, Elaine.,88
46869,STATIONER," Elaine, . . . and your last name?",88
46870,ELAINE," It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha",88
46871,STATIONER, And your number?,88
46872,ELAINE," Uh, aw, KL5-239O.",88
46873,STATIONER, Okay. Thanks a lot. You'll be hearing from me.,88
46874,ELAINE," Okay,   Move  along. . .",88
46875,JERRY, Why did you give him MY number?,88
46876,ELAINE, I think he's got ideas.,88
46877,JERRY, I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?,88
46878,JERRY, Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?,88
46879,ELAINE," Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?",88
46880,JERRY, Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.,88
46881,GEORGE," Hey, hey.",88
46882,ELAINE, Hey hey,88
46883,JULIE, Hi Jerry.,88
46884,JERRY, Hi Julie.,88
46885,GEORGE," Elaine, Julie.",88
46886,ELAINE, Hi.,88
46887,JULIE, Hi.,88
46888,JULIE," Oh, hi.  Elaine's my middle name.",88
46889,ELAINE," Oh, mine's ""Ike"".",88
46890,GEORGE," Hey, wanna get some lunch?",88
46891,JERRY, Just had a big bowl of Kix.,88
46892,GEORGE," Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?",88
46893,ELAINE," Ah, no.",88
46894,JULIE," Please come, Elaine.",88
46895,ELAINE," No, no. How about if you bring me back something?",88
46896,GEORGE," Sure, all right, what do you want?",88
46897,ELAINE," Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?",88
46898,GEORGE, What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.,88
46899,ELAINE, They have big salads.,88
46900,GEORGE, I've never seen a big salad.,88
46901,ELAINE, They have a big salad.,88
46902,GEORGE, Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?,88
46903,ELAINE," It's okay, you don't…",88
46904,GEORGE," No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?",88
46905,JERRY," Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.",88
46906,GEORGE," , we'll see you in a little while.",88
46907,ELAINE, Maybe I should just get married.,88
46908,JERRY, Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?,88
46909,ELAINE," I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.",88
46910,JERRY, People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.,88
46911,ELAINE, You can say that again.,88
46912,JERRY," It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.",88
46913,ELAINE, Good for you.,88
46914,JERRY, I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.,88
46915,ELAINE, Right on baby. ,88
46916,JERRY, What was that?,88
46917,KRAMER," That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.",88
46918,ELAINE, Who Gendason?,88
46919,KRAMER, Steve Gendason.,88
46920,ELAINE, Why is that name familiar?,88
46921,ELAINE," Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?",88
46922,KRAMER," Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.",88
46923,ELAINE, So what?,88
46924,KRAMER," Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.",88
46925,JERRY, Certainly are.,88
46926,KRAMER," Ya, so I penalized him a stroke.",88
46927,KRAMER, He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .,88
46928,JERRY, All right. You're in MY face.,88
46929,ELAINE, I still don't see what the big deal is.,88
46930,KRAMER, A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.,88
46931,JULIE, I like Anna Quindlen's column and Safire. Don't you like Safire?,88
46932,GEORGE," Oh, Safire. Uh ha",88
46933,JULIE, Although at times can be rather pedantic.,88
46934,GEORGE, He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.,88
46935,JULIE, And Bob Herbert's great. He's the Daily News.,88
46936,GEORGE," Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No ""r"" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. ""Hebert"" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right.  All right. I",88
46937,JULIE," No, no. I'd like to take you out.",88
46938,GEORGE," No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.",88
46939,JULIE," Okay, thanks, George.",88
46940,JULIE," Oh, thank you.",88
46941,JERRY,"  Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.",88
46942,ELAINE, I told ya'. He has ideas.,88
46943,JERRY, He doesn't even care if a man answers.,88
46944,ELAINE, Or you.,88
46945,GEORGE," Hey, hey.",88
46946,ELAINE, Hey.,88
46947,JULIE, Sorry e're late.,88
46948,ELAINE, No problem.,88
46949,JULIE, Here's your big salad.,88
46950,ELAINE," Thank you, Julie.",88
46951,JULIE," Oh, you're very welcome. So, I guess I better get going. Gotta meet mother a t the Guggenheim. Sure you don't want to go?",88
46952,GEORGE," No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.",88
46953,JULIE," Sure, George.",88
46954,GEORGE," Ya, you go.",88
46955,JULIE," Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye.",88
46956,JERRY, Bye bye,88
46957,GEORGE, Did you see what just happened?,88
46958,JERRY," Well, that all depends. . .",88
46959,GEORGE, Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?,88
46960,JERRY," Yeah, so?",88
46961,GEORGE," Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.",88
46962,JERRY, Is that a fact?,88
46963,GEORGE, Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.,88
46964,JERRY, No it isn't.,88
46965,GEORGE, I mean I'm the one who bought it.,88
46966,JERRY, Yes you did.,88
46967,GEORGE, You think she should have said something?,88
46968,JERRY, She could have.,88
46969,GEORGE," Oh, I know.",88
46970,JERRY," Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.",88
46971,GEORGE, You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.,88
46972,JERRY, Obviously.,88
46973,KRAMER, Turn on the TV.,88
46974,JERRY, What?,88
46975,KRAMER, I'm puttin it on…,88
46976,TV," . . . the district attorney's office and the police department have not answered any questions as yet. To repeat in case you're just joining us. Former baseball start Steve Genderson, has been taken to Police headquarters for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something we'll just have to wait.",88
46977,KRAMER, Jerry . . .,88
46978,JERRY," Well, it has nothing to do with you.",88
46979,KRAMER," Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.",88
46980,JERRY," Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.",88
46981,ELAINE, I like Julie. She's very personable.,88
46982,GEORGE," Yeah, she's very lovely.",88
46983,ELAINE, That's great George.,88
46984,GEORGE, So did you enjoy your lunch?,88
46985,ELAINE," Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?",88
46986,GEORGE," oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .",88
46987,ELAINE, Even though what?,88
46988,GEORGE," . . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?",88
46989,ELAINE," What? What are you trying to say, George?",88
46990,GEORGE, It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.,88
46991,ELAINE," You want the money for the big salad, George?",88
46992,GEORGE," No, no,",88
46993,ELAINE, What is the problem?,88
46994,GEORGE, There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.,88
46995,JERRY, And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.,88
46996,MARGARET," Well, they haven't even arrested him yet. Come on, let's go out.",88
46997,JERRY," Ah, no , I don't think so.",88
46998,MARGARET, Why not?,88
46999,JERRY, We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.,88
47000,MARGARET, Who is staring?													JERRY,88
47001,JERRY," Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.",88
47002,JERRY, Hello Newman.,88
47003,MARGARET," Hello Jerry, I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was.",88
47004,JERRY," No, no I don't. Why?",88
47005,MARGARET," You know, Genderson. This is something big.",88
47006,JERRY, I suppose.,88
47007,MARGARET, What did Kramer say?,88
47008,JERRY, I don't know. Nothing.?,88
47009,MARGARET," Come on Jerry. You know something TELL ME! TELL ME!, Oh, chocolates . . . Margaret?",88
47010,MARGARET, Hello.,88
47011,JERRY, You two know each other?,88
47012,NEWMAN, You might say that.,88
47013,MARGARET, We used to go out.,88
47014,NEWMAN," Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe",88
47015,JERRY, . . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?,88
47016,MARGARET, Just a few times.,88
47017,JERRY, Why?,88
47018,MARGARET, I liked him.,88
47019,JERRY," You liked, Newman?",88
47020,MARGARET, Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay?,88
47021,JERRY," No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.",88
47022,MARGARET, He ended it.,88
47023,JERRY, . . . HE ended it?,88
47024,MARGARET, YES!! Yes! It was a couple of years ago. Why does it matter?,88
47025,JERRY," No, no of course not.",88
47026,KRAMER," Jerry, Jerry they found a tee.",88
47027,JERRY, What tee?,88
47028,KRAMER, A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.,88
47029,JERRY, Newman! She went out with Newman!,88
47030,ELAINE, It must be a mistake.,88
47031,JERRY," No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?",88
47032,ELAINE, Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.,88
47033,JERRY," No, there's less.",88
47034,ELAINE, It's possible.,88
47035,JERRY, No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.,88
47036,ELAINE," He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.",88
47037,JERRY," Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.",88
47038,JERRY," No,, but thank you.",88
47039,JERRY," Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.",88
47040,ELAINE, Ugh! You are kidding me.,88
47041,JERRY," No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.",88
47042,ELAINE, I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.,88
47043,JERRY," Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.",88
47044,ELAINE, To please Mr. Pitt.,88
47045,JERRY," Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.",88
47046,ELAINE," Uh, great!",88
47047,JERRY, Hi Julie.,88
47048,JERRY, Hi.,88
47049,ELAINE, Hi Julie.,88
47050,JERRY," Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.",88
47051,ELAINE," Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.",88
47052,JERRY, How do you know THAT?,88
47053,NEWMAN, Who is it.,88
47054,JERRY, It's Jerry.,88
47055,NEWMAN, You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?,88
47056,JERRY, Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!,88
47057,NEWMAN, Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?,88
47058,JERRY," Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?",88
47059,NEWMAN, There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?,88
47060,JERRY," No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?",88
47061,NEWMAN, Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.,88
47062,JERRY, Noit your type?,88
47063,NEWMAN, Not really.,88
47064,JERRY," Well, how come?",88
47065,NEWMAN," Ah, she just didn't do it for me.",88
47066,JERRY," What, what is wrong with her?",88
47067,NEWMAN," Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.",88
47068,JERRY, You don't think she's attractive?,88
47069,NEWMAN," No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.",88
47070,JERRY," Okay, Newman, thanks a lot.",88
47071,NEWMAN, Care for some lemonade?,88
47072,JERRY," No, thank you.",88
47073,NEWMAN," Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha",88
47074,KRAMER," Listen to this, ""If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. "" That's a rule, Jerry.",88
47075,JERRY, But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?,88
47076,KRAMER," Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.",88
47077,JERRY, What are you so worried about this for?,88
47078,KRAMER, You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?,88
47079,JERRY, He did?,88
47080,KRAMER," Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.",88
47081,JERRY, So it had nothing to do with you.,88
47082,KRAMER," Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.",88
47083,JERRY," No, I don't think so.",88
47084,KRAMER," Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus.",88
47085,JERRY," Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.",88
47086,JERRY," Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?",88
47087,KRAMER," Oh, I love curls.",88
47088,JERRY," Yeah,, me too.",88
47089,KRAMER," All right, I'll see you later.",88
47090,JERRY, Where you going?,88
47091,KRAMER, Genderson's.,88
47092,JERRY, You're going to see Genderson?,88
47093,KRAMER, It's weighing on my conscience.,88
47094,GEORGE," You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?",88
47095,JULIE," Ha. So, George, I was talking to Elaine before.",88
47096,GEORGE, A ha! We're just friends.,88
47097,JULIE," Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing.",88
47098,GEORGE," Oh, share.",88
47099,JULIE," Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought yesterday.",88
47100,GEORGE," Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.",88
47101,JULIE," Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to her?",88
47102,GEORGE," Well, she probably just assumed.",88
47103,JULIE," Um, did she?",88
47104,GEORGE," . . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?",88
47105,JULIE, That's what I'm suggesting.,88
47106,GEORGE," . . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?",88
47107,JULIE," George, all I did was hand someone a bag.",88
47108,ELAINE, It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.,88
47109,STATIONER," Well,, why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were going to get one someplace else?",88
47110,ELAINE," No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.",88
47111,STATIONER, I went all the way down to the warehouse. It took me three hours. I had a big fight with the foreman.,88
47112,ELAINE, Really? A fight with the foreman?,88
47113,STATIONER, Yes.,88
47114,ELAINE," Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.",88
47115,STATIONER," Yeah? Well, then how about going out with me tonight?",88
47116,ELAINE, Okay.,88
47117,MARGARET, I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. Nobody walks into a dry cleaner's with a tee. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.,88
47118,JERRY, You had how many dates with him? Three?,88
47119,MARGARET, Around three. I don't know.,88
47120,JERRY, And . .,88
47121,MARGARET, I told you. He stopped calling me. I moved on. I'm not hung up on him. What are you looking at?,88
47122,JERRY, What? I'm not looking. Nothing.,88
47123,JERRY, Why are you looking at my face?,88
47124,JERRY, Where am I going to look?,88
47125,MARGARET, Kiss me.,88
47126,JERRY, . . . I can't.,88
47127,JERRY, Newman!,88
47128,JERRY, All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.,88
47129,ELAINE," Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.",88
47130,JERRY, You're going out with the stationery store guy?,88
47131,ELAINE, I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.,88
47132,ELAINE," Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.",88
47133,ELAINE," Uh, uh.",88
47134,GEORGE," You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.",88
47135,JERRY," Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here.  Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.",88
47136,TV," As you can see white Bronco. The police have cleared the highway traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don't want the situation to escalate. And we have gotten an identification on the driver of the vehicle. His name is; Kramer, one of Genderson's golfing buddies.",88
47137,POLICE, 9-1-1 What are you reporting,88
47138,KRAMER," Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.",88
47139,POLICE," Okay, sir, and what's your name?",88
47140,KRAMER, My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!,88
47141,KRAMER, I thought we would blend in.,88
47142,KRAMER, we would have had all that bridge traffic.,88
47143,ELAINE, She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?,89
47144,JERRY," Your friend, Noreen.",89
47145,ELAINE, Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?,89
47146,JERRY," If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.",89
47147,ELAINE, I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.,89
47148,JERRY," If you don't believe me, ask her.",89
47149,ELAINE," I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?",89
47150,JERRY," Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.",89
47151,ELAINE, Yeah.,89
47152,KRAMER," Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?",89
47153,JERRY, Check the pile.,89
47154,KRAMER,"  Oh, who sent you a card?",89
47155,JERRY, I don't know.,89
47156,KRAMER," Open it, it's from Hallmark.",89
47157,JERRY, Oh.,89
47158,ELAINE," Hello, darling.",89
47159,JERRY," Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.",89
47160,KRAMER, Let me see.,89
47161,ELAINE, Who's Kristin?,89
47162,JERRY," She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.",89
47163,KRAMER, Did you ask her about me?,89
47164,JERRY," Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.",89
47165,KRAMER," Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?",89
47166,JERRY," No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.",89
47167,KRAMER," Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?",89
47168,JERRY," Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.",89
47169,ELAINE,  You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.,89
47170,JERRY," Oh, go ahead.",89
47171,ELAINE, You sure you don't mind?,89
47172,JERRY, Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.,89
47173,HIGH PITCHED VOICE, Hello?,89
47174,ELAINE," Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.",89
47175,HIGH PITCHED VOICE, Jerry?,89
47176,ELAINE, Jerry Seinfeld.,89
47177,HIGH PITCHED VOICE," Oh, I like Jerry a lot.",89
47178,ELAINE, You mean like like?,89
47179,HIGH PITCHED VOICE, What are you talking about?,89
47180,ELAINE," Noreen, were you hitting on him?",89
47181,HIGH PITCHED VOICE," Noreen's not here, this is Dan.",89
47182,ELAINE, Ooh.,89
47183,DAN, You say that Noreen was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?,89
47184,ELAINE, Uh oh.,89
47185,JERRY," So was I right? She likes me, right?",89
47186,ELAINE," Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello?",89
47187,HIGH PITCHED VOICE, Elaine? What is going on? Why did you tell Dan I was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?,89
47188,ELAINE, Is this Noreen?,89
47189,HIGH PITCHED VOICE,  What would ever possess you to make up a story like that.,89
47190,ELAINE," Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--",89
47191,ELAINE," Noreen, are you crying?",89
47192,DAN," No, this is Dan!",89
47193,ELAINE," Oh, hi Dan.",89
47194,MR. PITT, Elaine? Work?,89
47195,ELAINE, Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.,89
47196,MR. PITT, Who was crying?,89
47197,ELAINE," No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.",89
47198,MR. PITT,"  I'm sure it won't, but someone was crying and I want to know who it was.",89
47199,ELAINE," Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was--  You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--",89
47200,JERRY," I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.",89
47201,KRISTIN," Jerry, I am so grateful that you're doing this.",89
47202,JERRY," Oh, I know you are.",89
47203,KRISTIN, You got the card I sent?,89
47204,JERRY, I did.,89
47205,KRISTIN, So where is it?,89
47206,JERRY, What?,89
47207,KRISTIN, The card. Is this it in the trash?,89
47208,JERRY, No?,89
47209,KRISTIN," This is my card, you threw it away.",89
47210,JERRY, Well--,89
47211,KRISTIN, I put a lot of thought into this card.,89
47212,JERRY," You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.",89
47213,KRISTIN, Fine. I gotta get back to the office.,89
47214,JERRY," Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?",89
47215,KRISTIN, You have no sentimentality.,89
47216,JERRY," I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.",89
47217,KRISTIN," Oh, so you save her cards but not mine! Oh great!",89
47218,JERRY,"  Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?",89
47219,KRAMER," New cards, huh?",89
47220,JERRY," No, they're old cards from my grandmother.",89
47221,KRAMER," Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.",89
47222,JERRY, Yeah.,89
47223,KRAMER,"  Oh, a check.",89
47224,JERRY," Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.",89
47225,KRAMER, There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?,89
47226,JERRY," I don't know, it's ten dollars.",89
47227,KRAMER, But you got a whole pile here. 1987?,89
47228,JERRY, Oh so what.,89
47229,KRAMER," Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.",89
47230,JERRY," Oh, get out of here.",89
47231,KRAMER," Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.",89
47232,JERRY," Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks.",89
47233,KRAMER, Yeah.,89
47234,JERRY," It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?",89
47235,GEORGE, The rule is a minimum of two days.,89
47236,JERRY, You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?,89
47237,GEORGE, I'm making it up.,89
47238,JERRY," I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.",89
47239,GEORGE," Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.",89
47240,JERRY, Absolutely.,89
47241,GEORGE," If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.",89
47242,JERRY," So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.",89
47243,GEORGE, Let's have it.,89
47244,JERRY," Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...",89
47245,GEORGE, You want me to ask one of the Yankees.,89
47246,JERRY, Could you?,89
47247,GEORGE, Alright. I'll run it by a few people.,89
47248,JERRY," Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.",89
47249,ELAINE,  I should never have made that phone call.,89
47250,JERRY," Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?",89
47251,ELAINE," Yes, she's very upset.",89
47252,JERRY, So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?,89
47253,ELAINE," I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--",89
47254,GEORGE, Who was flirting with you?,89
47255,JERRY," Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?",89
47256,GEORGE, She wasn't flirting with you.,89
47257,JERRY," Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.",89
47258,ELAINE," Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.",89
47259,JERRY," Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?",89
47260,ELAINE," So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.",89
47261,GEORGE, Really?,89
47262,ELAINE, Yeah.,89
47263,JERRY, Why does he do that?,89
47264,GEORGE, He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.,89
47265,JERRY," Oh, you know.",89
47266,GEORGE," What, you think I eat all my meals with you?  Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?",89
47267,WAITRESS, That's the extra toast. Get it?,89
47268,GEORGE, Got it.  Did you just see what happened here?,89
47269,ELAINE, What?,89
47270,GEORGE, Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.,89
47271,JERRY, That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.,89
47272,GEORGE," So, what do you think?",89
47273,MR. MORGAN," A PBS fundraiser? I'm not gonna waste any of the players' time with that, besides the team already does so much promotion for channel eleven.",89
47274,GEORGE," Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.",89
47275,MR. MORGAN," Uh, what the hell are you doing?",89
47276,GEORGE," I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?",89
47277,MR. MORGAN," You know, maybe George has something here about PBS.",89
47278,JERRY," Okay, sixty bucks from Nana.",89
47279,KRAMER, Huh? Yeah.,89
47280,NANA, Hello?,89
47281,VOICE," Hello, this is Chemical Bank. Just wanted you to know that your checking account is overdrawn.",89
47282,NANA, Chemical Bank? I haven't used that account in months.,89
47283,VOICE," Well, someone's been cashing the checks and you're overdrawn.",89
47284,NANA, Oh dear. I'll be down there first thing in the morning.,89
47285,VOICE,"  Wait, we can do this over the phone.",89
47286,JERRY, You got Danny Tartabull?!,89
47287,GEORGE," You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.",89
47288,JERRY," Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.",89
47289,GEORGE," Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.",89
47290,KRAMER, So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.,89
47291,GEORGE, Absolutely. Pending approval of the script.,89
47292,JERRY, Excuse me?,89
47293,GEORGE," Jerry, I'm Yankee management.",89
47294,KRAMER," Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.",89
47295,JERRY, You're just answering phones!,89
47296,KRAMER, It would put me at ease.,89
47297,GEORGE," Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.",89
47298,JERRY," Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men",89
47299,WAITRESS," Oh, you're getting it , it comes with your breakfast special.",89
47300,JERRY, Right you are.,89
47301,GEORGE," I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.",89
47302,WAITRESS,  I'll check.,89
47303,GEORGE,"  I don't believe it, she did it again!",89
47304,JERRY," Oh, she had an itch.",89
47305,GEORGE, She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.,89
47306,JERRY," By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.",89
47307,STREET TOUGH," Looking for something, lady?",89
47308,NANA, Isn't the Chemical Bank on this block?,89
47309,STREET TOUGH, The bank? It burned. It's gone!,89
47310,NANA, Oh dear.,89
47311,JERRY,  Hello?,89
47312,UNCLE LEO, Jerry? Hello.,89
47313,JERRY, Uncle Leo!,89
47314,UNCLE LEO," Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing.",89
47315,JERRY, Nana's missing?,89
47316,UNCLE LEO," I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't here. I called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. She hasn't left the apartment in twenty-five years!",89
47317,JERRY," I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.",89
47318,KRAMER," Yeah, that's right. You did.",89
47319,UNCLE LEO, What kind of checks?,89
47320,JERRY, I think Chemical Bank.,89
47321,KRAMER," Oh, they were Chemical.",89
47322,UNCLE LEO, Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway?,89
47323,JERRY," Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy.  I never should have cashed those checks!",89
47324,KRAMER," Hey, I didn't twist your arm.",89
47325,UNCLE LEO," Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke?",89
47326,JERRY," Just call me if you hear anything.  Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!",89
47327,KRAMER," Well, don't look at me.",89
47328,JERRY, It's your fault!,89
47329,KRAMER, My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.,89
47330,NOREEN," So anyway, it's caused a lot of problems. Dan thinks I'm interested in Jerry, he won't let up.",89
47331,ELAINE," I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.",89
47332,NOREEN," No, why?",89
47333,ELAINE," Well, you know, because he's a high talker.",89
47334,NOREEN," He does raise his voice occasionally, but that's normal.",89
47335,ELAINE," No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.",89
47336,NOREEN, Really?,89
47337,ELAINE, You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?,89
47338,NOREEN, I never noticed that.,89
47339,ELAINE," Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?",89
47340,NOREEN, Great. I'm going out with a man who sounds like a woman.,89
47341,ELAINE," Well, he looks like a man.",89
47342,NOREEN, Yeah.,89
47343,ELAINE, He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.,89
47344,NOREEN, I guess.,89
47345,ELAINE, I know he belches a lot.,89
47346,NOREEN," Well, that's something. So, Jerry thought I was flirting with him.",89
47347,ELAINE, Yeah.,89
47348,NOREEN,"  Hm. He's kind of a baritone, isn't he?",89
47349,ELAINE, What are you doing?,89
47350,NOREEN, I'm eating this cookie.,89
47351,ELAINE," No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just													think of that?",89
47352,NOREEN," No, I've seen people do it. I like it.",89
47353,DANNY TARTABULL," This isn't gonna take long, is it?",89
47354,GEORGE," Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.",89
47355,DANNY TARTABULL, I'm sure it's fine.,89
47356,GEORGE,  Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!,89
47357,DANNY TARTABULL, You sure?,89
47358,GEORGE," Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!",89
47359,DANNY TARTABULL, What are you doing?,89
47360,GEORGE, I'm following him.,89
47361,ELAINE," And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is													obsessed, he keeps leaving these annoying messages on my machine.",89
47362,JERRY, Would you?,89
47363,KRAMER, Any word from Nana?,89
47364,JERRY, No.,89
47365,ELAINE, Nana?,89
47366,JERRY," Yeah, my grandma's missing.",89
47367,ELAINE, Missing?,89
47368,JERRY, Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.,89
47369,ELAINE," Um, what does Nana sound like?",89
47370,JERRY," Like a grandmother, why?",89
47371,ELAINE, Well...,89
47372,JERRY," Oh, you hung up on my Nana?!",89
47373,ELAINE," I don't know, maybe.",89
47374,JERRY, You told Nana to drop dead?!,89
47375,ELAINE, It's possible.,89
47376,JERRY," Yes, it is!",89
47377,KRAMER," Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.",89
47378,JERRY, Alright.,89
47379,GEORGE, No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!,89
47380,DANNY TARTABULL, Want this last donut?,89
47381,GEORGE," No, you can have it.",89
47382,KRAMER," Jerry, where are all the tote bags?",89
47383,JERRY, I don't know.,89
47384,KRAMER," Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.",89
47385,KRISTIN," Jerry, this man wants to see you.",89
47386,JERRY, Leo?,89
47387,UNCLE LEO, Hello.,89
47388,JERRY, Uncle Leo! What are you doing here?,89
47389,UNCLE LEO, I wanted to tell you that your grandmother is fine.,89
47390,JERRY, Oh.,89

47395,JERRY," Yeah, yeah.",89
47396,KRISTIN,  Okay.,89
47397,UNCLE LEO," Why didn't you tell me you were a little short? Here. If anybody asks you where you got it, you don't know.",89
47398,JERRY," No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.",89
47399,UNCLE LEO, What are you talking about?,89
47400,JERRY, Please-,89
47401,UNCLE LEO, I want-,89
47402,JERRY, It's not necessary.,89
47403,UNCLE LEO," Jerry, would you please take it.",89
47404,JERRY," I can't, I can't take it.",89
47405,UNCLE LEO, I want you to have it!,89
47406,JERRY," Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!",89
47407,UNCLE LEO," Jerry, take the money!",89
47408,JERRY, I don't want it!!,89
47409,HIGH PITCHED VOICE," Jerry, open up. We need to talk.",89
47410,KRAMER, Who's that?,89
47411,JERRY, You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.,89
47412,KRAMER," Jerry, I'll take care of it.",89
47413,DAN, Is Jerry in there?,89
47414,KRAMER," Well, he can't be disturbed now.",89
47415,DAN, Well this situation is driving me crazy. He's all I think about. I can't get him out of my mind.,89
47416,KRAMER," I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.",89
47417,DAN, What?,89
47418,KRAMER," Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know.",89
47419,DAN," No, I don't.",89

47421,DAN," No, I'm not.",89
47422,GEORGE," I'll take care of this, Danny.",89
47423,GEORGE, Excuse me.,89
47424,MAN, What's the problem?,89
47425,GEORGE," I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.",89
47426,MAN, I did? Where?,89
47427,GEORGE," Outside of Manhattan, about an hour ago.",89
47428,MAN, Wow! Is that Danny Tartabull?,89
47429,GEORGE," That's right, of the New York Yankees.",89
47430,MAN, I'd like to shake his hand but I can't.,89
47431,JERRY," I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.",89
47432,JERRY, This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-,89
47433,KRAMER,  PBS pledge drive.,89
47434,NANA," Hello, I'd like to speak with Jerry.",89
47435,KRAMER," Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.",89
47436,NANA, This is his grandmother.,89
47437,KRAMER," Oh, uh, Nana. Hello.",89
47438,NANA," Tell Jerry I'm sorry, I'm going to have to write him some new checks.",89
47439,KRAMER," As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.",89
47440,JERRY," -programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'",89
47441,KRAMER, Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.,89
47442,JERRY, My Nana?,89
47443,KRAMER," And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!",89
47444,UNCLE LEO," She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!",89
47445,JERRY, I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.,89
47446,ELAINE, Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-,89
47447,JERRY," Yes, he is.",89
47448,ELAINE, You should show this to Georgie.,89
47449,JERRY, Yeah.,89
47450,WAITRESS,  Here's your knife and fork.,89
47451,JERRY," Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.",89
47452,ELAINE, I just don't get it.,89
47453,JERRY," You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.",89
47454,ELAINE, What is wrong with everybody?,89
47455,JERRY,"  Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!",89
47456,ELAINE,  What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!,89
47457,JERRY,  Good shave today...,90
47458,ELAINE,"  Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.",90
47459,JERRY, I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...,90
47460,ELAINE, Can we rest here a second.,90
47461,JERRY,"  Yeah, I guess.",90
47462,JERRY, ...So how's Noreen?,90
47463,ELAINE, Mmm! She's got a new boyfriend,90
47464,JERRY, Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...,90
47465,ELAINE," No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.",90
47466,JERRY, A Long Talker.,90
47467,ELAINE," Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone",90
47468,JERRY,  All right; let's move it out.,90
47469,JERRY," Hey, isn't that George's father?",90
47470,ELAINE," Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?",90
47471,JERRY, I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.,90
47472,ELAINE, That man he's with,90
47473,JERRY, I believe he is wearing a cape.,90
47474,ELAINE, Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?,90
47475,JERRY," Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.",90
47476,ELAINE," Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?",90
47477,JERRY," You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.",90
47478,JERRY," Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.",90
47479,JERRY, Oh! I got a message. ,90
47480,GEORGE,"  Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... ",90
47481,ELAINE, That sounds urgent...,90
47482,JERRY," Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.",90
47483,ELAINE, Donna Chang?,90
47484,JERRY,  I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.,90
47485,ELAINE, Isn't that a little racist?,90
47486,JERRY," If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!",90
47487,JERRY, So listen...,90
47488,KRAMER, Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water...  Who you talkin' to? ,90
47489,ELAINE, He's on with a Chinese woman.,90
47490,KRAMER," Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.",90
47491,ELAINE, You got a comfort problem there?,90
47492,KRAMER," No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.",90
47493,ELAINE, I thought you wore silk underwear.,90
47494,KRAMER," No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys.  My boys need a house!",90
47495,ELAINE,"  That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.",90
47496,KRAMER, Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?,90
47497,ELAINE, A lot!,90
47498,JERRY, I got a date!,90
47499,ELAINE, With the Chinese woman?!,90
47500,JERRY, She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.,90
47501,KRAMER, Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?,90
47502,JERRY," No, why should I? I wear boxers.",90
47503,KRAMER, You ever get a woman pregnant?,90
47504,JERRY," I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...",90
47505,KRAMER, What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?,90
47506,JERRY," Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!",90
47507,KRAMER, A LOT of 'em!  Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!,90
47508,JERRY," Well, I'm sure you're not... Totally Depleted.",90
47509,KRAMER, Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!,90
47510,JERRY, So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.,90
47511,KRAMER," Yeah, but then I'd have to...  well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??",90
47512,ELAINE," What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?",90
47513,ELAINE,  All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.,90
47514,JERRY, I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!,90
47515,ELAINE, She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?,90
47516,JERRY, She suggested it!,90
47517,ELAINE, I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese...,90
47518,JERRY, She's very assimilated.,90
47519,JERRY, Paul again?,90
47520,ELAINE,  You can't get one ring past him.,90
47521,GEORGE," Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!",90
47522,JERRY, I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!,90
47523,GEORGE, ...Huh?,90
47524,ELAINE," Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.",90
47525,GEORGE," Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?",90
47526,GEORGE, You didn't ask him?,90
47527,GEORGE,  You didn't say hello?,90
47528,ELAINE," Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.",90
47529,GEORGE, Why was he wearing a cape?,90
47530,GEORGE, Was my father wearing a cape?,90
47531,JERRY, No. Jacket and tie,90
47532,GEORGE, Huh... Cape...  What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?...  Why a cape? Hmm! ,90
47533,DOCTOR, The results of your sperm test are in.,90
47534,KRAMER, Oh?,90
47535,DOCTOR, Ummm... Are you planning to start a family?,90
47536,KRAMER," Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...",90
47537,DOCTOR," Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.",90
47538,KRAMER," Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate--",90
47539,DOCTOR, Ah--that's not necessarily true.,90
47540,KRAMER, What,90
47541,DOCTOR, There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.,90
47542,KRAMER," All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.",90
47543,DOCTOR, First thing,90
47544,KRAMER, All the time?,90
47545,DOCTOR, All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.,90
47546,KRAMER," Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.",90
47547,ELAINE," Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?!  Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna...  Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh...  Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. ",90
47548,HOSTESS," Please let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.",90
47549,JERRY," Yes, I will.",90
47550,GUY,  Do you mind?,90
47551,JERRY," No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.",90
47552,DONNA, Jerry.,90
47553,JERRY,  'scuse me?,90
47554,DONNA, Hi. Sorry I'm late.,90

47557,JERRY,  W-what do you mean?,90
47558,DONNA, I mean,90
47559,JERRY,  You're Donna Chang?,90
47560,DONNA, Did you think I was Chinese?...,90
47561,JERRY," Oh. No. What, you mean because of the ""Chang""?",90
47562,DONNA," Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.",90
47563,JERRY, I didn't think so.,90
47564,DONNA," Used to be ""Changstein.""",90
47565,ELAINE, She's not Chinese?,90
47566,JERRY, No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian.,90
47567,ELAINE, So. What is she?,90
47568,JERRY," Well, she's... like you.",90
47569,ELAINE,"  Oh, how disappointed you must have been. ",90
47570,JERRY," Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as ""Donna Chang""...",90
47571,ELAINE, So then why are you seeing her again...,90
47572,JERRY," Well, she is a woman.",90
47573,ELAINE," Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.",90
47574,JERRY, Really? ,90
47575,ELAINE," Well, maybe.",90
47576,JERRY," Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?",90
47577,ELAINE,  What do you mean?,90
47578,JERRY," Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?",90
47579,KRAMER," Here, take my Jockey shorts.",90
47580,ELAINE, Whoa! Whoa!,90

47582,KRAMER," Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.",90
47583,JERRY, Wha--you have a low sperm count?,90
47584,KRAMER," Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.",90
47585,JERRY, Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. ,90
47586,KRAMER," Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!",90
47587,JERRY, Look! I don't want 'em!,90
47588,KRAMER," All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--",90
47589,JERRY, I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!,90
47590,KRAMER," Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!",90
47591,KRAMER, What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! ,90
47592,JERRY,"  Well, I'm gonna have to move now.",90
47593,FRANK, Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.,90
47594,GEORGE, Plenty of mosquitoes.,90
47595,FRANK, Queens is full of mosquitoes.,90
47596,GEORGE," So, Dad...",90
47597,FRANK," Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.",90
47598,GEORGE,  Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!,90
47599,FRANK,  Your mother has to tell you every move I make?!,90
47600,GEORGE, Jerry and Elaine saw you.,90
47601,FRANK, They didn't say hello?,90
47602,GEORGE," Well, they were in a rush.",90
47603,FRANK," They couldn't just say hello?!... Oh, to hell with them.",90
47604,GEORGE," They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?...",90
47605,FRANK," Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--uh, supercilious.",90
47606,GEORGE," So Dad,--",90
47607,FRANK,  How could Jerry not say Hello?!!,90
47608,JERRY, Did they uncross the lines yet?,90
47609,DONNA," No, they can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.",90
47610,JERRY,"  Did you say, ""ridicurous""?",90
47611,DONNA, Ridiculous.,90
47612,JERRY,"  I thought you said... ""ridicurous."" ",90
47613,GEORGE, Hey-- ,90
47614,JERRY," Oh, what are you doing here?",90
47615,GEORGE," Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you...  had company.  Hiya, I'm George.",90
47616,DONNA, Oh! Hi!  I'm Donna Chang.  I just spoke to your mother before.,90
47617,GEORGE, You spoke to my mother?,90
47618,DONNA," She was trying to call you, but--",90
47619,JERRY, The rines are crossed?,90
47620,GEORGE," Did you say, ""The rines are crossed?""",90
47621,JERRY, Did I?,90
47622,DONNA,"  George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!",90
47623,GEORGE,  Yeah.,90
47624,DONNA," Anyway, I'm really sorry.",90
47625,GEORGE, Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?,90
47626,DONNA," Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.",90
47627,ELAINE," Ay, divorced. That's really too bad...",90
47628,JERRY," Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.",90
47629,GEORGE, Oh my God!  You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!,90
47630,JERRY," Gee, I never thought of that.",90
47631,GEORGE, Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day?  Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!,90
47632,ELAINE," Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?",90
47633,JERRY, Have you ever spent any time with these people...?,90
47634,GEORGE, You know what this has to do with?,90
47635,ELAINE, What?,90
47636,GEORGE, The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.,90
47637,JERRY, And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.,90
47638,GEORGE, All right Superman's the exception.,90
47639,KRAMER," Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me.  I've always had a thing for Noreen.",90
47640,ELAINE," No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.",90
47641,KRAMER," Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. ",90
47642,JERRY, Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...,90
47643,KRAMER," Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.",90
47644,JERRY, You went back to the Jockeys?,90
47645,KRAMER, Wrong again.,90
47646,JERRY,"  Oh, no.",90
47647,ELAINE, What? What?...,90
47648,JERRY," Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...",90
47649,ELAINE,  Eeaawww...,90
47650,JERRY," The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.",90
47651,KRAMER," Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!",90
47652,JERRY, Don't you need a little... help?,90
47653,KRAMER," Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered...  Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! ",90
47654,ELAINE, So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...,90
47655,NOREEN," Yeah, well... We're trying... But he just went insane there for a while...",90
47656,ELAINE," Oh, he went insane?...",90
47657,NOREEN," Believe it or not, Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over?",90
47658,ELAINE,"  Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!",90
47659,NOREEN,  I can't believe that was you...,90
47660,ELAINE,"  I'm really sorry, Noreen...",90
47661,NOREEN,  ...So you thought he was boring?,90
47662,ELAINE," Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.",90
47663,JERRY, What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!,90
47664,ELAINE,  I know--,90
47665,JERRY, First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.,90
47666,ELAINE," Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.",90
47667,JERRY," So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world",90
47668,ELAINE,  I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.,90
47669,JERRY," Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman",90
47670,JERRY, Yeah.,90
47671,DONNA, It's Donna Chang.,90
47672,JERRY,  Come on up. ,90
47673,ELAINE," Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...",90
47674,JERRY," Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?",90
47675,ELAINE,  Okay...,90
47676,JERRY," First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.",90
47677,ELAINE, She was lost...,90
47678,JERRY," Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!",90
47679,ELAINE," Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...",90
47680,JERRY, You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...,90
47681,ELAINE," If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!",90
47682,DONNA, Hi.,90
47683,JERRY," Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine...",90
47684,DONNA,"  Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.",90
47685,ELAINE,  Oh.,90
47686,JERRY, Why? What happened?,90
47687,DONNA," Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour and she changed her mind!!!",90
47688,JERRY, Wow! That's amazing!,90
47689,DONNA," Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner!",90
47690,ELAINE,  Huh.,90
47691,DONNA, She said you should come too.,90
47692,JERRY, Tonight?,90
47693,DONNA," Yeah--I just remembered, I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. ",90
47694,GEORGE, All right.  Let me just say one thing,90
47695,ESTELLE,  We're not getting divorced.,90
47696,FRANK, Your mother changed her mind... ,90
47697,GEORGE,  You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.,90
47698,FRANK," Yeah, we worked it out.",90
47699,GEORGE, All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?,90
47700,FRANK, He was my lawyer.,90
47701,GEORGE, Your lawyer wears a cape...?,90
47702,FRANK, Yeah. So what?,90
47703,GEORGE, Who wears a cape?,90
47704,FRANK, He's very independent; he doesn't follow the trends.,90
47705,ESTELLE, He looks ridiculous in that thing...,90
47706,FRANK,  You have no eye for fashion!!!,90
47707,ESTELLE,  I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!,90
47708,GEORGE, All right! Come on! Let's not fight.,90
47709,ESTELLE, Georgie's right. ,90
47710,GEORGE,  ehh.  So what made you change your mind?,90
47711,ESTELLE, It was that Chinese woman.,90
47712,JERRY, So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?,90
47713,DONNA, I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.,90
47714,JERRY," Confucius, huh?",90
47715,DONNA, Yeah.,90
47716,JERRY,"  You know, you're not Chinese...",90

47736,ELAINE,  Alright--would you just put her on?,90
47737,KRAMER," Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...",90
47738,ELAINE, YOU feel?,90
47739,KRAMER," That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...",90
47740,ELAINE," What, are you insane?!",90
47741,KRAMER," From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...",90
47742,ELAINE, Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?,90
47743,KRAMER, Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army... There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...,90
47744,ELAINE,  Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!,90
47745,KRAMER," Can't help ya, kid.",90

47751,ESTELLE, Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!,90
47752,DONNA, I'm sorry...?,90
47753,ESTELLE, Well... then... that changes everything!,90
47754,GEORGE, What?!,90
47755,ESTELLE, She's not Chinese; I was duped!!,90
47756,GEORGE, So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!,90
47757,ESTELLE, I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! ,90
47758,GEORGE,  Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!,90
47759,FRANK,  You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!,90
47760,JERRY,"  You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...",90
47761,ELAINE," So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!",90
47762,JERRY, Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. ,90
47763,ELAINE,"  You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.",90
47764,ELAINE,"  hu_uh,  You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.",90
47765,JERRY," Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...",90
47766,GEORGE," Oh, it had to happen!!",90
47767,JERRY, Hey.,90
47768,GEORGE," I knew it!!  I predicted it!  Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played ""Clue""! All day with this! [Kew Gardens ]",90
47769,KRAMER,"  Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! ",90
47770,NOREEN,  Who are you?!,90
47771,MAN, I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. ,90
47772,JERRY,"The love seat, that's a nice little item, there...I guess some guy thought, 'Well, if we can't get them to sit closer to us, why not just shorten the furniture?' My other favorite furniture brand is the La-Z-Boy. This is very flattering to the prospective customer, isn't it? Why don't we just call it the 'half-conscious deadbeat with no job, home all day, eating Cheetos and watching TV' recliner? I mean, it goes back so far, that thing...I mean, it's like, 'Go to bed already! It's over! You're wiped!'",91
47773,JERRY," So, she got you to join a book club?",91
47774,GEORGE, I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.,91
47775,JERRY," Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence.  Hey, what about this one?",91
47776,GEORGE," Nah, I don't like that one.",91
47777,JERRY," So, what's your first book?",91
47778,GEORGE," ""Breakfast At Tiffany's."" 90 pages. ",91
47779,JERRY," It's kinda old, isn't it?",91
47780,GEORGE, They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.,91
47781,JERRY ," Oh, sure...Truman Capote.",91
47782,GEORGE, He's a great writer.,91
47783,JERRY," Oh, yeah.",91
47784,GEORGE, Did you ever read anything by him?,91
47785,JERRY, No. You?,91
47786,GEORGE, Nah.,91
47787,JERRY ," Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for.  Oh, yeah!",91
47788,ELAINE," Hey, what's going on?",91
47789,JERRY," New couch, baby!",91
47790,ELAINE, New couch? Why?,91
47791,JERRY," I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.",91
47792,ELAINE , Hello.,91
47793,CARL, Hello.,91
47794,ELAINE," Oh, let me get the door for you.  Ooh, be careful!",91
47795,JERRY," Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.",91
47796,ELAINE, What are you doing with your old couch?,91
47797,JERRY," Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?",91
47798,ELAINE," Yeah, I'll take it.",91
47799,JERRY," Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.",91
47800,ELAINE," Yes, they can. ",91
47801,KRAMER, Hey! Couch is comin.',91
47802,JERRY, It's here!,91
47803,KRAMER," Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.",91
47804,JERRY , Yeah. So do I.,91
47805,KRAMER, Ooh! Remember Poppie?,91
47806,JERRY," Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?",91
47807,KRAMER," Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?",91
47808,JERRY, Yeah.,91
47809,ELAINE, What was that again?,91
47810,KRAMER," It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?",91
47811,ELAINE ," Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!",91
47812,JERRY, What made you resurrect that old idea?,91
47813,KRAMER," Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the ""old"" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.",91
47814,ELAINE," I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.",91
47815,JERRY, I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?,91
47816,KRAMER," That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.",91
47817,ELAINE," Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon!",91
47818,KRAMER," Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance.  You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.",91
47819,JERRY," Oh, Kramer, I -",91
47820,JERRY," Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?",91
47821,ELAINE," Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.",91
47822,JERRY," Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.",91
47823,CARL , Sign here.,91
47824,ELAINE ," Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.",91
47825,CARL, Sure.,91
47826,ELAINE," 'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?",91
47827,CARL," Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in.",91
47828,ELAINE," Oh, goody. Okay, well uh......I'll see you chumps later. ",91
47829,KRAMER, Did you offer those guys a drink?,91
47830,JERRY," Uh, no. Should I have?",91
47831,KRAMER, What kind of a person are you?,91
47832,JERRY, I don't know.,91
47833,GEORGE," Okay. ""Breakfast At Tiffany's."" ",91
47834,ELAINE," So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, ""Do you date moving men?""",91
47835,JERRY, Ah ha...,91
47836,ELAINE, You wanna know what I said?,91
47837,JERRY, I can't wait.,91
47838,ELAINE," ""I do now.""",91
47839,JERRY, Clever.,91
47840,ELAINE, Is that something?,91
47841,JERRY, Yes.,91
47842,ELAINE, Is that something?,91
47843,JERRY," You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.",91
47844,ELAINE," Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.",91
47845,JERRY," So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?",91
47846,ELAINE, Yes.,91
47847,JERRY," Well, would you apologize for me? ",91
47848,POPPIE," Hello! Jerry, so good to see you again! ",91
47849,JERRY ," Hello, Poppie. This is Elaine.",91
47850,ELAINE," Nice to meet you, Poppie.",91
47851,POPPIE, Let me show you to your table.  Your duck is cooking as we speak. It is so succulent...so succulent!,91
47852,JERRY," Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.",91
47853,POPPIE," Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well.",91
47854,ELAINE," Well, your mother must be very proud of you.",91
47855,POPPIE," My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas.",91
47856,JERRY," So, what's good tonight?",91
47857,ELAINE," Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.",91
47858,JERRY," Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.",91
47859,ELAINE, Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.,91
47860,JERRY, Why not?,91
47861,ELAINE," Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.",91
47862,JERRY," So, you won't eat the pizza?",91
47863,ELAINE, No way.,91
47864,JERRY, Really.,91
47865,ELAINE, Yeah.,91
47866,JERRY," Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?",91
47867,ELAINE," Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.",91
47868,JERRY, Really!,91
47869,ELAINE, Yeah. That's right.,91
47870,JERRY," Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? ",91
47871,POPPIE," Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped.",91
47872,JERRY," Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?",91
47873,POPPIE," When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child...",91
47874,JERRY," Oh, boy.",91
47875,POPPIE," ...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently.",91
47876,ELAINE , Well...Poppie. I think differently.,91
47877,POPPIE, And what gives you the right to do that?,91
47878,ELAINE ," The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.",91
47879,WOMAN AT NEXT TABLE ," I heard that. Let's go, Henry.",91
47880,HENRY, But we just got here...,91
47881,WOMAN AT ANOTHER TABLE," I'm with you, Poppie!",91
47882,WOMAN AT YET ANOTHER TABLE , Let's go!,91
47883,ELAINE , And I am not coming back!,91
47884,POPPIE, You're not welcome!,91
47885,JERRY," Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. ",91
47886,JERRY," Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.",91
47887,GEORGE, I'm sorry I missed it.,91
47888,JERRY," Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault.  So, how's the book coming?  I say, how's the book comin'?",91
47889,GEORGE, Oh...pretty good.,91
47890,JERRY," So, what's it about?",91
47891,GEORGE," Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.",91
47892,JERRY, Holly Go-Lightly.,91
47893,GEORGE," Yeah, she's quite a character.",91
47894,JERRY," Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?",91
47895,GEORGE, No.,91
47896,JERRY, Big surprise.,91
47897,GEORGE," I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.",91
47898,JERRY," You're not very bright, are you?",91
47899,GEORGE," No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.",91
47900,JERRY, Why don't you rent the movie?,91
47901,GEORGE," 'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. ",91
47902,KRAMER , So...how was the dinner last night?,91
47903,JERRY, Oh...well...,91
47904,KRAMER," Did you enjoy the duck?  Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.",91
47905,ELAINE , Oh...well...,91
47906,KRAMER," Alright, what did you do to Poppie?",91
47907,ELAINE, Nothing.,91
47908,KRAMER," Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.",91
47909,ELAINE, What's wrong with him?,91
47910,KRAMER, I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later.  It would be nice if you got him something. ,91
47911,JERRY, We should get him something.,91
47912,ELAINE, Yeah. You're right.,91
47913,ELAINE," Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day.  So, what do you think of my conversation?",91
47914,CARL," Not much!  I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture.",91
47915,ELAINE, You don't have any furniture?,91
47916,CARL," No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it. ",91
47917,ELAINE," Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?",91
47918,CARL, Yeah! No heavy lifting. ,91
47919,KRAMER," Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.",91
47920,POPPIE , What's this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?!,91
47921,KRAMER," Why, what...?",91
47922,POPPIE," Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?",91
47923,KRAMER," Well, we're not very close.",91
47924,POPPIE, They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland.,91
47925,KRAMER," Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?",91
47926,POPPIE," Oh, very good ducks.",91
47927,ELAINE, I'm in looove!,91
47928,JERRY, Whoa!,91
47929,ELAINE," This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!",91
47930,JERRY, Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?,91
47931,ELAINE," No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! ",91
47932,JERRY, No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?,91
47933,ELAINE ," Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.",91
47934,JERRY, Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?,91
47935,ELAINE , What?,91
47936,JERRY, What is his stand...on abortion?,91
47937,ELAINE," Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.",91
47938,JERRY, How do you know?,91
47939,ELAINE," Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.",91
47940,JERRY," Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.",91
47941,GEORGE, I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.,91
47942,CLERK ," Uh, this is out. Someone has it.",91
47943,GEORGE," Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.",91
47944,CLERK," Well, I could put it on reserve for you, if you'd like.",91
47945,GEORGE, Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.,91
47946,CLERK," Oh, sorry. We can't do that.",91
47947,GEORGE," Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.",91
47948,CLERK, I don't think so. It doesn't work that way.,91
47949,VOICE ON INTERCOM, Yes?,91
47950,GEORGE," Uh, excuse me, are you Joe Temple?",91
47951,INTERCOM, Yes.,91
47952,GEORGE," Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?",91
47953,KRAMER, Hey.,91
47954,JERRY," Hey, what's happenin.'",91
47955,KRAMER," Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.",91
47956,JERRY, You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.,91
47957,KRAMER," Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. ",91
47958,JERRY," Okay. Hi, Poppie.",91
47959,POPPIE, Hello.,91
47960,JERRY," I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.",91
47961,POPPIE," That's fine. If you just give me my duck money, I'll be on my way.",91
47962,JERRY, Okay. I'll get it. ,91
47963,KRAMER," Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating.  What, are you tired, Poppie?",91
47964,POPPIE, No.,91
47965,KRAMER," Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?",91
47966,POPPIE," Kramer, did I ever tell you about my mother? My mother -",91
47967,JERRY ," Here you go.  Anyway, I'm sorry again about the......the...the...",91
47968,POPPIE, The what? ,91
47969,JERRY, ...the...the...,91
47970,KRAMER , So long. I'll see you tonight.,91
47971,JERRY ," Kramer, Kramer, what is this?!",91
47972,KRAMER, What is what?,91
47973,JERRY, This puddle on my sofa!,91
47974,KRAMER, What puddle?,91
47975,JERRY , That puddle! ,91
47976,KRAMER, I don't know.,91
47977,JERRY , Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS!  Poppie peed on my sofa!!,91
47978,KRAMER, Are you sure?,91
47979,JERRY," Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!",91
47980,KRAMER, I'm sure it'll come out.,91
47981,JERRY," I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!",91
47982,KRAMER," Ah, you're making too much of it.",91
47983,JERRY ," Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.",91
47984,KRAMER, Right!,91
47985,GEORGE," Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.",91
47986,JOE," Well, I was going to watch it with my daughter. She likes Audrey Hepburn very much.",91
47987,GEORGE, She was a delicate flower.,91
47988,JOE, Why didn't you just read the book?,91
47989,GEORGE," Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... ",91
47990,JOE," Remy, this is George. Would you mind if he watched Breakfast At Tiffany's with us? ",91

48001,CARL, What friend?,91
48002,ELAINE," Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. ",91
48003,CARL," You know, someday...we're going to get enough people in the Supreme Court to change that law.",91
48004,GEORGE," So, anything to uh, nosh?",91
48005,JOE, What did you want?,91
48006,GEORGE, Popcorn?,91

48008,GEORGE," Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.",91
48009,REMY," Well, we don't.",91
48010,GEORGE," You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.",91
48011,JOE , Here's some nuts.,91
48012,GEORGE, Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.,91
48013,REMY ," Can we watch the movie now, Daddy? ",91
48014,GEORGE," Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'",91
48015,JOE, The lights are fine. ,91
48016,KRAMER ," See, anybody can do this. ",91
48017,POPPIE, Use your wrist! It's all in the wrist.  Not too high!,91

48021,POPPIE, Wait a second...what is that?,91
48022,KRAMER, It's cucumbers.,91
48023,POPPIE," No, no. You can't put cucumbers on a pizza.",91
48024,KRAMER," Well, why not? I like cucumbers.",91
48025,POPPIE, That's not a pizza. It'll taste terrible.,91
48026,KRAMER," But that's the idea, you make your own pie.",91
48027,POPPIE," Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate!",91
48028,KRAMER, What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?,91
48029,POPPIE, Because it's a pizza!,91
48030,KRAMER, It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!,91
48031,POPPIE, It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough!,91
48032,KRAMER," No, it isn't!",91
48033,POPPIE," Yes, it is!",91
48034,JOE," Hey, honey.",91

48038,GEORGE , Joe...could you...,91
48039,GEORGE," You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.",91
48040,JOE, This is George Costanza.,91
48041,GEORGE , This is very hard to follow with all the talking.,91
48042,JOE," I'll pause it, okay? ",91
48043,GEORGE, Any more grape juice? ,91
48044,REMY, He's in some book club.,91

48047,REMY, What?,91
48048,GEORGE," C'mon, you took my seat.",91
48049,REMY, It's not your seat.,91
48050,GEORGE," I was sitting there, c'mon.",91
48051,REMY, You didn't save it.,91
48052,GEORGE, I had the arm! Joe...,91
48053,JOE, What's the difference?,91

48058,GEORGE, Joe...,91
48059,ELAINE, Oh my god.,91
48060,JERRY, You see?!,91
48061,ELAINE," So, you're gonna get a new couch?",91
48062,JERRY," Well, I guess I have no choice.",91
48063,ELAINE, Do you want your old couch back?,91
48064,JERRY, I was hoping you'd offer.  Yeah?,91
48065,INTERCOM, It's the movers.,91
48066,JERRY, 'Kay. ,91
48067,ELAINE, Who's that?,91
48068,JERRY," Your boyfriend, he's taking it out.",91
48069,ELAINE," No, no, he's not my boyfriend.",91
48070,JERRY, Why?,91
48071,ELAINE, Take a guess.,91
48072,JERRY," Oh, really. ",91
48073,ELAINE, Hi.,91
48074,CARL, Hi.,91
48075,JERRY," Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.",91
48076,CARL, Today?,91
48077,JERRY, Could you?,91
48078,CARL, Sure.,91
48079,ELAINE , What are you doing with this couch?,91
48080,JERRY, George is taking it.,91
48081,ELAINE, Did you tell him it was peed on?,91
48082,JERRY," He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.",91
48083,CARL," I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.",91
48084,ELAINE," Yeah, me too.",91
48085,CARL, It's just too bad.,91
48086,ELAINE, Yeah. It is.,91
48087,CARL," Well, I better get this couch back to Jerry's.",91
48088,ELAINE, Can I offer you anything to drink?,91
48089,CARL ," Yeah, sure.",91
48090,ELAINE , All I've got is grape juice.,91
48091,CARL, Throw it!,91
48092,CARL, The couch!,91
48093,MARIE ," She didn't want the constraints of any relationship, that's why she got rid of the cat. The most important thing in Holly's life was her independence.",91
48094,GEORGE," Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.",91
48095,MARIE, George...Fred's gay.,91
48096,JERRY," I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? ""Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!""",92
48097,JERRY," I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" thing.",92
48098,GEORGE, I think she finds my stupidity charming.,92
48099,JERRY, As we all do.,92
48100,GEORGE," Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.",92
48101,JERRY," Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?",92
48102,GEORGE," Yeah, I'll zip in, ""How do you do?"", zip out. She'll love me.",92
48103,JERRY, You're good with the mothers.,92
48104,GEORGE," Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.",92
48105,JERRY, Maybe you should date the mothers.,92
48106,GEORGE," Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.",92
48107,JERRY," Oh, you got something goin'.",92
48108,GEORGE, Yeah.,92
48109,KRAMER,  Hey.,92
48110,GEORGE, Hey! ,92
48111,KRAMER," Hey, you got a hammer?",92
48112,JERRY, What do you need a hammer for?,92
48113,KRAMER," Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.",92
48114,JERRY," Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.",92
48115,KRAMER," No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?",92
48116,JERRY," Nah, I don't think so.",92
48117,KRAMER,"  George, you wanna go for a ride?",92
48118,GEORGE,  Nah.,92
48119,KRAMER," Oh, COME ON!",92
48120,JERRY," Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?",92
48121,KRAMER," All right, I've had it with you two. ",92
48122,JERRY," Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?",92
48123,KRAMER, A gymnast!,92
48124,JERRY," Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.",92
48125,KRAMER," A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.",92
48126,JERRY," Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.",92
48127,KRAMER,"  ""Bailing""?",92
48128,JERRY," Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.",92
48129,KRAMER," Jerry, you should pay that price.",92
48130,JERRY," She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?",92
48131,KRAMER, Ch- oo-... what?,92
48132,GEORGE,"  A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.",92
48133,JERRY,  What is this?,92
48134,GEORGE," What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on.",92
48135,JERRY,"  ""Back on""? What was it doing off?",92
48136,GEORGE," I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the ""office"".",92
48137,JERRY,  What for?,92
48138,GEORGE," Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.",92
48139,JERRY," Unbuttoned, or all the way off?",92
48140,GEORGE," ALL the way, baby!",92
48141,JERRY, Of course.,92
48142,KRAMER,  Yeow! Whoa.,92
48143,JERRY," What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.",92
48144,KRAMER,"  Yeah, yeah, yeah...",92
48145,JERRY,  You always take the shirt off?,92
48146,GEORGE, Always.,92
48147,JERRY," Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.",92
48148,MR. PITT," Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people.",92
48149,ELAINE, What meeting?,92
48150,MR. PITT," I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs, and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek.",92
48151,ELAINE, Oh! ,92
48152,MR. PITT,  Are you using a fountain pen?,92
48153,ELAINE, Yes?,92
48154,MR. PITT, They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.,92
48155,ELAINE," All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.",92
48156,KRAMER, Elaine?,92
48157,ELAINE," Come in, come in!",92
48158,KRAMER," Yeah.  Yah, huh?",92
48159,ELAINE," Ah, right there, yeah.",92
48160,KRAMER,"  Yeah, that's...",92
48161,ELAINE," Kramer, it's...",92
48162,KRAMER, There she blows! ,92
48163,ELAINE," Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?",92
48164,KRAMER," Oh, these are nice corners, huh?",92
48165,MR. PITT," Elaine, did I hear...  Oh, this is very odd.",92
48166,KRAMER,"  Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.",92
48167,MR. PITT," Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?",92
48168,KRAMER," Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then...  Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!",92
48169,MR. PITT, I don't see it.,92
48170,KRAMER," Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...",92
48171,MR. PITT, I still don't see it.,92
48172,ELAINE," Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.",92
48173,KRAMER, Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.,92
48174,MR. PITT," A spaceship, where?",92
48175,KRAMER,"  Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused.  Waahh! Oh, mama!",92
48176,ELAINE," Kramer, what's wrong?",92
48177,KRAMER, Mama!,92
48178,ELAINE," Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?",92
48179,KRAMER," I think I gotta go to the doctor!  Oh, mama!",92
48180,MR. PITT,  How long does it usually take?,92
48181,MRS. ENRIGHT," Oh, George, it is so nice to finally meet you. And I'm sorry we've kept Lindsay so long.",92
48182,LINDSAY, Mother...,92
48183,GEORGE," Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.",92
48184,MRS. ENRIGHT, Oh? Are you and your family close?,92
48185,GEORGE,"  Very close, yes. Almost painfully close.",92
48186,LINDSAY," Mother, I'm going to walk Nana and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator. George, do you mind waiting just one more minute?",92
48187,GEORGE," Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait!  Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA!  Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?",92
48188,MRS. ENRIGHT, Can I offer you anything to eat?,92
48189,GEORGE," Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?",92
48190,MRS. ENRIGHT," Oh no, George, you don't have to...",92
48191,GEORGE," No, I know I don't have to, I want to.",92
48192,MRS. ENRIGHT," George, you are such a gentleman.",92
48193,GEORGE," I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright.  Here we go, all right.",92
48194,MRS. ENRIGHT,  Oh...,92
48195,GEORGE, Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!,92
48196,ELAINE,"  Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!",92
48197,MR. PITT, Where is it?,92
48198,ELAINE,  Right here.,92
48199,MR. PITT, I'm looking there!,92
48200,ELAINE," No, no, unfocus.",92
48201,MR. PITT, I am unfocused!,92
48202,ELAINE,"  Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down.  Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.",92
48203,MR. PITT,  Meeting?,92
48204,ELAINE," Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?",92
48205,MR. PITT, Why don't you go for me?,92
48206,ELAINE, How can I go?,92
48207,MR. PITT," Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report.",92
48208,ELAINE," Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.",92
48209,MR. PITT," Oh, DAMN this thing!",92
48210,JERRY,"  So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.",92
48211,KATYA, Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating.,92
48212,JERRY," He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. ""I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!""",92
48213,KATYA, And you could not refuse.,92
48214,JERRY," No, you'd have to be crazy.",92
48215,KATYA, He was a very bad dictator.,92
48216,JERRY," Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.",92
48217,JERRY, So lemme get this straight,92
48218,GEORGE," No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!",92
48219,JERRY, Was it in the trash?,92
48220,GEORGE, Yes.,92
48221,JERRY, Then it was trash.,92
48222,GEORGE," It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.",92
48223,JERRY, But it was in the cylinder!,92
48224,GEORGE, Above the rim.,92
48225,JERRY," Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.",92
48226,GEORGE, It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.,92
48227,JERRY, Was it eaten?,92
48228,GEORGE, One little bite.,92
48229,JERRY," Well, that's garbage.",92
48230,GEORGE, But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!,92
48231,JERRY," Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.",92
48232,JERRY, Hey!,92
48233,KRAMER, Hey.,92
48234,JERRY, What's with you?,92
48235,KRAMER, I got a stone.,92
48236,JERRY, What stone?,92
48237,KRAMER, A kidney stone.,92
48238,JERRY," What is that, anyway?",92
48239,KRAMER," It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!",92
48240,JERRY," Oh, that's gotta hurt.",92
48241,ARONSON," Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger, including the stock swap.",92
48242,ELAINE," Ah. The ""stock swap"". Let's swap some stock. ",92
48243,BECK," And if you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt, and tell him we expect to be in full-scale production by the spring.",92
48244,ELAINE," All right.  Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?",92
48245,BECK, Moland Spring.,92
48246,ELAINE,"  ""Moland""?",92
48247,ARONSON," Yes, we combined Morgan and Poland.",92
48248,ELAINE," Yeah, I know, but... ""Moland""? I wouldn't drink anything called ""Moland"".",92
48249,ARONSON, But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.,92
48250,ELAINE," Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?",92
48251,ARONSON,  We've got to do something about that name.,92
48252,GEORGE,"  No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time.  It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye.  I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.",92
48253,JERRY, Good for you.,92
48254,GEORGE," Yes, good for me!",92
48255,JERRY," Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.",92
48256,GEORGE," Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!",92
48257,KRAMER,  Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! ,92
48258,JERRY," Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.",92
48259,KRAMER," Jerry, what is your problem?",92
48260,JERRY," Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.",92
48261,KRAMER," All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?",92
48262,JERRY, No.,92
48263,KRAMER, Tantric yoga?,92
48264,JERRY, No.,92
48265,KRAMER," Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!",92
48266,JERRY," Boy, you can really talk some trash.  I guess that's better than eating it.",92
48267,KRAMER," All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? ",92
48268,JERRY, All right.,92
48269,GEORGE, Did you pass your stone yet?,92
48270,KRAMER, Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.,92
48271,JERRY,"  Hey, that's her!",92
48272,KRAMER," Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her.  Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing!  Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape?  Well, I'll take that as a yes.",92
48273,JERRY,"  Well, here we are.",92
48274,KATYA, Yes. We are here.,92
48275,JERRY," How did you stay on that beam like that?  I mean, it's only this wide!",92
48276,KATYA, I can balance myself in any position.,92
48277,KATYA," It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's body. Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics.",92
48278,JERRY, Oh boy...,92
48279,JERRY," I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a ""magical world"" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.",92
48280,ELAINE," Well, what did you think she was gonna do?",92
48281,JERRY," Well, you know. I mean... I dunno.",92
48282,ELAINE," No, what?",92
48283,JERRY," Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...",92
48284,ELAINE," What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...",92
48285,JERRY," You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...",92
48286,ELAINE," Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?",92
48287,JERRY," Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.",92
48288,KRAMER, You mean like the uneven parallel bars?,92
48289,JERRY," See, again, I really don't feel that...",92
48290,ELAINE, The balance beam?,92
48291,JERRY, Could we stop?,92
48292,ELAINE,  Not the pommel horse?,92
48293,JERRY, All right. Let's just drop it.,92
48294,JERRY, So lemme ask you this,92
48295,ELAINE," I dunno, at least three weeks.",92
48296,JERRY,"  Oh, great.",92
48297,ELAINE," Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.",92
48298,JERRY, Between Poland and Morgan?,92
48299,ELAINE, Yeah. Started a big name controversy.,92
48300,JERRY, Kramer! The stone!,92
48301,JERRY," What happened, did you pass the stone?",92
48302,KRAMER,"  No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.",92
48303,GEORGE,"  ""...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie...""  You call this coffee? ",92
48304,MAN IN CAR, Hey! What the hell was that?!,92

48306,MAN IN CAR, Clean that up!,92
48307,GEORGE," Oh, sure. Of course.  Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second.  Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.",92
48308,MRS. ENRIGHT, ,92
48309,GEORGE, Look at this sparkle.  Mrs. Enright!  Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!,92
48310,GEORGE,"  No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. ",92
48311,JERRY, Strike two!,92
48312,GEORGE, You think I'm going down?,92
48313,JERRY, You're behind in the count.,92
48314,GEORGE, I know.,92
48315,KRAMER,"  Hey, what are you doing later?",92
48316,JERRY," I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.",92
48317,KRAMER," Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time",92
48318,JERRY," If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.",92
48319,KRAMER," All right, where you going?",92
48320,JERRY, We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.,92
48321,KRAMER," Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon.",92
48322,JERRY," Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!",92
48323,KRAMER," No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.",92
48324,JERRY," Yeah, well you're going.",92
48325,KRAMER," Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!",92
48326,MR. PITT,  I didn't send you over there to complain about the name.,92
48327,ELAINE," Well, I couldn't help it. ""Moland Spring""?",92
48328,MR. PITT," I like the name ""Moland"". I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating!",92
48329,ELAINE," Well, I'm so sorry! I-",92
48330,MR. PITT," Well, I'm going riding. I haven't been on Jenny for three days, all because of this blasted painting.  Elaine?",92
48331,ELAINE," Oh, sorry.  Hello?",92
48332,MR. PITT,  Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah!,92
48333,KATYA," So, Jerry, you're enjoying the circus?",92
48334,JERRY," ""Greatest Show on Earth""!",92
48335,KATYA," My father used to take me to the circus. When the elephants came by, he would scream curses at them, blaming them for all the ills of society.",92
48336,JERRY," Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.",92
48337,KATYA," Ah, Misha!",92
48338,MISHA, Katya!,92
48339,KATYA," Misha, this is Jerry.",92
48340,MISHA," Ah, yes. The ""co-me-dian"", eh? ",92
48341,KATYA, ,92
48342,ELAINE,"  Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on.  Mr. Pitt!",92
48343,MR. PITT,  I think I'm on to something!,92
48344,ELAINE, Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!,92
48345,MR. PITT," You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. You want DEEP focus!",92
48346,ELAINE,"  Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just...  Yeah, I've got it...  Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there.  Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!",92
48347,MR. PITT, I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy?,92
48348,ELAINE,"  No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it!  Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!",92
48349,MR. PITT," Hmm, what's happened to me?  When's the meeting?",92
48350,ELAINE, In about twenty minutes.,92
48351,MR. PITT, Oh!  Do I have time to change?,92
48352,ELAINE," Um, no.",92
48353,MR. PITT," Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there.",92
48354,ELAINE," Uh, Mr. Pitt...",92
48355,MR. PITT, Yes?,92
48356,ELAINE," Um, there's a just... ",92
48357,MR. PITT,  Is that ink?,92
48358,ELAINE, No?,92
48359,GEORGE," Well, here we are.",92
48360,LINDSAY, Do you want to come in? My mother's having a little party.,92
48361,GEORGE, Maybe I could just use the bathroom.,92
48362,LINDSAY, Sure.,92
48363,ANNOUNCER,"  Ladies and gentlemen, could I direct your attention to the center ring, where the incomparable Misha will balance ten stories above the circus floor on a wire no wider than a human thumb.",92
48364,MISHA, It is time.,92
48365,JERRY," Well, break a leg.",92
48366,JERRY," Eh, show biz...",92
48367,ANNOUNCER," Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Misha!",92
48368,JERRY," Boy, those capes are really coming back.",92
48369,PARTY GUEST,"  Oh, sorry I took so long. They've got one of those 3-D art posters in there.  It's mesmerizing.",92
48370,JERRY, What is that sound?,92
48371,KATYA,  It is horrible!,92
48372,GEORGE," Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!",92
48373,MR. PITT," I have been accused of wrong-doing. But these false accusations will not deter us. We WILL annex Poland by the Spring, at any cost! AND... our stock will rise HIGH! ",92
48374,KATYA, He'll be all right. I must go and be with Misha now. I don't want you to come with me.,92
48375,JERRY," Oh, why not?",92
48376,KATYA, It has been three days since our night together. Misha said that was all the time I needed to put in.,92
48377,JERRY, Really?,92
48378,KATYA," In my country, they speak of a man so virile, so potent, that to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of such sensual delights most women dare not dream of. This man is known as the ""Comedian"". You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, but you are no Comedian. ",92
48379,WAITRESS," O.K. Cowboys,  What'll you have?",93
48380,JERRY," I’ll have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon.",93
48381,GEORGE," And ah, I’ll have the bacon club without the turkey. ",93
48382,WAITRESS," George, don't make me get tough with you.",93
48383,GEORGE," Why, you think you can, beat me up?",93

48385,GEORGE," Huh, nggh [snort] Stop. ",93
48386,WAITRESS, You don't want bacon I’ll surprise you. ,93
48387,GEORGE," Wow, is she not terrific?",93
48388,JERRY, She does have a way.,93
48389,GEORGE," You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying that?",93
48390,JERRY, Well they do work on tips.,93
48391,GEORGE," “George, don't make me get tough with you.” Whu, hu, hu, hu huuuu  Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me?",93
48392,JERRY," Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet.",93
48393,GEORGE," Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like.",93
48394,JERRY, The omelet. Damn.,93
48395,GEORGE, Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible?,93
48396,JERRY, No.,93
48397,GEORGE, No.,93
48398,JERRY, Not possible.,93
48399,GEORGE, Not possible.,93

48410,GEORGE, Flying him in? How long’s he staying for?,93
48411,ELAINE, It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.,93
48412,GEORGE, All this in 5 days. Hmm.,93

48488,GEORGE, I did it! It's all done!,93
48489,JERRY, Hey. ,93
48490,GEORGE," I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, I’m much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure.",93

48492,GEORGE, There ya go.,93
48493,ELAINE, So the trip was good?,93
48494,SIMON," Yes  Apart from that, dreadful airline food. It tends to reek havoc with my stomach.",93
48495,ELAINE," You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. ",93
48496,SIMON, That's probably because of ... [muttering],93
48497,ELAINE, What?,93
48498,SIMON, What?,93
48499,ELAINE," Yeah, what?",93
48500,SIMON, [sighs],93
48501,ELAINE, What?,93
48502,SIMON," Where I come from, we don't say “What?” It's proper to say “Pardon?”",93
48503,ELAINE, Huh.  This should be interesting.,93
48504,SIMON, Pardon?,93
48505,ELAINE, Nothing.,93
48506,KELLY," So then about a year ago I started selling, these funky little hair clips. It's going pretty good. I make them in my apartment.",93
48507,KELLY," I’m just doing this waitress thing for a while, because I wanted to go to Europe this summer…",93
48508,GEORGE,  ahh.,93
48509,KELLY, …and I could use a few extra ... Careful,93
48510,GEORGE," Oh. It's just horse manure  Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word “manure.” You know, it's, it's “nure,” which is good. and a “ma” in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, “manure” is actually pretty refreshing.",93
48511,KELLY, That's a nice watch George.,93
48512,GEORGE, Yeah.,93
48513,KELLY," You know, my boyfriend has the same one.",93
48514,GEORGE, Huh. Really?,93
48515,KELLY," Yeah, he loves watches. He's a real watch freak.",93
48516,GEORGE," Well, how about that?",93
48517,KELLY, Ooh look out.  You stepped right in it.,93
48518,GEORGE," Yes, I sure did.",93
48519,JERRY, So you just pretended it didn’t bother you?,93
48520,GEORGE," What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?",93
48521,JERRY," Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.",93
48522,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. “Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak.” We-e-ell that's fabulous. ",93
48523,JERRY, Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?,93
48524,GEORGE," I said, “would you like to go for a walk or something.”",93
48525,JERRY," Oh, a walk, well --",93
48526,GEORGE," Or something. I said, “Or Something!”",93
48527,JERRY," Or something. Yeah, that's a date.",93
48528,GEORGE,  There you go.,93
48529,JERRY," Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.",93
48530,GEORGE, What do you mean?,93
48531,JERRY," Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didn’t like the looks of the defense and changed the play.",93
48532,GEORGE, I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.,93
48533,JERRY, Uh huh.,93
48534,GEORGE, I mentioned how I liked horse manure.,93
48535,JERRY, You did?,93
48536,GEORGE, Yeah.,93
48537,JERRY, Yeah. You said you liked horse manure.,93
48538,GEORGE, Yeah.,93
48539,JERRY,  Mm-hm.,93
48540,GEORGE," You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a “nure,” with a “ma” in front of it. MA-NURE. I’z not bad.",93
48541,JERRY, And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?,93
48542,GEORGE," Yeah.  ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.",93
48543,JERRY, I’m just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.,93
48544,GEORGE, So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?,93
48545,JERRY," My honest opinion, I think she made it up.",93
48546,GEORGE," Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?",93
48547,KRAMER, Hey.,93
48548,JERRY," Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?",93
48549,KRAMER," Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.",93
48550,GEORGE, Well what do you eat?,93
48551,KRAMER," It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.",93
48552,JERRY, Well I’m glad it's working out.,93
48553,KRAMER," Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggie’s.",93
48554,JERRY," Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.",93
48555,KRAMER," Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, I’ll tell you, she's a full-figured gal.",93
48556,JERRY, Is she?,93
48557,KRAMER," Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.",93
48558,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.",93
48559,KRAMER, All right it's done.,93
48560,JERRY, Hello?,93
48561,BANIA," Hi, Jerry. It's Kenny.",93
48562,JERRY," Oh, Hi.",93
48563,BANIA," You know, I was thinking if you're not busy, maybe I can get my meal today?",93
48564,JERRY," Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?",93

48572,JERRY, Mm. That's fantastic. ,93
48573,BANIA, You work out with weights?,93
48574,JERRY, No I don't.,93
48575,BANIA, You should.,93
48576,JERRY, Why?,93
48577,BANIA, You worn the suit yet?,93
48578,JERRY," No, not yet.",93
48579,WAITER, have you decided?,93
48580,BANIA," Oh, get the swordfish. Best swordfish in the city. The best, Jerry.",93
48581,JERRY, I’ll have the salmon.,93
48582,WAITER, And you?,93
48583,BANIA," Ahh, you know what I think. I’m just going to have soup. Yeah, I’ll save the meal for another time.",93
48584,JERRY, Another time? What other time?,93
48585,BANIA, I had a hot dog earlier. I’m not that hungry.,93
48586,JERRY," No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.",93
48587,BANIA, Soup's not a meal. You're supposed to buy me a meal.,93
48588,JERRY, I’m not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.,93
48589,BANIA, But I don't want anything but soup.,93
48590,JERRY, Then that's the meal.,93
48591,BANIA, But I had the hot dog.,93
48592,JERRY, I didn’t tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?,93
48593,BANIA," Hey, I give you a brand-new Armani suit, and you won't even buy me a meal?",93
48594,JERRY," All right, fine. Get the soup!",93
48595,JERRY, So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.,93
48596,ELAINE, What kind of soup did he get?,93
48597,JERRY, I don't know? Consommé or something.,93
48598,ELAINE," Consommé, hmm.",93
48599,JERRY, What?,93
48600,ELAINE," Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.",93
48601,JERRY, Elaine you're missing the whole point.,93
48602,ELAINE, What?,93
48603,JERRY," The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.",93
48604,ELAINE, Was it a cup or a bowl?,93
48605,JERRY," You see -- ah, uh ...",93
48606,ELAINE, I’m just curious.,93
48607,JERRY," A bowl, ok?",93
48608,ELAINE, Did he crumble any crackers in it?,93
48609,ELAINE,"  Did he crumble, any crackers in it?",93
48610,JERRY," As a mater of fact, he did.",93
48611,ELAINE," Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.",93
48612,JERRY, It's like I’m talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.,93
48613,ELAINE," Oh, hi Simon. This is Jerry.",93
48614,SIMON," Hello.  Elaine, do you have any cash on you?",93
48615,ELAINE," Um, yeah in my purse.",93
48616,SIMON, No. There was only six dollars.,93
48617,JERRY," Well, I have some money. What do you need? ",93
48618,SIMON," Well, 20 should cover me.  Thanks mate. ",93
48619,ELAINE, Where you going?,93
48620,SIMON,  Just visiting.,93
48621,ELAINE," Oh, OK, see you later.",93
48622,SIMON, I won't be back for dinner. ,93
48623,ELAINE,  Pardon?,93
48624,JERRY, So is she working? Is she here?,93
48625,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah, she's here.",93
48626,JERRY, Have you said anything to her?,93
48627,GEORGE," No, but I’m very uncomfortable.",93
48628,JERRY, Are you going to say anything?,93
48629,GEORGE, There she is.  No no no no no no.,93
48630,KELLY, Hello,93
48631,GEORGE, Hello.,93
48632,KELLY," Well, what's it going to be?",93
48633,GEORGE, What's it gonna be?,93
48634,KELLY, Yes. What'll you have? Are you eating? It's in that vein.,93
48635,GEORGE," I’ll eh, I’ll just have a bowl of chili.",93
48636,JERRY, I’ll have an egg white omelet.,93
48637,GEORGE, What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?,93
48638,JERRY," Yeah, that was bad.",93
48639,GEORGE, Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter -  - there's no more banter.,93
48640,JERRY," Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. ",93
48641,BANIA, Hey.,93
48642,JERRY, Hey.,93
48643,BANIA, You worn the suit yet?,93
48644,JERRY," Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it.",93
48645,BANIA, You did?,93
48646,JERRY," ... Oh, I’m joking.",93
48647,BANIA, OH! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Can I squeeze in? ,93
48648,GEORGE, Sure you can.,93
48649,KELLY, Can I take your order?,93
48650,BANIA, What kind of soup do you have?,93
48651,JERRY, Why don't you get a sandwich?,93
48652,BANIA," Ok, I’ll have tomato soup and ah, tuna on toast.",93
48653,JERRY, OK ...  This is it ‘cha know,93
48654,JERRY, This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.,93
48655,BANIA, What are you talking about? this isn't a meal.,93
48656,JERRY, Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.,93
48657,BANIA," You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendy’s.",93
48658,JERRY, I tried to do that.,93
48659,BANIA, This is lunch in a coffee shop,93
48660,JERRY," Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.",93
48661,BANIA," Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture? ",93
48662,BANIA, I’m really not comfortable ...,93
48663,KRAMER,"  Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.",93
48664,GEORGE, Yeah.,93
48665,KRAMER, She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.,93

48670,JERRY, When's he leaving? ,93
48671,ELAINE," About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. ",93
48672,SIMON, Hey mate. Fancy a beer?,93
48673,JERRY," Ah, no thanks.",93
48674,JERRY,"  Hello? No, I’m sorry Bania ... I’m not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.",93
48675,JERRY," Hey, what size suit are you?",93
48676,SIMON, 40.,93
48677,JERRY," 40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?",93
48678,SIMON, Absolutely.,93
48679,JERRY," Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, here’s the car keys. ",93

48692,KRAMER, Really.,93
48693,JERRY," You want food, don't cha? ",93
48694,KRAMER," It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. ",93
48695,JERRY," All right, go ahead",93
48696,KRAMER, Thanks buddy. ,93
48697,HILDE, Did you find anything!,93
48698,KRAMER," Uh, yeah, ah ...",93

48702,HILDE," All right, it'll have to do. Come on.",93
48703,JERRY, What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?,93
48704,GEORGE, I can't go in there. I’m too uncomfortable.,93
48705,JERRY," Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?",93
48706,ELAINE," Hey, What are you doing out here?",93
48707,JERRY," We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.",93
48708,GEORGE, What's the difference? Let's go to Reggie’s.,93
48709,ELAINE, Reggie’s? I can't eat anything there.,93
48710,GEORGE, It's the same menu.,93
48711,ELAINE, There's no “Big Salad.”,93
48712,GEORGE," They'll make you a “Big Salad.” What do you think, they're the only one's that make a “Big Salad”?",93
48713,ELAINE," All right. Let's go, to Reggie’s.",93
48714,JERRY, So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?,93
48715,ELAINE, Ahh ... wait till you hear this.,93
48716,ELAINE," So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.",93
48717,JERRY," Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, “No egg white omelets.” Look at that.",93
48718,GEORGE, So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.,93
48719,HILDE,  Hello.,93
48720,JERRY," Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?",93

48728,HILDE, I can bring you 2 small salads.,93
48729,ELAINE, Could you put it in a big bowl?,93
48730,HILDE, We don't have big bowls.,93
48731,ELAINE, All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.,93
48732,HILDE, We have Sanka.,93
48733,GEORGE," I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.",93
48734,JERRY, Not fair.,93
48735,GEORGE," If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!",93
48736,JERRY, She's on your turf.,93
48737,GEORGE, If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.,93
48738,JERRY, You're the best.,93
48739,GEORGE, Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?,93
48740,JERRY," Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.",93
48741,KRAMER, H-Hey. She's hungry Jerry.,93
48742,JERRY," Well, there's nothing left. There's no food.",93
48743,KRAMER, No food? Well you gotta have something --  -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.,93
48744,HILDE,  Food!,93
48745,KRAMER," There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.",93
48746,JERRY, Why'd she get fired?,93
48747,KRAMER," Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didn’t like it.",93
48748,ELAINE," So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.",93
48749,JERRY," Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?",93
48750,ELAINE, Yes. He's one of those bounders.,93
48751,KELLY, Egg white omelet and Big Salad.,93
48752,ELAINE, AHhh. Thank you.,93
48753,KELLY," I just wanted you guys know that Friday's my last day. Bloomingdales ordered a bunch of my clips, thank God, I don't have to do this any more. ",93
48754,ELAINE, Ah ,93
48755,BANIA," Hey Jerry, where's my suit?",93
48756,JERRY, I don't have it. You want half my omelet? ,93
48757,KELLY," Oh he's not my boyfriend. It's that bald guy with the glasses, who's always here with them. He's trying to get me in trouble.",93
48758,SIMON," Well, hello. Here you are as promised. You see, I’m a man of my word. ",93
48759,ELAINE, When are you leaving?,93
48760,SIMON," Elaine, are you trying to get rid of me? Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I was supposed to leave tomorrow, but all of a sudden, I've been set up with a job interview that might enable me to extend my visit indefinitely. And it is all due, to this suit. How do I look? I’m a shoe-in aren't I. Thanks again love. ",93
48761,ELAINE,  Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?,93
48762,BANIA,  Yeah!,93
48763,ELAINE, There it goes. ,93
48764,BANIA, Hey! Hey!  Come Here You!,93
48765,SIMON,  What are you doing? Unhand me!,93
48766,BANIA,  Take It Off!,93
48767,CAR SALESMAN," George, are you sure I can't show you any other cars?",94
48768,GEORGE," I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.",94
48769,SALESMAN, I got a LeBaron convertible right here.,94
48770,GEORGE , N.I. Not interested.,94
48771,SALESMAN," It's got a few more miles on it, but the previous owner was John Voight.",94
48772,GEORGE , Jon Voight?,94
48773,JERRY," Okay, Tim. You're welcome. ",94
48774,ELAINE, Was that Tim Whatley?,94
48775,JERRY," Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party.  You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?",94
48776,ELAINE, I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? ,94
48777,JERRY," Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.",94
48778,ELAINE, Why?,94
48779,JERRY," He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy.  Away from the gums... ",94
48780,JERRY, Uh - new car!,94
48781,ELAINE, Ohhh!,94
48782,JERRY, Hey! Did you get the Volvo?,94
48783,GEORGE," No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.",94
48784,ELAINE, A LeBaron?,94
48785,JERRY, I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.,94
48786,GEORGE, What Consumer? I'm the consumer.,94
48787,JERRY, Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.,94
48788,GEORGE," Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.",94
48789,ELAINE, Jon Voight? The actor?,94
48790,GEORGE , That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.,94
48791,JERRY, You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?,94
48792,GEORGE ," No, no...",94
48793,JERRY," I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.",94
48794,GEORGE," Alright, maybe I do. So what.",94
48795,ELAINE," I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. ",94
48796,KRAMER, Hey.,94
48797,JERRY, Hey.,94
48798,KRAMER," Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.",94
48799,ELAINE, I like coffee.,94
48800,GEORGE," I like  ""cookies.""",94
48801,KRAMER," Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.",94
48802,GEORGE," Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.",94
48803,KRAMER," Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'",94
48804,JERRY, I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.,94
48805,KRAMER," Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.",94
48806,JERRY," Alright, take 'em.",94
48807,KRAMER , Yeah-yah.,94
48808,POP," Kramer, without you, we'd be out of business.",94
48809,KRAMER," Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.",94
48810,MOM, So many sneakers!,94
48811,KRAMER," Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.",94
48812,POP, They'll be ready a week from Thursday.,94
48813,KRAMER," Oh, well, no rush.  Uh oh.",94
48814,MOM, What's the matter?,94
48815,KRAMER," Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds.",94
48816,MOM," Oh, lie down, and put your head back.",94
48817,KRAMER," Yeah.  Hey, what's with your ceiling? ",94
48818,POP, What?,94
48819,KRAMER ," Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.",94
48820,POP," You know, in the 48 years we've been here, I don't think we've ever called an electrician.",94
48821,KRAMER," Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.",94
48822,MR. PITT, Elaine?,94
48823,ELAINE," Yes, Mr. Pitt?",94
48824,MR. PITT, Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?,94
48825,ELAINE," No, I'm still working on it.",94
48826,MR. PITT, What in blazes are you listening to?,94
48827,ELAINE," Artie Shaw. ""Honeysuckle Jump."" ",94
48828,DJ ON RADIO," That was Artie Shaw, ""Honeysuckle Jump.""",94
48829,MR. PITT, Elaine! How did you know that?,94
48830,ELAINE," Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.",94
48831,DJ ON RADIO," Congratulations to our listener Wayne Hopper for identifying it. And by doing so, he becomes our seventh person to land the WFBB-sponsored Woody Woodpecker balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.  There are only three spots left. We're going to take a little break now; when we come back, you'll have three more chances to win a spot holding a rope under Woody Woodpecker.",94
48832,MR. PITT , Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you?,94
48833,ELAINE," Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?",94
48834,MR. PITT, My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list.,94
48835,ELAINE," Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. ",94
48836,DJ ON RADIO," Alright, here we go for the next spot under the balloon. If you know the name of this song, call 555-BAND. ",94
48837,MR. PITT ," Well, Elaine? Do you know it? What song is it?",94
48838,ELAINE, Will you shut up? I can't hear!,94
48839,MR. PITT, I'm sorry!,94
48840,ELAINE," Oh! I've got it! It's ""Next Stop Pottersville""! ",94
48841,MR. PITT ," Goody! Yes! Yes! Yes!  Next Stop Pottersville, Next Stop Pottersville! You are a genius!",94
48842,GEORGE, You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.,94
48843,JERRY," I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.",94
48844,GEORGE," What do you mean ""might""? You don't think he really owned this car?",94
48845,JERRY, I don't know.,94
48846,GEORGE," Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?",94
48847,JERRY," Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.",94
48848,GEORGE," Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. ",94
48849,JERRY," Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.",94
48850,GEORGE," Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.",94
48851,JERRY ," Alright, I'll change my shoes. ",94
48852,GEORGE ," Liam Neeson. You know, he's not American.",94
48853,JERRY, Let me get a clean pair. ,94
48854,GEORGE , Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...,94
48855,JERRY , Kramer!  Hey! Where's all my sneakers?,94
48856,KRAMER, You said take 'em.,94
48857,JERRY, Not all of 'em!,94
48858,KRAMER," Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.",94
48859,JERRY, Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?,94
48860,KRAMER," Jerry, I left you a pair right here... C'mon. There, put on those boots.",94
48861,JERRY, I can't wear these!,94
48862,KRAMER," Well, why not?",94
48863,JERRY, They're uncomfortable.,94
48864,KRAMER," C'mon here, try 'em on. ",94
48865,GEORGE, Where did you get those?,94
48866,JERRY," I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these!  They look ridiculous!",94
48867,KRAMER," Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?",94
48868,JERRY, But I don't wanna be a cowboy!,94
48869,KRAMER," Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.",94
48870,GEORGE," Yeah, I got one too.",94
48871,KRAMER, Yeah?,94
48872,JERRY, Oh yeah? Huh.,94
48873,GEORGE, What?,94
48874,JERRY," No, nothing.",94
48875,GEORGE," No, what is it?",94
48876,JERRY," No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.",94
48877,GEORGE, You didn't get one?,94
48878,JERRY," Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.",94
48879,KRAMER, Not necessarily.,94
48880,JERRY," Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?",94
48881,GEORGE , That's the genius of it.,94
48882,JERRY , I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.,94
48883,GEORGE , Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. ,94
48884,KRAMER , Boss!,94
48885,POP, Four thousand dollars? We can't afford that!,94
48886,ELECTRICIAN," Well I'm afraid you're gonna have to do something about it, because it's in violation of the building code. Otherwise, they're gonna close you up.",94
48887,POP, But what if we can't pay for it?,94
48888,ELECTRICIAN," Then I have to report you. Otherwise, I lose my license. Sorry. ",94
48889,POP," 48 years, Mom! And now we have to close! All because of that idiot and his bloody nose! ",94
48890,KRAMER," Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.",94
48891,GEORGE, So?,94
48892,JERRY," C'mon, put the top up, it's November!",94
48893,GEORGE," I feel alive, Jerry.",94
48894,JERRY, Let's check out the glove box.  Ah. Pencil.,94
48895,GEORGE," Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!",94
48896,JERRY, With Jon Voight's teeth marks.  Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.,94
48897,GEORGE, Ah! See? I told ya.,94
48898,JERRY, Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.,94
48899,GEORGE, So?,94
48900,JERRY, Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?,94
48901,GEORGE ," So, what are you saying?",94
48902,JERRY," Nothing. I'm sure ""Jon"" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! ",94
48903,GEORGE , Get out of the car!,94
48904,JERRY, What?,94
48905,GEORGE," That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!",94
48906,JERRY ," Oh, look! There's Gregory Peck's bicycle!",94
48907,GEORGE, Get out!,94
48908,JERRY, And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!,94
48909,GEORGE, Get out!! ,94
48910,TOUGH GUY ," Hey, cowboy. Where's your horse?  Yeah, you better run!",94
48911,GEORGE, Did they take anything?,94
48912,JERRY," No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.",94
48913,GEORGE," Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.",94
48914,JERRY, You really seemed to enjoy it.,94
48915,GEORGE," It was kinda fun.  You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.",94
48916,JERRY ," Yeah, that's possible.",94
48917,GEORGE," How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.",94
48918,JERRY , He'll dispose of it.,94
48919,GEORGE," Heh, that's right. See ya later. ",94
48920,ELAINE," So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.",94
48921,JERRY," Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?",94
48922,ELAINE," Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...",94
48923,JERRY, Yeah...,94
48924,ELAINE," And I asked him, ""Should Jerry bring anything?""",94
48925,JERRY, So...?,94
48926,ELAINE," Mmmm...and he said, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?""",94
48927,JERRY," Alright, but let me ask you this question.",94
48928,ELAINE, What?,94
48929,JERRY," Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?"" or, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?"" You emphasize ""Jerry"" or ""bring.""",94
48930,ELAINE," I think he emphasized ""would.""",94
48931,JERRY," You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. ",94
48932,KRAMER, Hey.,94
48933,JERRY," Hey, so where's my sneakers?",94
48934,KRAMER, That's what I wanna know.,94
48935,JERRY, What do you mean?,94
48936,KRAMER," Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.",94
48937,JERRY, So all my sneakers are gone?,94
48938,KRAMER, I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.,94
48939,JERRY, Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!,94
48940,KRAMER," It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.",94
48941,ELAINE ," So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.",94
48942,KRAMER, Apparently.,94
48943,ELAINE," Alright, that's enough of this.",94
48944,JERRY, Where ya goin'?,94
48945,ELAINE, I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.,94
48946,JERRY, Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?,94
48947,ELAINE," He finds his laugh ""intoxicating."" ",94
48948,MR. MORGAN," So George, what kind of promotional events are we talking about?",94
48949,GEORGE," Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.",94
48950,MR. MORGAN," Jon Voight? The actor?  Uh, I make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been initiated by George Costanza.",94
48951,GEORGE," I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.",94
48952,CONTEST WINNER ," I guessed Stan Herman's ""Boomtown Blues."" What'd you guess?",94
48953,ELAINE," Um, it was, uh...""Next Stop Pottersville.""  Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?",94
48954,CONTEST WINNER, After the music. ,94
48955,KRAMER, Oh. Oh man. ,94
48956,VOIGHT, Taxi!  Taxi.,94
48957,KRAMER," Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight!  Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...",94
48958,JERRY," No Jon Voight Day, huh?",94
48959,GEORGE," No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?",94
48960,JERRY," Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.",94
48961,GEORGE, You should have somebody take a look at that.,94
48962,JERRY," I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.",94
48963,GEORGE, You going to the party?,94
48964,JERRY," No, I don't know if I'm invited.",94
48965,GEORGE," Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.",94
48966,JERRY," Yeah, you're right.",94
48967,GEORGE, You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.,94
48968,JERRY," Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.",94
48969,GEORGE, Maybe I'll just meet you there.,94
48970,JERRY, You don't want to go with me?,94
48971,GEORGE," Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?",94
48972,JERRY," The way I feel when I go places with you?  Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?",94
48973,KRAMER," No.  But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?",94
48974,GEORGE, Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?,94
48975,KRAMER," Well, he was a little standoffish.",94
48976,GEORGE," What, you didn't ask him about the car?",94
48977,KRAMER," No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me.  Look.",94
48978,JERRY, What?,94
48979,KRAMER, His tooth marks. He bit me.,94
48980,GEORGE, Jon Voight bit you?,94
48981,JERRY," Well, what is he, a vampire?",94
48982,KRAMER," No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.",94
48983,GEORGE , He left perfect imprints.,94
48984,KRAMER," That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!",94
48985,JERRY," Oh, please.",94
48986,GEORGE," Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.",94
48987,JERRY," No, it's stupid.",94
48988,GEORGE," Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.",94
48989,JERRY, So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.,94
48990,GEORGE, It's worth a shot. ,94
48991,JERRY," So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?",94
48992,KRAMER," Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.",94
48993,JERRY ," Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist?  Dentist? Are you a dentist?",94
48994,GEORGE," These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.",94
48995,KRAMER, You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?,94
48996,GEORGE," Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?",94
48997,KRAMER, That's right. He's a troublemaker.,94
48998,JERRY," Hey, Elaine. Did you get my message?",94
48999,ELAINE, What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?,94
49000,JERRY ," What is that, the Empire State Building?",94
49001,ELAINE, What? I can't hear you.,94
49002,JERRY," Elaine, would you marry me?",94
49003,ELAINE," I told you, I can't hear a word.",94
49004,JERRY, Alright. Forget it.,94
49005,GEORGE," Hey, Tim.",94
49006,TIM," Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.' ",94
49007,GEORGE," Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.",94
49008,TIM," No, it's no problem, what is it?",94
49009,GEORGE," Let me show you something, take a look at this... ",94
49010,GUY," Alright Tim, I'm gonna get goin.'",94
49011,TIM," Alright, let me take down your number.  Is that Jerry Seinfeld?",94
49012,KRAMER, He didn't come with us. ,94
49013,GEORGE," Uh, Tim, the pencil...",94
49014,TIM, Jerry.,94
49015,JERRY," Hey, Tim.",94
49016,TIM, Jerry. I didn't think you'd show.,94
49017,JERRY," Did you say, ""Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"" or, ""Jerry, I didn't think you'd show""? ",94
49018,TIM, Elaine! Hi!,94
49019,ELAINE, Tim.,94
49020,TIM, Well. I'm really glad you came.,94
49021,ELAINE, What?,94
49022,TIM, Really glad you came.,94
49023,ELAINE , Uh huh.,94
49024,TIM ," Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve?  Thanks.",94
49025,ELAINE , What? What?,94
49026,GEORGE, Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?,94
49027,DENTIST, It's possible.,94
49028,GEORGE , Roll up your sleeve.,94
49029,DENTIST, Somebody bit you?,94
49030,KRAMER, Not just someone. Jon Voight.,94
49031,DENTIST," Jon Voight bit you?  The pencil! Hey, hey! Get the pencil out of your mouth, you're destroying Jon Voight's teeth marks!",94
49032,TIM, That's John Voight's pencil?,94
49033,GEORGE, That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.,94
49034,TIM, Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible?,94
49035,GEORGE ," Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!",94
49036,TIM," Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.",94
49037,GEORGE," Jon Voight, the actor?",94
49038,TIM, No. The periodontist. ,94
49039,DENTIST, Can't this wait until Monday? Come by my office.,94
49040,JERRY, Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.,94
49041,DENTIST, Alright. Sit down.,94
49042,JERRY , It's this one here in the back. ,94
49043,KRAMER, Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker!,94
49044,TIM ," Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker! ",94
49045,ANNOUNCER ON TV," Hey, it looks like Woody Woodpecker is running out of air. In fact, he's collapsing.",94
49046,KRAMER, Those kids look pretty disappointed.,94
49047,JERRY, Especially that big kid up in the front.  How old is he?  Hello?,94
49048,GUY ON PHONE," Hello, is this Jerry Seinfeld?",94
49049,JERRY, Yes it is.,94
49050,GUY ON PHONE," You don't know me, but a really strange thing happened. I was at a garage sale, and this old couple sold me a used pair of sneakers they claimed belonged to Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian.",94
49051,JERRY," Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much.  I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!",94
49052,KRAMER, Where are they?,94
49053,JERRY," Parsippany, New Jersey.",94
49054,KRAMER, Let's go!,94
49055,JERRY, My car's in the shop.,94
49056,KRAMER," Well, how are we getting to Parsippany?",94
49057,KRAMER, Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again.,94
49058,JERRY , Maybe we should get you to a hospital.,94
49059,KRAMER ," Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here.",94
49060,GEORGE, Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.,95
49061,JERRY, That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.,95
49062,GEORGE," Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.",95
49063,JERRY, From your mother.,95
49064,JERRY," So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the “Spokes model” category?",95
49065,GEORGE," Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. I’ll never get any work done. So I’m doing a complete 360. I’m going for total efficiency and ability.",95
49066,JERRY," That's a 180, George.",95
49067,GEORGE, Whatever.,95
49068,JERRY, Hi Willie.,95
49069,WILLIE, Hey Jerry. ,95
49070,JERRY, I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.,95
49071,WILLIE, What are you doing with it?,95
49072,JERRY," Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.",95
49073,DONNA, Hi.,95
49074,JERRY, Hi.,95
49075,WILLIE," Hey Jerry, you know my wife “Donna”.",95
49076,JERRY," Yeah, that's why I said “hi”.",95
49077,WILLIE," Hey, nice jacket. ",95
49078,JERRY, Thanks. It's Hounds-Tooth.,95
49079,WILLIE," Whoa, this is a beauty. Great cut. It's probably very flattering.",95
49080,JERRY," Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.",95
49081,APPLICANT," Well, I type about 90 words a minute. I’m completely well-versed in all IBM and Macintosh programs.",95
49082,GEORGE,"  Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. I’m looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, I’m afraid this is not going to work out  Thanks for coming in.",95
49083,GEORGE, You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. I’m terribly sorry. ,95
49084,ADE," As you can see my references are impeccable. I think I’d be a real asset here. My only concern is, I do take care of my mother. So will there be any late nights?",95
49085,GEORGE, I can't imagine.,95
49086,ELAINE," Ok, So Barney’s is having this huge sale. I try this dress on --  -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.",95
49087,JERRY, Yeah.,95
49088,ELAINE," OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like I’m carrying twins.",95
49089,JERRY," So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.",95
49090,ELAINE, Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.,95
49091,JERRY, I thought we were going to the movies?,95
49092,ELAINE, All right I’ll try it on again. You tell me what you think. ,95
49093,GEORGE, Hey hey.,95
49094,ELAINE, Hey George,95
49095,GEORGE," Hey Elaine.  I’m telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible.  I don't know why I didn’t have one before.",95
49096,JERRY, Because you didn’t have a job?,95
49097,GEORGE," Perhaps.  I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.",95
49098,JERRY, A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the “dish” and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.,95
49099,JERRY, It's a little ...,95
49100,ELAINE, All Right!  You answered it right there.,95
49101,JERRY, You got no waist in that thing.,95
49102,GEORGE, You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.,95
49103,ELAINE," I said, All Right.",95
49104,GEORGE, Well wha’d you buy it for?,95
49105,ELAINE," Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barney’s, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi  Moore in Indecent Proposal.",95
49106,JERRY, How fast was she walking?,95
49107,GEORGE, Demi ? I thought it was Demi?,95
49108,JERRY, No. I think it's Demi. ,95
49109,GEORGE, Really? I never heard of a semi  tractor-trailer. ,95
49110,ELAINE, Wait a minute  Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! ,95
49111,JERRY, What?,95
49112,ELAINE," Skinny Mirrors! Barney’s has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.",95
49113,JERRY," Oh, you're crazy.",95
49114,ELAINE, Am I?  Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barney’s?,95
49115,GEORGE,  You know I think she might have something there.,95
49116,KRAMER, Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?,95
49117,ELAINE, Oh I’m returning this dress to Barney’s.,95
49118,KRAMER, Good idea.,95
49119,JERRY, Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.,95
49120,ELAINE," Yeah yeah, ok.",95
49121,KRAMER," Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.",95
49122,ELAINE, Moisturizer? That's girls stuff.,95
49123,KRAMER," No no, look. I’ll tell you what -- they're having a sale right.",95
49124,ELAINE, yeah.,95
49125,KRAMER," I’ll meetcha down there, well have lunch.",95
49126,ELAINE, Well we could ...,95
49127,KRAMER," Well, we’ll get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... ",95
49128,GEORGE," And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So let’s clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.",95
49129,ADE, Anaheim Hotel.  You may want to reconsider. I believe they only have room service until 10 P.M. and then it's only finger foods.,95
49130,GEORGE," Ade, you're a wonder. ",95
49131,ADE," OK, now I projected some of those figures for you regarding the switch to Canola oil for the stadium popcorn and surprisingly it will only come to 1/2 a cent more per bag, so it is definitely doable.",95
49132,GEORGE," Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.",95
49133,ADE," Well thank you, I’m flattered.",95
49134,GEORGE," I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.",95
49135,ADE," Well I’m just, hm, doing my job.",95
49136,GEORGE," It's like I’m thinking of something, and you're  one step ahead of me.",95
49137,ADE, What can I say? I’m ... I’m good at what I do. ,95
49138,GEORGE,"  Do you, uh ... do you know what I’m ... thinking about now?",95
49139,ADE,"  Yes, I think I do. ",95
49140,GEORGE," Is it, uh, doable?",95
49141,ADE, It's definitely doable.,95
49142,JERRY," Well, that was the worst.",95
49143,ELAINE, I can’t believe they made the Wife the killer.  Gimme a break.,95
49144,MAN,"  Hey, give us a break. We haven't seen it yet. Thanks a lot big mouth!",95
49145,KRAMER, You got a pen?,95
49146,JERRY," Yeah, I think I do.",95
49147,KRAMER, And I need something to write on.,95
49148,JERRY," Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.",95
49149,KRAMER," I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.",95
49150,JERRY, Uma Therman? Really?,95
49151,KRAMER, Yeah.,95
49152,ELAINE, How'd you manage that.,95
49153,KRAMER, Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. ,95
49154,JERRY," He's got the Kavorca.  Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?",95
49155,ELAINE, Where?,95
49156,JERRY," He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.",95
49157,ELAINE, What would he be doing wearing your jacket?,95
49158,JERRY, It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.,95
49159,ELAINE, Are you sure?,95
49160,KRAMER," I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. ",95
49161,ELAINE, You are amazing.,95
49162,KRAMER," Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. ",95
49163,ADE," Ah no no no no no. A better way to reach the bra would be to undo the jacket, then go around the back of the shirt.",95
49164,GEORGE, Ade you are incredible,95
49165,ADE," Oh ...oh ...oh ... Here, I want to show you something. Hand me that pillow.",95
49166,GEORGE," What? Oh, My God!",95
49167,ADE, Mr. CO STAN ZA!,95
49168,GEORGE," Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... I’m giving you a raise!",95
49169,JERRY," So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out “I’m giving you a raise.”",95
49170,GEORGE, Yeah.,95
49171,JERRY, Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?,95
49172,GEORGE," Not that I’m aware of, no.",95
49173,JERRY," So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.",95
49174,GEORGE, I didn’t think ahead.,95
49175,JERRY, Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.,95
49176,GEORGE, I didn’t say any other bawdy things.,95
49177,JERRY, Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.,95
49178,GEORGE," All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.",95
49179,JERRY," All right, all right. I’m sorry.",95
49180,GEORGE," Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenner’s office and tell him he has to give her a raise.",95
49181,JERRY, How long has she been there?,95
49182,GEORGE, 3 days.,95
49183,JERRY, It's almost a week.,95
49184,JERRY," Oh, My god.",95
49185,GEORGE, What?,95
49186,JERRY, It's a movie stub from the 9,95
49187,ELAINE," These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.",95
49188,ELAINE, OK fine.  I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... ,95
49189,ELAINE, Ok thanks so much.  What are you all dressed up for?,95
49190,KRAMER," Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.",95
49191,ELAINE, I like your little bag.,95
49192,KRAMER," Huh, oh hey, look at this.  It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.",95
49193,ELAINE, Huh.,95
49194,KRAMER, Wait till that Uma smells this Uva.,95
49195,BANIA, Hey Kramer.,95
49196,KRAMER," Hey Bania, what's happening? ",95
49197,BANIA, I’m looking for a new suit. I can’t find anything I like. That's a nice suit. ,95
49198,KRAMER," Well, thank you.",95
49199,BANIA, Did you get that here?,95
49200,KRAMER," No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.",95
49201,BANIA, You're telling me.,95
49202,KRAMER, I sure am.,95
49203,BANIA, It's hard for me to find pants that --,95
49204,KRAMER,  That don't make you look high-waisted.,95
49205,BANIA, Yes,95
49206,KRAMER, Me too.,95
49207,BANIA, What size are you?,95
49208,KRAMER," Uh, 42.",95
49209,BANIA," 42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, I’m huge. How'd you like to sell it?",95
49210,KRAMER, make me an offer.,95
49211,BANIA, 100 Bucks,95
49212,KRAMER, Surely you jest. ,95
49213,BANIA, 175,95
49214,KRAMER, Look at the stitching  This is old world craftsmanship.,95
49215,BANIA, 300 dollars.,95
49216,KRAMER, Sold. Follow me into the dressing room.,95
49217,BANIA, You throw the shirt in?,95
49218,KRAMER," Bania, you're killing me.",95
49219,BANIA, Hey that's the women's dressing room.,95
49220,KRAMER, There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.,95
49221,GEORGE,"  Mr. Steinbrenner,  can I talk to you for a second?",95
49222,STEINBRENNER, Yes yes George. Can you talk to me for a second? Of course you can -- I’m a very accessible man. I just wanted to say you're doing great work on that Canola oil stuff.,95
49223,GEORGE," Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.",95
49224,STEINBRENNER," Ade, Ade, I like that name George.",95
49225,GEORGE, She supports her whole family. ,95
49226,STEINBRENNER, Is that a fact George?,95
49227,GEORGE," Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. ",95
49228,STEINBRENNER, I had a bout of that myself one time -- knocked me right on my ass.,95
49229,GEORGE, She can’t even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.,95
49230,STEINBRENNER," What's that cost her, like, two and a quarter? ",95
49231,GEORGE, You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.,95
49232,STEINBRENNER," You know, she'd be better off making a sandwich at home and bringing it in.  Hello, ah, George will you excuse me.",95
49233,KRAMER, Psst. Hey.,95
49234,ELAINE," Kramer, what are you doing here?",95
49235,KRAMER," Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.",95
49236,ELAINE, What?,95
49237,KRAMER," Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.",95
49238,ELAINE, So go buy a new one.,95
49239,KRAMER," What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.",95
49240,ELAINE, So.,95
49241,KRAMER," Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.",95
49242,ELAINE, Ouhhh ,95

49247,JERRY, Yeah. Specifically 9,95
49248,WILLIE, What are you gettin at?,95
49249,JERRY, I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.,95
49250,WILLIE, Jerry that's a breach of the dry-cleaner’s code.,95
49251,JERRY, You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples’ clothes,95
49252,WILLIE, I wasn't wearing your jacket. Jerry you're imagining things. ,95
49253,JERRY," Yeahhh, am I imagining this?  Found this little cutie in the pocket. ",95
49254,WILLIE, Jerry.,95
49255,JERRY," Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- I’ll be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.",95
49256,WILLIE," Jerry, come on.",95

49261,JERRY," Where's that ticket? Oh, Kramer.",95

49263,JERRY," No, not on me.",95
49264,WILLIE," Well, I, I need to see that ticket.",95
49265,JERRY, Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.,95
49266,WILLIE," Yeah, but this is different. Those fur storage warehouses are huge. You can’t, get anything without a number.",95
49267,JERRY," All right, I’ll be back.",95
49268,ELAINE," Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?",95
49269,ELAINE," I don't know, I have to think about it.  I need a nonpartisan mirror.",95
49270,ADE," I can’t thank you enough, Mr. Costanza. I’m so grateful",95
49271,GEORGE," Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didn’t get it, that I, was leaving. ",95
49272,ADE, It was just so generous.,95
49273,GEORGE," Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. ",95
49274,ADE," Oh I know, but Twenty Five Thousand.",95
49275,GEORGE,"  So you got a $25,000 a year raise.",95
49276,ADE," Yes, I tell you, Mr. Steinbrenner...",95
49277,GEORGE, You're making more than I am.,95
49278,ADE, I am?,95
49279,GEORGE, What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.,95
49280,ADE, Well apparently they can.,95
49281,ELAINE," Oh, this is insanity. I’m not this hippie. ",95
49282,ELAINE," Hey, what do you think of this?",95
49283,MAN, You'll never pull it off.,95
49284,FEMALE CUSTOMER," Hey, what's going on in there?",95
49285,JERRY,"  Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?",95
49286,FEMALE CUSTOMER, This woman has been in there for over an hour.,95
49287,KRAMER, [Yeah] ,95
49288,JERRY, Kramer?,95
49289,KRAMER," Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes?",95

49291,KRAMER, Didn’t Elaine call you?,95
49292,JERRY, No.,95
49293,KRAMER, Well what are you doing here?,95
49294,JERRY, What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.,95
49295,KRAMER," Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants",95
49296,JERRY, Where are your pants?,95
49297,KRAMER," Well, I sold them to Bania.",95
49298,JERRY, What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.,95
49299,JERRY, Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?,95
49300,KRAMER, ouhhh -- I had Uma Therman’s number written on that stub. I lost Uma’s number.,95
49301,JERRY, Where are your clothes?,95
49302,KRAMER, I told you I sold them to Bania.,95
49303,JERRY, You mean what you were wearing?,95
49304,KRAMER, Yeah.,95
49305,JERRY, How'd you expect to get out of here?,95
49306,KRAMER," Well, I didn’t think ahead.",95
49307,ELAINE, This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.,95
49308,ELAINE, No?,95
49309,ELAINE, I am?,95
49310,ELAINE, Ha! That's preposterous.,95
49311,ELAINE," No. You can wrap it.  Kramer, are you still in there?",95
49312,JERRY, [Elaine],95
49313,ELAINE, Jerry?,95
49314,BANIA," Elaine, where's Kramer?",95
49315,KRAMER, Bania?,95
49316,BANIA, Kramer.,95
49317,JERRY, I’m going out. ,95
49318,BANIA, Jerry.,95
49319,JERRY, Bania.,95
49320,BANIA," Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. You're nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined.",95
49321,KRAMER," Well you're not getting any money back.  Jerry, come back in here.",95
49322,JERRY,  Excuse me. ,95
49323,KRAMER, Uma’s number is on that ticket.,95
49324,JERRY," Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?",95
49325,KRAMER, I’m not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.,95
49326,JERRY, I got an idea.,95
49327,KRAMER, What?,95
49328,JERRY, I can’t believe I’m gonna do this. ,95
49329,JERRY, Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?,95
49330,BANIA, Pretty good.,95
49331,JERRY," Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, I’m in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.",95
49332,BANIA," Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket.",95
49333,JERRY," Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.",95
49334,BANIA, Can we go back to Mendy’s?,95
49335,JERRY," You want to go to Mendy’s, I’ll take you to Mendy’s.",95
49336,BANIA, Twice? I wanna go twice.,95
49337,JERRY," all right let’s be reasonable, Bania. I’m taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.",95
49338,BANIA, Two Mendy’s.,95
49339,JERRY, . . . All right  Just give me the ticket.,95
49340,BANIA, Here you go.,95
49341,JERRY, Ohh ... ,95
49342,GEORGE," But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.",95
49343,STEINBRENNER," Uh huh, I understand what you're saying George and I know what it's like to be financially strapped. When I was a young man in Cleveland I use to hitchhike to work. One time I got picked up by a bakery truck. You think that stuff smells good? Try being cooped up in the back of one of those babies.",95
49344,STEINBRENNER, I couldn't look at a donut for the next two years. Well not that I was ever one for the sweets.,95
49345,STEINBRENNER," Sure I like a cup cake every now and then, like everybody else. You know I like it when they have a little cream on the inside, it's a surprise. That's good, plus the chocolate ones are good too. Sometimes I just can’t even make up my mind. A lot of times I’ll mix the two together, make a vanilla fudge.",95
49346,JERRY," Let me in, it's me.  Here. You don't know what this is costing me. ",95
49347,KRAMER,"  All right, nice work.  Where's Uma’s number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.",95
49348,JERRY,  The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.,95
49349,KRAMER,  It must have been the botanical extracts.,95
49350,JERRY,  Give me that.,95
49351,JERRY," Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. ",95
49352,BANIA,  You trying to get out of Mendy’s? you can’t do that.,95
49353,JERRY, The ticket is worthless.,95
49354,BANIA, You promised me.,95
49355,JERRY," Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat?",95
49356,DONNA, No it's not. ,95
49357,JERRY, It is!  Give me that back.,95
49358,DONNA," No, what are you talking about.",95
49359,DONNA, Are you out of your mind? Don't you ... take your hands ...,95
49360,JERRY," You can’t have that coat, it's not yours.",95
49361,JERRY, What do you think the dry-cleaner’s is your own personal closet!,95
49362,ELAINE," Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?													",95
49363,DONNA, Let me see.  Piece of cake. Bring it													in.  What size is it?,95
49364,ELAINE, ,95
49365,BANIA, Mmm. This soup is great.,95
49366,JERRY," Yeah, it's very good. ",95
49367,BANIA," I told you Mendy’s had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it?",95
49368,JERRY, Yeah. I’m having a wonderful time. ,95
49369,BANIA," Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand --",95
49370,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.",95
49371,BANIA," Yeah. Well, let’s hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. I’m meeting a woman for a drink.",95
49372,JERRY," Oh, and who might that be?",95
49373,BANIA, Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking. ,95
49374,JERRY," If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, I’m telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. I’m sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.",95
49375,JERRY,"The Christmas tree certainly seems to inspire a love/hate relationship. All that time is spent selecting it and decorating it, and then a week after it's just thrown somewhere, you see it by the side of the road, it looks like a mob hit. A car slows down, a door opens and this tree just rolls out. People snap out of that Christmas spirit like it was a drunken stupor, they just wake up one morning and go, ""Oh my god, there's a tree inside the house! Just throw it anywhere!",96
49376,JERRY, Ready to go Lois?,96
49377,LOIS, You really like to say my name? Don't you?,96
49378,JERRY, Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.,96
49379,LOIS," Oh, Mr. Meyers this is my friend, Jerry.",96
49380,DUNCAN, Jerry Seinfeld!,96
49381,JERRY, Duncan Meyers!,96
49382,LOIS, You two know each other?,96
49383,DUNCAN," Yeah! We uh, went to High School together. Didn't we Jerry? Gee I hope you're not leaving now. We still have a lot of work left to do.",96
49384,LOIS, Would you be able to come all the way downtown again in rush hour to pick me up?,96
49385,JERRY," Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.",96
49386,ELAINE," No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?",96
49387,LEW, You no order Chicken Cashew.,96
49388,ELAINE, I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.,96
49389,LEW, Fine Benes. We are putting you on our list.,96
49390,ELAINE, What list?,96
49391,LEW," The ""do not deliver"" list.",96
49392,ELAINE," MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.",96
49393,GEORGE, Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?,96
49394,ELAINE, Ned must have left it here.,96
49395,GEORGE, Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?,96
49396,ELAINE," HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.",96
49397,GEORGE," Maybe he's just ""very well RED""?",96
49398,ELAINE, Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?,96
49399,GEORGE," Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?",96
49400,ELAINE," Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.",96
49401,GEORGE," Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. ""Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important."" . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.",96
49402,JERRY, Hi oh.,96
49403,ELAINE, Where's Lois?,96
49404,JERRY, She couldn't make it.,96
49405,GEORGE, I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.,96
49406,JERRY," I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.",96
49407,GEORGE, Duncan Meyers?,96
49408,ELAINE, Who's he?,96
49409,JERRY," Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.",96
49410,ELAINE, Uh uh,96
49411,JERRY," I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .",96
49412,ELAINE, What's that?,96
49413,JERRY," Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.",96
49414,ELAINE," Oh, of course.",96
49415,JERRY," He was down at the other end. So he yells out, ""Ready, On your mark, Get set, "" and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.",96
49416,ELAINE, No.,96
49417,GEORGE, I looked up. I couldn't believe it.,96
49418,JERRY, By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.,96
49419,ELAINE, Really?,96
49420,JERRY, And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.,96
49421,ELAINE, Well what happened when you raced him again?,96
49422,JERRY, I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.,96
49423,ELAINE, So now Duncan is back?,96
49424,JERRY, He's back. And I knew he would be someday.  Man that's some tart cider!,96
49425,LOIS,Hi.,96
49426,JERRY, Hi.,96
49427,LOIS, Sorry I missed the Chinese food.,96
49428,JERRY," Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?",96
49429,LOIS, He's okay.,96
49430,JERRY, He say anything?,96
49431,LOIS, About what?,96
49432,JERRY," Oh, nothing in particular.",96
49433,LOIS, . . . Why did you cheat in that race?,96
49434,JERRY, I did not cheat.,96
49435,LOIS, He said that you got a head start.,96
49436,JERRY," Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.",96
49437,LOIS, Really?,96
49438,JERRY, Yes,96
49439,LOIS, So you WERE the fastest kid in school.,96
49440,JERRY, Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.,96
49441,ELAINE," So how was work? Another day, another dollar?",96
49442,NED, I guess.,96
49443,ELAINE, Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?,96
49444,NED," Yes, as a matter of fact I am.",96
49445,ELAINE," OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything .",96
49446,NED," Yeah, well, we still got China, and Cuba,",96
49447,ELAINE," Yeah, but come on . . .",96
49448,NED, I know it's not the same.,96
49449,ELAINE," Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous.",96
49450,NED," Yeah, we had a good run.",96
49451,ELAINE," Well, so enjoy yourself.  ha ha uh ha",96
49452,GEORGE, So you lied to her?,96
49453,JERRY, I couldn’t tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that,96
49454,ELAINE," Well, I'm dating a communist.",96
49455,JERRY," Wow, a communist. That's something.",96
49456,ELAINE," Yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it?",96
49457,GEORGE," Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?",96
49458,JERRY, The Daily Worker has personal ads?,96
49459,GEORGE, And they say appearance is not important.,96
49460,JERRY, Yours or hers?,96
49461,KRAMER, Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.,96

49471,GEORGE, What's up?,96
49472,JERRY, Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.,96
49473,GEORGE, He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.,96
49474,JERRY, That's not bad.,96
49475,GEORGE, Not bad? It's gorgeous!,96

49511,KRAMER, Double?,96
49512,NED, I bet the beard itches doesn't it?,96
49513,KRAMER, You got that straight.,96
49514,NED, So when you get a rash all over your face in January do you think Coleman's will be there with a medical plan?,96
49515,MICKEY," Look, you take that commie crap out into the street.",96

49518,MICKEY," Don't listen to him Kramer, you've got a good job here.",96
49519,DUNCAN, But there's no way you could have beaten me by that much. I already beaten you in Junior High School three times.,96
49520,JERRY," I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?",96
49521,DUNCAN, That's what I've always wondered about.,96
49522,JERRY," Well, I . . . [sees George]",96
49523,GEORGE," Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!",96

49532,GEORGE, So what have you been doing with yourself?,96
49533,JERRY, I'm I'm a comedian.,96
49534,GEORGE," Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that ""did you ever notice?"" this kind of stuff.",96
49535,JERRY," Yeah, yeah",96
49536,GEORGE, It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.,96
49537,JERRY," Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?",96
49538,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah.",96
49539,JERRY, You really used to have a think full head of hair.,96
49540,GEORGE," Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.",96
49541,JERRY," yeah, yeah.",96
49542,LOIS, What do you do?,96
49543,GEORGE, I'm an architect.,96
49544,LOIS, Have you designed any buildings in New York?,96
49545,GEORGE, Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?,96
49546,LOIS, You did that?,96
49547,GEORGE, Yep. And it didn't take very long either.,96
49548,JERRY, Well you've really built yourself up into something.,96
49549,GEORGE," Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry.",96
49550,JERRY," Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.",96
49551,GEORGE," Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.",96
49552,JERRY," Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?",96
49553,GEORGE," You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.",96
49554,JERRY," George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.",96
49555,GEORGE," Ha, uh,",96
49556,JERRY, I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.,96
49557,GEORGE," Oh, the big race.",96
49558,JERRY, Yeah.,96
49559,GEORGE," Yes, yes,.",96
49560,LOIS, You were there?,96
49561,GEORGE," Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.",96
49562,DUNCAN, Miss Stafford?,96
49563,GEORGE," Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .",96
49564,JERRY, George!,96
49565,GEORGE," But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.",96
49566,JERRY, Did I get a head start?,96
49567,GEORGE," Head start, oh no absolutely not.",96
49568,JERRY, You satisfied? So you see?,96
49569,DUNCAN," No, I'm still not convinced and I never will be.",96
49570,LOIS,Why don't the two of you just race again?,96
49571,DUNCAN, That's a good idea.,96
49572,JERRY," No, no, no, another race - out of the question.",96
49573,DUNCAN," I know, you've been saying that for twenty years because you know you can't beat me. You couldn't beat me then and you can't beat me now.",96
49574,LOIS, Race him Jerry. Race him.,96
49575,JERRY, All right! I'll do it. The race is on.,96
49576,ELAINE, . . . shut up! ,96
49577,JERRY, And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus,96
49578,KRAMER," Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.",96
49579,MICKEY, What does that mean?,96
49580,KRAMER," Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.",96
49581,MICKEY, So what if I want to open up a delicatessen?,96
49582,KRAMER, There are no delicatessens under Communism.,96
49583,MICKEY, Why not?,96
49584,KRAMER," Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.",96
49585,MICKEY, So you can't get Corned Beef?,96
49586,KRAMER," Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.",96
49587,GEORGE,"  . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. -  My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office.",96

49589,JERRY," Hello, oh hi Duncan, 4",96
49590,NED, I'm sorry Elaine. The shirt's too fancy.,96
49591,ELAINE," Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?",96
49592,NED," All right, I'll try it on.",96
49593,ELAINE, I'm going to order Chinese Food.,96
49594,NED," You're ordering from Hop Sing's, right?",96
49595,ELAINE," Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.",96
49596,NED," Elaine, when my father was black listed he couldn't work for years. He and his friends used to sit at Hop Sing's every day figuring out how to survive.",96
49597,ELAINE, You're father was blacklisted?,96
49598,NED," Yes he was, and you know why? Because he was betrayed by people he trusted. They ""named names"".",96
49599,ELAINE," Okay, okay.  Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.",96

49605,ELAINE," Okay, okay, Ned Isakoff.",96
49606,KID, I want a racing car set.,96
49607,KRAMER," Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost.",96
49608,KID, But I want a racing car set.,96
49609,KRAMER," You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.",96
49610,KID," Hey, this guy's a COMMIE!",96
49611,MICKEY," Hey, kid, quiet. Were did a nice little boy like you learn such a bad word like that? Huh?",96
49612,KID," Commie, Commie, Commie . . .  .",96
49613,MICKEY, Santa is not a Commie. He just forgot how his good friend stuck his neck out for him to get him a good job like this. Didn't he Santa!,96
49614,STORE MANAGER, Is there a problem here?,96

49623,JERRY, What's the matter?,96
49624,LOIS," I just spoke to Duncan. He said if you don't race, he's going to fire me.",96
49625,JERRY, What? He can't do that.,96
49626,LOIS, Yes he can. He controls the means of production. What are you going to do Jerry?,96
49627,JERRY, Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.,96
49628,LEW," Ah, I knew it was you! You tried to trick Hop Sing! You are onour list; Elaine Benes! And now you are on our list; Ned Isakoff.",96

49633,GEORGE," C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.",96
49634,STEINBRENNER," You know George, it struck me today me that a Communistpipeline into the vast reservoir of Cuban baseball talent could be thegreatest thing ever to happen to this organization.",96
49635,GEORGE, Sir?,96
49636,STEINBRENNER," You could be invaluable to this franchise. George, there's a southpaw down there nobody's been able to get a look at; something Rodriguez, I don't really know his name. You get yourselfdown to Havana right away.",96
49637,GEORGE," Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best.",96
49638,STEINBRENNER," Good, Merry Christmas George. And bring me back some of those cigars in the cedar boxes, you know the ones with the fancy rings? I love those fancy rings. They kind of distract you while you're smoking. The red and yellow are nice. It looks good against the brown of the cigar. The Maduro, I like the Maduro wrapper. The darker the better, that's what I say. Of course, the Claro's good too. That's more of a pale brown, almost like a milky coffee.  I find the ring size very confusing. They have it in centimeters which I don't really understand that well...",96
49639,MICKEY," That was quick! Nice job, Santa!",96
49640,KRAMER," Yeah,",96
49641,MICKEY, I knew that Commie stuff was going to get us in trouble.,96
49642,KRAMER," Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.",96
49643,MICKEY," Communism, You didn't realize Communism was a sensitive issue? What do you think has been going on in the world for the past 60 years? Wake up and smell the coffee.",96
49644,KRAMER, I guess I screwed up!,96

49646,ELAINE, How do you feel?,96
49647,JERRY, I need a miracle.,96
49648,DUNCAN, Now you're going to see what kind of liar you're mixed up with.,96
49649,LOIS, If he beats you I want a big raise.,96
49650,DUNCAN," If he beats me, I'll not only give you a raise, I'll send you to Hawaii for two weeks.",96

49668,CASTRO," And I would be honored if you would be my guest for dinner tonight at the Presidential palace. There will be girls there and, I hear, some pretty good food. Of course the problem with parties is you invariably have to eat standing up which I don't care for but on the other hand I don't like to balance a plate on my lap either. Once when I was at a party, I put my plate on someone's piano. I assure you, if I had not been a dictator, I would not have been able to get away with that one.",96
49669,JERRY, Come on. Lets go,97
49670,ELAINE," No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.",97

49680,ELAINE, Really? Grace?,97
49681,LANDIS, Yes. So have you found anything yet?,97
49682,ELAINE," Uh, no. Not really.",97
49683,LANDIS, You know you should keep in touch. Something may be opening up in a few weeks. Is that a Bruline?,97
49684,JERRY," Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one.",97
49685,ELAINE, Newman plays tennis?,97
49686,JERRY, He's fantastic.,97
49687,LANDIS, Would you mind if I tried this out?,97
49688,ELAINE," Uh, no ... take it.",97
49689,LANDIS, How will you get it back?,97
49690,ELAINE," Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.",97
49691,LANDIS, That's so generous of you.,97
49692,ELAINE, Thanks,97
49693,JERRY, You loaned her Pitt's racquet?,97
49694,ELAINE, What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.,97
49695,SANDY, I gotta get going.,97
49696,JERRY," Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.",97
49697,SANDY, ,97
49698,ELAINE, Bye,97
49699,JERRY, Bye bye,97
49700,ELAINE, Have you noticed she never laughs,97
49701,JERRY," Hm, really?",97
49702,ELAINE, Yeah,97
49703,GEORGE, Check that out ,97
49704,KRAMER," Whoa, you're dating this woman?",97
49705,GEORGE, That's right.,97
49706,KRAMER," George, you're becoming one of the gliterratti",97
49707,GEORGE, What's that.,97
49708,KRAMER," Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal.",97
49709,GEORGE, And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.,97
49710,KRAMER, Maybe she's bulimic,97
49711,GEORGE, Wa?,97
49712,KRAMER," Bulimic,",97
49713,GEORGE," Kramer, she's a model.",97
49714,KRAMER, Exactly,97
49715,GEORGE, I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.,97
49716,KRAMER, There you go monkey boy.,97
49717,NINA," Mmm, Mmmm oh, so good, mmm, mmm. Aren't you hungry?",97
49718,GEORGE, Just enjoying watching you.,97
49719,SANDY, So did you like the movie?,97
49720,JERRY," Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.",97
49721,SANDY, ,97
49722,JERRY, Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.,97
49723,SANDY,  That's funny.,97
49724,JERRY, I'm glad you enjoyed it.,97
49725,NINA," Oh, I'm so full.",97
49726,GEORGE," Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.",97
49727,NINA, Will you excuse me.,97
49728,GEORGE, Where you going?,97
49729,NINA, I just need to freshen up.,97
49730,GEORGE, You're fresh  You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.,97
49731,NINA," George I need to freshen., George, George, George ...",97
49732,JERRY, It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.,97
49733,ELAINE," See, what did I tell ya?",97
49734,JERRY," And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, ""That's funny."" ... That's funny!",97
49735,ELAINE," Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet.",97
49736,JERRY, I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!,97
49737,ELAINE," Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh.  This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad.",97
49738,GEORGE," Well, I heard a noise.",97
49739,JERRY, What noise?,97
49740,GEORGE," You know, .. blah ...",97
49741,JERRY, What blah?,97
49742,GEORGE, From the bathroom.,97
49743,JERRY," Oh, you think she was refunding?",97
49744,GEORGE, Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.,97
49745,ELAINE, So you're concerned.,97
49746,GEORGE," Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.",97
49747,JERRY, In a manner of speaking.,97
49748,GEORGE, Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.,97
49749,KRAMER, Here's your scrubber back.,97
49750,JERRY, Thanks.,97
49751,GEORGE," Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.",97
49752,JERRY, A matron?,97
49753,GEORGE, Yeah,97
49754,JERRY," uh, well I can't help you there .",97
49755,GEORGE, Wha?,97
49756,KRAMER, Nothin',97
49757,GEORGE, You know a matron?,97
49758,KRAMER, Me?,97
49759,GEORGE, You,97
49760,KRAMER, No.,97
49761,GEORGE," Kramer,",97
49762,KRAMER," Well, now look, just leave me alone.",97
49763,GEORGE," Well, what is it?",97
49764,KRAMER," No, don't, don't make me",97
49765,GEORGE, Wha?,97
49766,KRAMER," No, I can't, all right I can't ...",97
49767,GEORGE, Who?,97
49768,KRAMER, ... My mother's a matron!,97
49769,ELAINE, Babs?,97
49770,KRAMER," Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?",97
49771,GEORGE," Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.",97
49772,KRAMER," Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.",97
49773,GEORGE, Why not? Why not?,97
49774,KRAMER, let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.,97
49775,GEORGE," Come on, Kramer.",97
49776,KRAMER, I can't I can't,97
49777,JERRY, Kramer you're going to have to face her some time,97
49778,KRAMER,  b'd b'd,97
49779,ELAINE," Hello  Oh, my goodness. What happened?",97
49780,LANDIS, I tore my umeral epicondilitist,97
49781,ELAINE, Oh,97
49782,LANDIS, My doctor said it might never fully heal. I may never play again.,97
49783,ELAINE," Oh, you'll be playing ...",97
49784,LANDIS, If I can't play tennis I don't know what I'll do.,97
49785,ELAINE," There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,",97
49786,LANDIS, You don't know how lucky you are to be healthy ...,97
49787,ELAINE, ... and biking and ..,97
49788,LANDIS, What am I going to do?,97
49789,ELAINE, ... hiking ...,97
49790,LANDIS, ,97
49791,ELAINE,  Could I ...,97
49792,LANDIS, If I can't play tennis I have no reason to live .. ,97
49793,ELAINE," , You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis",97
49794,KRAMER, Ma?,97
49795,BABS, Cosmo!,97
49796,GEORGE, Cosmo?,97
49797,JERRY, Why didn't you just ask her for it?,97
49798,ELAINE, I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again,97
49799,JERRY, Yeah,97
49800,GEORGE, Hey di ho,97
49801,JERRY, C'mon up.,97
49802,JERRY, So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?,97
49803,ELAINE," augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy",97
49804,JERRY, He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?,97
49805,ELAINE, He'll only play with his racquet,97
49806,JERRY," Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?",97
49807,ELAINE, That's stealing?,97
49808,JERRY, Stealing? You loaned her the racquet!,97
49809,ELAINE, I know.,97
49810,GEORGE, Hey oh.,97
49811,ELAINE, JERRY,97
49812,JERRY, So what happened with Kramer's mother?,97
49813,GEORGE, It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.,97
49814,JERRY, What's she like?,97
49815,GEORGE," Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.",97
49816,ELAINE," Ah, I'm ready what?",97
49817,JERRY, What is it?,97
49818,GEORGE, I uh got the first name.,97
49819,ELAINE, You found out Kramer's first name?,97
49820,GEORGE, That's right. You ready?,97
49821,JERRY, We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?,97
49822,GEORGE, Cosmo,97
49823,ELAINE, JERRY,97
49824,GEORGE, Cosmo,97
49825,ELAINE, JERRY,97
49826,ELAINE," Cosmo, Cosmo?",97
49827,KRAMER, What's so funny? ... wha?,97
49828,ELAINE, COSMO?,97
49829,KRAMER," All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.",97
49830,ELAINE, It's not such a bad name.,97
49831,KRAMER, Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!,97
49832,LAURA, Yes?,97
49833,JERRY," Hi, is Sandy here?",97
49834,LAURA," Hi, you must be Jerry. Sandy's in the shower. Do you want to come in?",97
49835,JERRY, I would except I forgot to bring a towel.,97
49836,LAURA, ,97
49837,JERRY, So the roommate laughed at everything I said.,97
49838,GEORGE, Wow.,97
49839,JERRY," It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse ""ha's."" You know those?",97
49840,GEORGE, Oh yeah,97
49841,JERRY, Yeah.,97
49842,GEORGE," Hate the big coarse ""ha."" Hate those.",97
49843,JERRY, And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.,97
49844,GEORGE, I see.,97
49845,JERRY," So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.",97
49846,GEORGE," Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.",97
49847,JERRY," Can't be done, huh?",97
49848,GEORGE, The Switch?,97
49849,JERRY," ""The Switch.""",97
49850,GEORGE, Can't be done.,97
49851,JERRY, I wonder.,97
49852,GEORGE, Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!,97
49853,JERRY, They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.,97
49854,GEORGE," Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.",97
49855,JERRY," The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?",97
49856,GEORGE," All right, dammit, I'm in.",97
49857,JERRY, I couldn't do it without you.,97
49858,GEORGE, All right. Let's get to work.,97
49859,GEORGE, All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.,97
49860,JERRY," Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!",97
49861,GEORGE, We'll come up with something.,97
49862,JERRY," Yeah, sure we will.",97
49863,GEORGE, All right. See you tomorrow. ,97
49864,GEORGE, I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!,97
49865,GEORGE," All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.",97
49866,JERRY, All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a ménage à trois with her and her roommate.,97
49867,GEORGE, That's right.,97
49868,JERRY," And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.",97
49869,GEORGE, Keep going.,97
49870,JERRY," At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.",97
49871,GEORGE, Continue.,97
49872,JERRY, The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.,97
49873,GEORGE," A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.",97
49874,JERRY," Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it",97
49875,GEORGE," You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, ""If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem.""",97
49876,JERRY, It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.,97
49877,GEORGE, This is what I do.,97
49878,KEITH, Can I help you?,97
49879,ELAINE," Uh, no, I'm OK.",97
49880,KEITH, Well then what are you doing with that racquet?,97
49881,ELAINE," Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it.",97
49882,KEITH," Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no no no..",97
49883,ELAINE," No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.",97
49884,KEITH, Look sweetheart I don't know who you are. I don't know what you're doing here. But...,97
49885,ELAINE, All right. I'm going I'm going,97
49886,KEITH, Not with ...,97
49887,ELAINE, Give it give it ..,97
49888,KEITH, Leave ...,97
49889,ELAINE, All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?,97
49890,KEITH, I don't have to but I will.,97
49891,CLOTWORTHY, Morning Cosmo,97
49892,KRAMER, Hi Mr. Clotworthy,97
49893,CLOTWORTHY, How are you today?,97

49899,KRAMER," Yes, It's a fine day",97
49900,VOICE,  What do you say Cosmo?,97
49901,KRAMER," Hey, everything my man.",97
49902,SANDY, What,97
49903,JERRY," You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois.",97
49904,SANDY," Oooo, that is a wild idea",97
49905,JERRY, Uh?,97
49906,KRAMER," You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.",97
49907,BABS," Yes, well isn't that just easy for you to say. What the hell do you think I'm going to do with myself?",97
49908,KRAMER, Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?,97
49909,BABS, I've been clean for two years. Anyway what would we do together?,97
49910,KRAMER, I've got plenty of ideas.,97
49911,BABS, I've always believed in you Cosmo. You know that. So I want you to call that place today and tell then tha you're through.,97
49912,BABS, All right. I'll do it.,97
49913,NINA, Mmmm mm so good.,97
49914,GEORGE, ... so glad.,97
49915,NINA, Will you excuse me I've got to freshen up.,97
49916,GEORGE, And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh,97
49917,WOMAN, I'll be back. I'm not feeling very well.,97
49918,WAITRESS, Care to see our dessert menu?,97
49919,GEORGE," Uh, yeah. Do you know Babs?",97
49920,WAITRESS," Oh, yeah I was sorry to hear she left.",97
49921,GEORGE, Babs left?,97
49922,WAITRESS, She quit today.,97
49923,GEORGE, Ah Ha.,97
49924,NINA, What are you doing here George?,97
49925,GEORGE, I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.,97
49926,GEORGE, How 'ya feelin'?,97
49927,BABS, Hi Newman,97
49928,NEWMAN, Hi Babs,97
49929,BABS, What are you doin',97
49930,NEWMAN, Minding my own business.,97
49931,BABS, You'll never get into trouble that way.,97
49932,NEWMAN, What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?,97
49933,BABS, From what I hear you postmen don't have to look too far.,97
49934,NEWMAN, ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette?,97
49935,BABS, Don't mind if I do.,97
49936,JERRY, Hey,97
49937,GEORGE, What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. The whole thing blew up in my face.,97
49938,JERRY," Ah, that's a shame.",97
49939,GEORGE," Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?",97
49940,JERRY," Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.",97
49941,GEORGE, So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?,97
49942,JERRY," No actually, she took it pretty well.",97
49943,GEORGE, So what happened?,97
49944,JERRY, She's into it.,97
49945,GEORGE, Into what?,97
49946,JERRY, The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.,97
49947,GEORGE, That's unbelievable.,97
49948,JERRY," Oh, it's a scene man.",97
49949,GEORGE, Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia?,97
49950,JERRY, What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.,97
49951,GEORGE," You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?",97
49952,JERRY, I can't. I'm not an orgy guy.,97
49953,GEORGE, Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.,97
49954,JERRY," Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.",97
49955,GEORGE, If only something like that could happen to me.,97
49956,JERRY," Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.",97
49957,GEORGE, I know.,97
49958,JERRY," Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?",97
49959,ELAINE," No, I got caught.",97
49960,JERRY, What do you mean you got caught?,97
49961,ELAINE, Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.,97
49962,JERRY, I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.,97
49963,ELAINE, Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.,97
49964,KRAMER, Hey.,97
49965,JERRY, Hi Cosmo.,97
49966,ELAINE, Hi Cosmo,97
49967,KRAMER, Thanks man.,97
49968,JERRY," Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?",97
49969,KRAMER," Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.",97
49970,JERRY," Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?",97
49971,KRAMER, Yeah,97
49972,JERRY, Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.,97
49973,KRAMER, All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's,97
49974,GEORGE," Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry.",97
49975,KRAMER, She quit.,97
49976,GEORGE, It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.,97
49977,KRAMER," Don't talk to me George, talk to her.",97
49978,GEORGE, Well where is she?,97
49979,KRAMER, I don't know.,97
49980,KRAMER, Ma!,97
49981,BABS, Cosmo!,97
49982,NEWMAN," We din, we didn't ... ... Cosmo?",97
49983,JERRY,  You sure you don't want the tickets?,98
49984,GEORGE,  No thanks.,98
49985,JERRY,  I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.,98
49986,GEORGE,"  I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.",98
49987,JERRY,"  I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.",98
49988,GEORGE,  Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?,98
49989,JERRY,  Maybe he didn't know?,98
49990,GEORGE,  Lemme see.  I can't believe you got these for free.   Row F?!,98
49991,JERRY,"  Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.",98
49992,GEORGE,"  Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?",98
49993,JERRY,"  I asked.  Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.",98
49994,GEORGE,  Wish I could help you.,98
49995,JERRY,"  Come on, take them.  You could take Bonnie.",98
49996,GEORGE,  You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?,98
49997,JERRY,  What do you think?,98
49998,GEORGE,"  So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars.  Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.",98
49999,JERRY,"  Yeah, sleeping arrangements.  So, you haven't, uh...",98
50000,GEORGE,"   Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet.  Tomorrow night's the first night.",98
50001,JERRY,  Aah.,98
50002,GEORGE,"  Hey, is that Tim Whatley?",98
50003,JERRY,  The Dentist?,98
50004,GEORGE,"  Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?",98
50005,JERRY,"  Oh, no.  I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.",98
50006,GEORGE,  Oh good.,98
50007,JERRY,"  Yeah, I blamed it on you.  Hi Tim.",98
50008,TIM,  Hey Jerry!  George.  What are you up to?,98
50009,JERRY,"  Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.",98
50010,GEORGE,  I'm getting a makeover.,98
50011,JERRY,  Hey.  How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?,98
50012,TIM,"  What, are you kidding?",98
50013,JERRY,  Here.  Two tickets.  Have a good time.,98
50014,TIM,"  How can I think you?  I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner sometime.  You ever been to Mendys?",98
50015,JERRY,  No no no.  No dinner.,98
50016,JERRY,"  Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift.  I know, it's a label maker.  The Label Baby Junior.  Yeah, I hear they're good.  Well, label me thankful.  Okay, well you enjoy those tickets.  Buh-bye.",98
50017,JERRY,  Come in.,98
50018,KRAMER,  Where can I put this?,98
50019,JERRY,  What is it?,98
50020,KRAMER,"  It's Risk, Jerry.  The game of world conquest.   Alright, that's perfect.",98
50021,JERRY,"  Kramer, why do you have to   Hello, Newman.",98
50022,NEWMAN,"  Hello, Jerry.  Will he take it?  I gotta go to work.",98
50023,JERRY,  Take what?,98
50024,KRAMER,"  The board, Jerry.  We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.",98
50025,JERRY,  So why don't you leave it at Newman's?,98
50026,NEWMAN,"  I wanted to, he won't let me.",98
50027,KRAMER,  We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.,98
50028,JERRY,  So that's here?,98
50029,KRAMER,"  Yes, yes.  You're like Switzerland.",98
50030,JERRY,  I don't wanna be Switzerland.,98
50031,KRAMER,"  Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination.  It's winner take all.  People cannot be trusted.",98
50032,NEWMAN,  Don't look at me.,98
50033,KRAMER,"  Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.",98
50034,JERRY,"  Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out.",98
50035,KRAMER,"  Alright, so you're gonna look after it?",98
50036,JERRY,"  Yeah, yeah.",98
50037,KRAMER,  Stay strong buddy.,98
50038,JERRY,  Yeah.,98
50039,KRAMER, Watch it good.,98
50040,JERRY,  Ok.,98
50041,ELAINE,  Hey.,98
50042,JERRY,  Hey.,98
50043,ELAINE,"  Hey.  Oh, is that a label maker?",98
50044,JERRY,"  Yes it is.  I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.",98
50045,ELAINE,"  Love the Label Baby, baby.  You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.",98
50046,JERRY,  Tim Whatley?,98
50047,ELAINE,  Yeah.  Who sent you that one?,98
50048,JERRY,  One Tim Whatley!,98
50049,ELAINE,"  Not, my Tim Whatley?",98
50050,JERRY,"  The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.",98
50051,ELAINE,  I think this is the same one I gave him.  He recycled this gift.  He's a regifter!,98
50052,JERRY,"  Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing.  Perhaps it's an homage.",98
50053,ELAINE,"  Yeah, perhaps.",98
50054,JERRY,  Well how did he react when you gave it to him?,98
50055,ELAINE,"  Um, he said, ""Oh.  A label maker.  Howbout that?""",98
50056,JERRY,  He repeated the name of the gift?,98
50057,ELAINE,"  Yeah, so?",98
50058,JERRY,"  Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.",98
50059,ELAINE,  What do you mean?,98
50060,JERRY,"  Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, ""Oh. Tube socks.""  What are you gonna do about it?",98
50061,ELAINE,"  I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.",98
50062,JERRY,  Why'd you get him a gift anyway?,98
50063,ELAINE,"  Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.",98
50064,JERRY,"  Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.",98
50065,BONNIE,"  Well, here we are.  This is the place.",98
50066,GEORGE,  Wow.,98
50067,BONNIE,  Do you like it?,98
50068,GEORGE,"  I love it!  This is fantastic!  Look at this couch, is this velvet?!",98
50069,BONNIE,  Are you a velvet fan?,98
50070,GEORGE,"  A fan?  I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!",98
50071,BONNIE,"  Aren't they great?   Oh, Scott, hi. This is George.  George, this is Scott, my roommate.",98
50072,GEORGE,   Heh heh.,98
50073,BONNIE,"  Here, check out this view.  If you lean out this window, you can see the river.",98
50074,GEORGE,"  So Scott's your roommate, huh?",98
50075,BONNIE,"  Yes.  Oh, I'm sure I've mentioned him.",98
50076,GEORGE,"  No, you didn't mention it.",98
50077,BONNIE,"  He's a great guy, you'll really like him.",98
50078,GEORGE,  I'm sure I will.,98
50079,JERRY,"  Male roommate, huh?",98
50080,GEORGE,  Yes.  A male roommate.,98
50081,JERRY,  Is this a problem?,98
50082,GEORGE,"  It's a huge problem, Jerry.  The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place!  He's already got that.",98
50083,JERRY,"  Well, maybe he's --",98
50084,GEORGE,"  No.  Believe me, he's not.",98
50085,JERRY,  So he's an eligible receiver.,98
50086,GEORGE,"  She's confiding in him about our dates.  You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date!  It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'",98
50087,JERRY,  What's stopping them?,98
50088,GEORGE,  Exactly!  You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.,98
50089,JERRY,  What does he look like?,98
50090,GEORGE,"  Oh, that's the worst part of it.  He looks just like me.",98
50091,JERRY,  He looks like you and he's working from the inside?,98
50092,GEORGE,  I look like me and I'm working from the outside.  Who do you think is in the better position?,98
50093,JERRY,  Not you.,98
50094,GEORGE,  Ho ho.  This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!,98
50095,JERRY,  We'll take a check please.,98
50096,GEORGE," I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment.  It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet.  You know, if it were socially acceptable--",98
50097,JERRY,"  I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.",98
50098,GEORGE,  I've said that before?,98
50099,JERRY,"  Many times.  You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.",98
50100,KRAMER,   Hey.,98
50101,GEORGE,  Hey.,98
50102,JERRY,  Hey.,98
50103,KRAMER,  Guess what?  I saw Newman talking to the super.,98
50104,JERRY,  So what?,98
50105,KRAMER,  The super has keys to your apartment.  Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.,98
50106,JERRY,"  Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.",98
50107,KRAMER,"  Yeah, alright, fine.  You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world.  But he'd be a horrible leader.  And you know who's gonna suffer?  The little people; you and George.",98
50108,JERRY,  Are you through?,98
50109,KRAMER,"  Oh.  I talked to Arthur Jobanian.  Yeah, the Drake's wedding?  That's off.",98
50110,JERRY,  The wedding is off?  What happened?,98
50111,KRAMER,"  The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl.  So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.",98
50112,GEORGE,  The wedding is off.  Now you can go to the Super Bowl.,98
50113,JERRY,  I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.,98
50114,GEORGE,"  You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.",98
50115,JERRY,  Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving?  There's no grace period.,98
50116,GEORGE,"  Well, didn't he regift the label maker?",98
50117,JERRY,  Possibly.,98
50118,GEORGE,"  Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?",98
50119,JERRY,  You may have a point.,98
50120,GEORGE,"  I have a point, I have a point.",98
50121,JERRY,"  Alright, I'll call him.",98
50122,GEORGE,  Yeah.  What's that?,98
50123,JERRY,"  Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives.   Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you?  Well it turns out I can use them.  Oh, you do?  I understand.  Okay.  Bye.  He already made plans, he can't change them.",98
50124,GEORGE,"   Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.",98
50125,JERRY,  Thanks.,98
50126,GEORGE,"  Alright, I gotta go.  I'm heading over to Bonnie's.",98
50127,JERRY,  What are you gonna do about the roommate?,98
50128,GEORGE,  I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him.  It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.,98
50129,JERRY,"  Well, the pickle breath is a good start.",98
50130,NEWMAN,"  Hello Jerry, may I come in?",98
50131,JERRY,  What do you want?,98
50132,NEWMAN,"   Nothing, just being neighborly.  Do you wanna hang out?  Shoot the breeze?",98
50133,JERRY,"  I'm not letting you cheat, Newman.  You're not getting anywhere near that board.",98
50134,NEWMAN,  Jerry?  I'm a little insulted.,98
50135,JERRY,"  You're not a little anything, Newman.  So just pack it up and move it out of here.",98
50136,NEWMAN,"   Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?",98
50137,JERRY,"  I dunno, watch it on TV I guess.  Why?",98
50138,NEWMAN,"  Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me.  I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.",98
50139,JERRY,  You're going to the Super Bowl?,98
50140,NEWMAN,"  Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.",98
50141,JERRY,  What's his name?,98
50142,NEWMAN,  Tim Whatley.,98
50143,JERRY,  That's my ticket!,98
50144,NEWMAN,"  Is it?!  Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me!  Ha ha ha.",98
50145,JERRY,   Newman!,98
50146,GEORGE,  What a movie.  Good choice.,98
50147,BONNIE,  Thank Scott.  He recommended it.,98
50148,GEORGE,"  Oh, Scott, Scott.  He's really great, isn't he?",98
50149,BONNIE,  Yes he is.,98
50150,GEORGE,"  Yes he is.  Let me ask you something.  When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?",98
50151,BONNIE,  George?,98
50152,GEORGE,"  Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?",98
50153,BONNIE,"  George, you're being ridiculous.",98
50154,GEORGE,  What's the massage situation?,98
50155,BONNIE,  What do you mean?,98
50156,GEORGE,"  Is there any work being done?  Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?",98
50157,BONNIE,"  George, would you just stop?",98
50158,GEORGE,"  Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit?  I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?",98
50159,BONNIE,"  George, what is wrong with you?",98
50160,GEORGE,"  I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate!  It's unnatural, it's an abomination!",98
50161,SCOTT,  Hey!,98
50162,GEORGE,  Hey!,98
50163,SCOTT,  How ya going?,98
50164,GEORGE,  I'm good.,98
50165,SCOTT,  Are you gonna need the bathroom?  'Cause I'm gonna jump in the shower.,98
50166,BONNIE,"  No, just throw my bras out of the way.",98
50167,TIM,"  Well, this is my building.",98
50168,ELAINE,  Yes it is.,98
50169,TIM,"  This was fun, you know?",98
50170,ELAINE,  Yeah.,98
50171,TIM,"  So, I'll call.",98
50172,ELAINE,  Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?,98
50173,TIM,  Upstairs?  You wanna go upstairs?,98
50174,ELAINE,  I would love to go upstairs.,98
50175,TIM,"  Elaine, you are something else.  No one can ever put a label on you, huh?",98
50176,ELAINE,  We'll see.,98
50177,JERRY,  Newman.  He's going with Newman.,98
50178,GEORGE,  How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?,98
50179,JERRY,  Newman's his mailman.,98
50180,GEORGE,  Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!,98
50181,JERRY,  Who goes *anywhere* with Newman?!,98
50182,GEORGE,"  Well, he's merry.",98
50183,JERRY,"  He is merry, I'll give him that.   What's this plant for?",98
50184,GEORGE,  I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.,98
50185,JERRY,"  Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.",98
50186,ELAINE,"  Hey, guess what?  I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.",98
50187,JERRY,  What?,98
50188,ELAINE,  We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.,98
50189,JERRY,  What about the label maker?,98
50190,ELAINE,"  Ah, well.",98
50191,JERRY,"  Wait a minute, that's my ticket!  You didn't even want to go.",98
50192,ELAINE,"  It was totally out of the blue.  We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.",98
50193,JERRY,"  So, how did you get up there?  Did you say you had to use the bathroom?",98
50194,ELAINE,  No.,98
50195,JERRY,  Then how'd you get up there?,98
50196,ELAINE,"  I said, ""Do you wanna go upstairs?""",98
50197,GEORGE,  And there's you ticket.,98
50198,ELAINE,  What?,98
50199,JERRY,  That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.,98
50200,ELAINE,  Why?,98
50201,JERRY,"  You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West?  Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.",98
50202,ELAINE,"  You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?",98
50203,JERRY,  Obviously.,98
50204,ELAINE,  You're crazy.,98
50205,GEORGE,"  Well, what happened when you got upstairs?",98
50206,ELAINE,"  As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave.  I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.",98
50207,JERRY,"  Yeah, well I don't trust this guy.  I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.",98
50208,KRAMER,  Hey.,98
50209,JERRY,  Hey.  What are you doing?,98
50210,KRAMER,  I'm watching your door.,98
50211,JERRY,  My door?,98
50212,KRAMER,"   Yeah, from my peephole.  Fisheye, sees all.",98
50213,JERRY,   What was that?,98
50214,KRAMER,  Newman!,98
50215,NEWMAN,   Damn!,98
50216,JERRY,   The bedroom!,98
50217,JERRY,"  I see you, Newman!  I see you!",98
50218,KRAMER,  I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!,98
50219,ELAINE,  I've got a confession to make.,98
50220,TIM,  Oh?  What's that?,98
50221,ELAINE,  I've got Super Bowl fever.,98
50222,TIM,"  Oh yeah, me too.",98
50223,ELAINE,  So where are we staying?,98
50224,TIM,"  Oh, the Ambassador.",98
50225,ELAINE,  Oh.  Big room?,98
50226,TIM,"  It's a regular room, but it's right downtown.",98
50227,ELAINE,  Downtown?,98
50228,TIM,  Right downtown.,98
50229,ELAINE,"  What do they have there, a couple of beds?",98
50230,TIM,  Why?  You bringing someone else?,98
50231,ELAINE,"  No, but don't you think there should be two beds?  There's two of us.",98
50232,BONNIE,"  Oh, a cactus.",98
50233,GEORGE,"  They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.",98
50234,SCOTT,"  Well, look who's here.",98
50235,BONNIE,  I asked Scott to move out.,98
50236,GEORGE,  Oh.  Oh!,98
50237,JERRY,  So she kicked him out of the apartment.,98
50238,GEORGE,  That's right.  It's just me and her.,98
50239,JERRY,"  Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.",98
50240,GEORGE,"  I guess she did.  He's gone, now I'm the man.",98
50241,JERRY,  That's not a good role for you.,98
50242,GEORGE,"  No, it's not.",98
50243,JERRY,  You unwittingly made a major commitment.  That's a lot of pressure.,98
50244,GEORGE,  Oh my god.,98
50245,JERRY,"  You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.",98
50246,GEORGE,"  I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.",98
50247,JERRY,  He was shouldering.,98
50248,GEORGE,   I couldn't leave well enough alone?!,98
50249,JERRY,  Where are you going?,98
50250,GEORGE,  I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.,98
50251,JERRY,"  Oh, well here.  Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.",98
50252,GEORGE,  Thanks.,98
50253,KRAMER,  Yeah.  I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.,98
50254,JERRY,"  So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?",98
50255,NEWMAN,"  Yeah.  I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.",98
50256,JERRY,"   Thanks for having me over, guys.",98
50257,JERRY,"  Alright, I'll see you later.",98
50258,TIM,  Hey Jerry?,98
50259,JERRY,"  Ah, Tim Whatley.  Out scalping?",98
50260,TIM,"  Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible.  Listen, I want to give you a ticket back.",98
50261,JERRY,"  Are you serious, what about Elaine?",98
50262,TIM," Oh, Elaine.  Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they would.",98
50263,JERRY,"  Oh.    Hey, isn't this Kramer's car?   Hey, Cosmo!!  They're towing your car!!",98
50264,KRAMER,   What?!  Not my car!!  Hey!!  They're towing my car!!,98
50265,NEWMAN,  What are you doing?,98
50266,KRAMER,  I'm taking the board with me.,98
50267,TIM,"  So, I guess I'll see you at the game.",98
50268,JERRY,"  Yeah, see you there.",98
50269,BONNIE,"  Hi, George.",98
50270,GEORGE,"  What, what happened?  Where's, where's all the stuff?",98
50271,BONNIE,  It's gone.  It was all his.  Is this a label maker?,98
50272,GEORGE,"  The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?",98
50273,BONNIE,"  They were his.  Besides, we don't need any of those things.  We have each other.",98
50274,NEWMAN,  Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?,98
50275,KRAMER,"  Oh, stop stalling.  Come on.",98
50276,NEWMAN,"  I can't think, there's all this noise.",98
50277,KRAMER,  Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland?  I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.,98
50278,NEWMAN,  I'm not beaten yet.  I still have armies in the Ukraine.,98
50279,KRAMER,"  Ha ha, the Ukraine.  Do you know what the Ukraine is?  It's a sitting duck.  A road apple, Newman.  The Ukraine is weak.  It's feeble.  I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.",98
50280,UKRAINIAN,  I come from Ukraine.  You not say Ukraine weak.,98
50281,KRAMER,"  Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.",98
50282,UKRAINIAN,  Ukraine is game to you?!  Howbout I take your little board and smash it!!,98
50283,ELAINE,"  Hello, Tim.",98
50284,TIM,"   Elaine, hi.",98
50285,ELAINE,"  Don't worry, Tim.  I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all.  I just came by to pick up my label maker.  I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.",98
50286,TIM,  But you gave it to me.,98
50287,ELAINE,"  But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl.  Hand it over, Whatley.",98
50288,TIM,"  Uh, ok.",98
50289,ELAINE,"  You don't have the label maker, do you?",98
50290,TIM,"  Uh, no.",98
50291,ELAINE,  I knew it!  You're a regifter!,98
50292,TIM,"  Oh, yeah, some gift.  That thing didn't work at all.",98
50293,ELAINE,  What?,98
50294,TIM,"  You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right off.  It was the worst gift I ever got.",98
50295,ELAINE,"   Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work.  The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.",98
50296,TIM,"  Oh, Elaine!",98
50297,JERRY,"  H... G... F.  Seat four.  One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.",98
50298,NEWMAN,"  Hello, Jerry.  Tim couldn't make it, he's in love.  Isn't that wonderful?",98
50299,JERRY,"  Oh, it's enchanting.",98
50300,BONNIE,  Hi.,98
50301,GEORGE,"  Here's the TV.  I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl.  Do you at least have some towels we could sit on?  It's, like, a four hour game.",98
50302,BONNIE,"  George, Scott's gonna drop by.  He said he never got his boxes.  I'll get the towels.",98
50303,GEORGE,"   How am I gonna get out of this?  Think Costanza, think!",98
50304,BONNIE,  Here we are.,98
50305,GEORGE,"  Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.",98
50306,BONNIE,  What is it?,98
50307,GEORGE,"  Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Ménage à Trois?",98
50308,BONNIE,  What?,98
50309,SCOTT,  Hi.,98
50310,BONNIE,  Scott!  Remember what we talked about the other day?  George is into it.,98
50311,SCOTT,  Oh really?!,98
50312,NEWMAN,"  Great streak of luck I'm having.  First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.",98
50313,JERRY,  Can you move over at all?!,98
50314,NEWMAN,"  And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels.  No labels, Jerry.  You know what that means?  Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.",98
50315,JERRY,  An inch!  Can you move over an inch?!?,98
50316,JERRY,"The big new accessory with eyeglasses, seems to be that strap, that connects in the back so you can take 'em on and off. Which I don't get, because I thought, if you have glasses, isn't that because you need to wear glasses? 'You need glasses', isn't that what they say? I mean, an eye doctor doesn't say 'Would you care for some glasses?' When people have crutches, they don't have like a little chain attached to their belt, so they can just let go of 'em every now and then. Why not get a toupee with a rubber band for when you're water-skiing, the thing could just... ",99
50317,GARY, Hey George.,99
50318,GEORGE," Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.",99
50319,GARY, I know. I've been pretty busy.,99
50320,GEORGE," Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?",99
50321,GARY," Mostly chemotherapy. 'Kay, I'll see you.",99
50322,KRAMER,  Hey pig!,99
50323,COP,  Hey! Hey! Hey!,99
50324,JERRY, So you called the cop a pig?,99
50325,KRAMER, I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.,99
50326,JERRY, Didn't you explain that to the cop?,99
50327,KRAMER," No, I fled the scene.",99
50328,JERRY,  Hey.,99
50329,KRAMER,  Hey buddy.,99
50330,GEORGE," Hey, uh...",99
50331,KRAMER, What?,99
50332,GEORGE," Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.",99
50333,KRAMER, Oh. What about?,99
50334,GEORGE, Kramer...,99
50335,KRAMER," Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?",99
50336,GEORGE," Hey, you're hurting me!",99
50337,KRAMER," You gonna share it with me next time, huh?",99
50338,GEORGE," I swear, I swear!",99
50339,KRAMER," Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.",99
50340,GEORGE," Right, I got news. You ready?  Gary Fogel had cancer.",99
50341,JERRY," Oh yeah, I knew.",99
50342,GEORGE, You knew? How did you know?,99
50343,JERRY, He told me a few months ago.,99
50344,GEORGE, Why did he tell you and not me?,99
50345,JERRY, I don't know.,99
50346,GEORGE, How are you closer to him than me?,99
50347,GEORGE," So, is he okay?",99
50348,JERRY," Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.",99
50349,GEORGE," Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?",99
50350,JERRY," No, he was on his regular bed.",99
50351,GEORGE, So why didn't you tell me?,99
50352,JERRY, He swore me to secrecy.,99
50353,GEORGE, So?,99
50354,JERRY, It's not like you're my wife.,99
50355,GEORGE," Well, I still think you shoulda told me.",99
50356,JERRY," Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.",99
50357,GEORGE," Well, I wanna talk to him about this.",99
50358,JERRY," That's right, you let him have it.",99
50359,GEORGE, Mmm-mm.,99
50360,JERRY, Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?,99
50361,GEORGE, That's what I'm saying.,99
50362,JERRY, His illness is your business.,99
50363,GEORGE," If not mine, whose?",99
50364,JERRY," If not now, when?",99
50365,ELAINE, Were you just talking about me?,99
50366,GEORGE," No, an old friend of ours, Gary.",99
50367,ELAINE," Oh, the guy with cancer?",99
50368,GEORGE,  You told her? She's not your wife!,99
50369,JERRY," If I told you, you woulda given it away.",99
50370,GEORGE, You don't think I can keep a secret?,99
50371,JERRY," No, but he would've read your face.",99
50372,GEORGE, You don't trust my poker face?,99
50373,JERRY, Do you ever win at poker?,99
50374,GEORGE,  No.,99
50375,KRAMER," Hey.  Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.",99
50376,ELAINE," Egh, Jake Jarmel?",99
50377,KRAMER, Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.,99
50378,ELAINE, Why? You don't wear glasses.,99
50379,KRAMER," I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.",99
50380,GEORGE," I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.",99
50381,KRAMER," Yeah, I've considered that.  Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?",99
50382,ELAINE," Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.",99
50383,KRAMER, Ah.,99
50384,ELAINE," You know, we had a really bad break-up.",99
50385,JERRY, The Jujy Fruits?,99
50386,ELAINE,"  Yeah, the Jujy Fruits.",99
50387,JAKE," Okay, K-Man, enjoy the book.",99
50388,KRAMER," Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?",99
50389,JAKE, I can't tell you that.,99
50390,KRAMER, So you don't know where you got 'em?,99
50391,JAKE, Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.,99
50392,KRAMER," Well, that's peculiar. ",99
50393,GEORGE," Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.",99
50394,GARY, Really?,99
50395,GEORGE," Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.",99
50396,GARY," Oh, I talked to Debby Bibelo. She said to say hi.",99
50397,GEORGE,"  Really?  You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.",99
50398,GARY," Well frankly, you can't keep a secret. You know, you'd get two pair, the whole table knows.",99
50399,GEORGE, Well I still think it was wrong.,99
50400,GARY," Right, well I'm sorry, all right. I guess I was just thinking of myself.",99
50401,GEORGE,  Yes.,99
50402,KRAMER," ...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.",99
50403,COP, Yeah? So why didn't you?,99
50404,KRAMER, Scared of being shot.,99
50405,COP," Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine was never paid, and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give me the slip time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but he's become my 'white whale'. Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again!",99
50406,KRAMER, I like that eye patch.,99
50407,GEORGE,"  All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.",99
50408,GARY,"  Hey, George, listen. You know that company I work for, they own that parking lot around the corner.",99
50409,GEORGE," Wha, that's a Kinney lot?",99
50410,GARY," Yeah, and there's a space opening up, and I could get it for you. You just have to pay the tax on it. It'd be like, fifty a month.",99
50411,GEORGE," Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.",99
50412,GARY," All right, I got lunch, all right.",99
50413,GEORGE, You still owe me a secret.,99
50414,GARY," All right, listen. There is something I haven't told you, all right?",99
50415,GEORGE, Yeah?,99
50416,GARY," Yeah, but uhm, you can't tell Jerry.",99
50417,GEORGE, What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.,99
50418,GARY," Okay. Well, the thing is, I've been living a lie.",99
50419,GEORGE, Just one? I'm living like twenty.  What's yours?,99
50420,GARY," Well, I  I never actually had cancer.  I'll see you. ",99
50421,ELAINE, So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?,99
50422,KRAMER,  Flat out refused! ,99
50423,ELAINE," Yeah, isn't that just like him?  You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.",99
50424,KRAMER," Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister.  Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.",99
50425,ELAINE, What?  You told Jake I said hi?,99
50426,KRAMER, Yeah.,99
50427,ELAINE, I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi!  When did I say hi?,99
50428,JERRY, I never heard her say hi.,99
50429,KRAMER," Well, it's uh, common courtesy.",99
50430,ELAINE," No, no.  Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.",99
50431,JERRY, It's like a game of tag.,99
50432,JERRY, Where you going?,99
50433,ELAINE, Nowhere.,99
50434,JERRY," You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?",99
50435,ELAINE, So what if I do? ,99
50436,KRAMER,"  Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there,  maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses.  Elaine!",99
50437,JERRY, Hey. How'd it go with Gary?,99
50438,GEORGE,"  Fine, fine. ",99
50439,JERRY,  Really?,99
50440,GEORGE,  Yeah.,99
50441,JERRY, You look like something's on your mind.,99
50442,GEORGE, No. Nothing. Fine. ,99
50443,JERRY," So, that's your poker face.",99
50444,GEORGE, My regular face.,99
50445,JERRY, No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.,99
50446,GEORGE, What are you saying?,99
50447,JERRY," All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? ",99
50448,GEORGE, I got nothing.,99
50449,JERRY," What you got, a pair of bullets?",99
50450,GEORGE, What you talking about?,99
50451,JERRY, Two pair? Three of a kind?,99
50452,GEORGE, Will you stop it?,99
50453,JERRY," Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!",99
50454,GEORGE, I don't have a flush.,99
50455,JERRY," A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling!  What d'you got!",99
50456,GEORGE,  Gary Fogel never had cancer!,99
50457,ELAINE," So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.",99
50458,JAKE, You're saying you didn't say hi.,99
50459,ELAINE, That's what I'm saying.,99
50460,JAKE, So that's what you came down here to tell me?,99
50461,ELAINE, Correct.,99
50462,JAKE, You never said hi?,99
50463,ELAINE, Correct.,99
50464,JAKE," You still like me, don't you?",99
50465,ELAINE, Correct.  What's that?,99
50466,MAN," Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day.",99
50467,ELAINE,"  How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?",99
50468,JAKE," Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.",99
50469,ELAINE," Ah, Jake...  I, uh...",99
50470,GEORGE," The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.",99
50471,JERRY, So what was wrong with him?,99
50472,GEORGE, Nothing!,99
50473,JERRY, So he's been lying to me for two months?!,99
50474,GEORGE, That's right.,99
50475,JERRY," What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.",99
50476,GEORGE, Well...,99
50477,JERRY, I don't even think you could do it.,99
50478,GEORGE," Oh, I could do it.",99
50479,JERRY," Yeah, I guess you could.",99
50480,GEORGE,  C'mon.,99
50481,JERRY," Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?",99
50482,GEORGE, You did that?,99
50483,JERRY," Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. ",99
50484,GEORGE," Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. ",99
50485,JERRY, Why not?,99
50486,GEORGE,"  Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.",99
50487,JERRY," So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?",99
50488,GEORGE, Yeah.,99
50489,JERRY," Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.",99
50490,GEORGE," Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.",99
50491,JERRY, Why didn't he tell me?,99
50492,GEORGE, Because you were being so nice.,99
50493,JERRY, I don't think I can be that nice.,99
50494,GEORGE,  You be nice!,99
50495,JERRY, Gary?,99
50496,GARY, What d'you think? Check it out. ,99
50497,JERRY, Is that from my gift certificate?,99
50498,GARY, Yeah buddy. You really came through for me man. You've been so nice. ,99
50499,JERRY,"  Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.",99
50500,GARY," Hey, you know what I'm thinking of doing? I'm getting rid of all my fillings, 'cos that mercury's toxic. Hey, let me see your fillings.",99
50501,JERRY, I don't think so.,99
50502,GARY," Oh come on, open up. Let me take a look.",99
50503,GEORGE , You be nice! He's giving me a parking space  parking space... parking space...,99
50504,GARY,"  Well, what d'you know. Hey, lookee there, you're loaded.",99
50505,JERRY, Okay. ,99
50506,GARY," Hey, look who's over there. Miss Cool-toes. Check this out, Jack! ",99
50507,KRAMER,  Hey buddy.,99
50508,JERRY, Hey. Look at you. Wha... what's this?,99
50509,KRAMER, It's an eyepatch.,99
50510,JERRY, You look like a pirate.,99
50511,KRAMER, I wanna be a pirate.,99
50512,JERRY,  This is Gary.,99
50513,KRAMER,  How you doing?,99
50514,GARY, All right.,99
50515,KRAMER," Well, I tell you there's only one problem.",99
50516,JERRY, Can't see on your right side?,99
50517,KRAMER," No. It's uh,  it's itchy",99
50518,DEBBY, Nice car.,99
50519,GEORGE, Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.,99
50520,DEBBY," So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?",99
50521,GEORGE," Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.",99
50522,DEBBY, I didn't say hi.,99
50523,GEORGE, You didn't?,99
50524,DEBBY," Uh, no. I told him to send you my regards. I didn't say hi.",99
50525,GEORGE, Regards?,99
50526,DEBBY," Yeah, regards.",99
50527,ELAINE," Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?",99
50528,CABBIE,  Smugness is not a good quality.,99
50529,ELAINE,"  Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car.  Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.",99
50530,CABBIE, Good. Revenge is very good.,99
50531,ELAINE,"  'Scuse me! 'Scuse me.  Excuse me, sir. Sir?",99
50532,GUY, Yes?,99
50533,ELAINE," Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?",99
50534,GUY, Malaysia.,99
50535,ELAINE, Malaysia?,99
50536,GUY, Yeah.,99
50537,ELAINE," Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?",99
50538,GUY," Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair.",99
50539,ELAINE,  Oh! ,99
50540,GUY," But I, I can barely see without these.",99
50541,ELAINE, C'mon.,99
50542,GUY," Well, these were expensive.",99
50543,ELAINE, Let's start the bidding.,99
50544,GEORGE," So, you didn't think this was a date?",99
50545,DEBBY," N... no, not really. Why, is it... a date?",99
50546,GEORGE, I thought it was a date.,99
50547,DEBBY, No. It's not a date.,99
50548,GEORGE, What about the regards?,99
50549,DEBBY," Regards don't mean anything. I mean, it's not like I said hi. Hey, the fact is...  I shouldn't say anything.",99
50550,GEORGE," No, tell me.",99
50551,DEBBY, Can you keep a secret?,99
50552,GEORGE, Me? Oh yeah.,99
50553,DEBBY,"  I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick. But, h... he was so brave and... and gained such a wonderful perspective on life. I... I fell in love with him.",99
50554,GEORGE," Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.",99
50555,JERRY," Hey, do you know what the Whip does?",99
50556,KRAMER, What whip?,99
50557,JERRY," The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.",99
50558,KRAMER," Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them.  You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. ",99
50559,GARY," She won't talk to anyone, huh? Oh no, she won't say a word to anybody. Well, she's talking a blue streak now, Jack!",99
50560,COP," Well, well. The 'white whale'.",99
50561,GEORGE,"  Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.",99
50562,DEBBY," Don't complain, at least you have your health.",99
50563,DEBBY," George, look out for that man!",99
50564,COP,"  Hey! Hey, get back here!",99
50565,KRAMER,  Newman! The white whale!,99
50566,GEORGE, Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?,99
50567,JERRY, Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?,99
50568,GEORGE, No. Definitely not.,99
50569,JERRY, Yeah.,99
50570,GEORGE, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.,99
50571,JERRY, And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.,99
50572,GEORGE, The one who always sits by herself?,99
50573,JERRY, Yeah!,99
50574,GEORGE, How did he do that?,99
50575,JERRY, Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.,99
50576,GEORGE, Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!,99
50577,JERRY," She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?",99
50578,GEORGE,  He picked her up?,99
50579,JERRY, Walked right over to her table.,99
50580,GEORGE, Wow. ,99
50581,ELAINE," Jake, Jake. Take a look.  Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.",99
50582,JAKE, Where did you get those?,99
50583,ELAINE, Malaysia. I was in the area.,99
50584,NEWMAN,  Kramer.,99
50585,KRAMER, Just drive.,99
50586,KRAMER," All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.",99
50587,NEWMAN,  What're you talking about...,99
50588,KRAMER,"  Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.",99
50589,NEWMAN," All right, so it's me. So what?",99
50590,KRAMER," You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.",99
50591,NEWMAN," I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!",99
50592,KRAMER," Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?",99
50593,NEWMAN, I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.,99
50594,KRAMER, So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?,99
50595,NEWMAN,"  Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody.  Help me Kramer! Help me!",99
50596,KRAMER," All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.",99
50597,GEORGE, I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.,99
50598,JERRY," You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.",99
50599,GEORGE," Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.",99
50600,JERRY, What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?,99
50601,GEORGE," The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.",99
50602,JERRY," So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out  'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'.  Aahh!",99
50603,LIPPMAN," It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house, and if this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna do. If I can get this whole thing off the ground, then , you know, I think I'll have something for you. ",99
50604,ELAINE," Oh, Mr Lippman.  That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.",99
50605,LIPPMAN," Yeah, by the way, those are great glasses.",99
50606,ELAINE," Oh really, you like 'em?",99
50607,LIPPMAN, Uh huh. Very unusual.,99
50608,ELAINE," Well, you know what? ",99
50609,LIPPMAN, What?,99
50610,ELAINE,  You can have 'em.,99
50611,LIPPMAN," Oh, no no no.  Please.",99
50612,ELAINE," No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.",99
50613,LIPPMAN, Really?,99
50614,ELAINE," Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.",99
50615,LIPPMAN,  I could use a new pair of reading glasses.,99
50616,ELAINE, They're from Malaysia.,99
50617,LIPPMAN,  Oh yeah?,99
50618,ELAINE,  Fabulous.,99
50619,JUDGE," Well Mr Newman, in all my years on the bench, I have never come across anything quite like this. I have given this matter some very serious consideration and I've decided that what's best for the city and possibly for yourself, is for you to keep your car, in a garage...",99
50620,JUDGE, ...convenient to your home.,99
50621,NEWMAN,  I can't afford that!,99
50622,JUDGE," Afford it you will, Mr Newman. Or this court will see that your car is impounded...",99
50623,JUDGE, ...and sold at auction.,99
50624,KRAMER," Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.",99
50625,GEORGE,"  Well, what d'you think?",99
50626,JERRY,"  I, really can't say.",99
50627,GEORGE," No, say. I want you to say.",99
50628,JERRY," It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look  stupid.  I'm sorry.",99
50629,SALESMAN, You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp.,99
50630,GEORGE,  I really think this looks pretty good.,99
50631,JERRY," Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?",99
50632,GEORGE,"  Well, maybe you could show me something else.",99
50633,SALESMAN," As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically for you. But I don't think your friend here is being very helpful.",99
50634,JERRY," Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!",99
50635,SALESMAN,"  No, I don't think you're being helpful! I think you're being disruptive, and you make it very difficult for your friend here to improve his life!",99
50636,JERRY," Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!",99
50637,SALESMAN,  All you people with hair think you're so damn superior! You have no idea what it's like. You ever look down in the bottom of your tub and see a fist fulla hair? How'd you like to start your day with that?! ,99
50638,JERRY, All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.,99
50639,GEORGE,  Jerry!,99
50640,JERRY, I'm sorry.,99
50641,GEORGE, Please. ,99
50642,GARY," Hey Jerry, th...  George, you decided to get a rug! Good for you, Jack!",99
50643,GEORGE," Well, I'm, I'm just looking.",99
50644,GARY," Oh.  Uh, Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment.",99
50645,SALESMAN, I'll be right with you.,99
50646,GARY," Listen, George, I got some bad news. I'm not gonna be able to give you that parking space.",99
50647,GEORGE, What?,99
50648,JERRY, What?,99
50649,GARY, This judge has to use it for some scofflaw. And you know you can't fight City Hall.,99
50650,JERRY," You know, Gary  I had a little chat with George the other day...",99
50651,GARY,  You didn't?!,99
50652,GEORGE,  I did.,99
50653,JERRY,  ...and he told me that that... ,99
50654,GARY,  I'm not a hundred percent recovered yet!,99
50655,JERRY, Gimme that thing!,99
50656,GEORGE, How's your life? All right?,99
50657,WOMAN," Yeah, not bad at all.",99
50658,LIPPMAN,"  And now, uh, ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr Jake Jarmel. ",99
50659,REPORTER," So Jake, what's your percentage on this book?",99
50660,LIPPMAN," Oh, actually I, uh, I have some very interesting information on that.  You know, uh, this is a co-venture and as...",99
50661,JAKE,  Where did you get those?,99
50662,LIPPMAN," ... as such, it...",99
50663,JAKE," Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?",99
50664,LIPPMAN,  Where... what?,99
50665,JAKE,  Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because it's not very funny.  Give me those!  I want the glasses! Give me those!,99
50666,ELAINE,  'Scuse me. Have to go  look for some socks.,99
